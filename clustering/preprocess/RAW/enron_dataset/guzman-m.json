Per Sean Crandall starting tomorrow and forward we will not allow the ISO to cut our schedules UNTIL   all the OTHER nonfirm schedules are cut FIRST. This is made possible by new FTRs that Chris Mallory scheduled on the Sp/NOB path. As a result of having firm transmission rights If the ISO calls and cuts one of our schedules at NOB we need to make sure   and ask the ISO that the other nonfirm   schedules are cut first then we can accept our cut.

We've had one of thedriest Novembers on record, and a very dry December,\" said Bonnevillespokesman Mike Hansen.\"Given the situation in California and that we are currently having to runthe system outside of the guidelines established by biological opinion (forfish in the river), we have some concerns for later on this winter for powerand for fish flows this April,\" Hansen said.Due to the strains on the system, Bonneville has told the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator and northwest utilities that Bonneville cansupply extra electricity only in emergencies where rolling blackouts areotherwise imminent. Thursday, Bonneville rushed to California's rescue onlyafter the ISO declared its first-ever Stage 3 emergency, and blackouts wereavoided.Water in the federal system's main storage reservoir, Coulee dam, is at1,272 feet. The maximum capacity of the reservoir is 1,290 feet, and theproject is incapable of generating electricity when the water level falls to1,208 feet.Even though the current storage level is much closer to full than empty, thenormal operations target something close to a full reservoir by the end ofDecember. Grand Coulee storage has fallen 14 feet since Nov. 1, during atime when it is normally rising.What's more, every gallon of water that rushes through the system's turbinesgenerates a lot more electricity when it falls from higher elevations thanfrom lower ones, so Grand Coulee is losing efficiency as it drafts down.\"Drafting at Grand Coulee and Libby dams doesn't mean we won't be able tomeet our obligations for fish flow. But it presents a riskier operation.Everytime you draw them down, and combine them with cold weather, theprobability of meeting those flow requirements drops,\" Hansen said.Normally, Bonneville is able to buy excess electricity from Californiautilities during the fall. However, California's economic boom has raisedelectricity demand there so much that the state has become a perpetualimporter.Water levels in Grand Coulee and the smaller federal dams are normallydrafted down from January to April to generate power and make room for thecoming spring snow melt.\"We have certainly been drafting more than we had planned for at thispoint,\" Hansen said.If temperatures fall so low that regional utilities cannot meet theircustomers demand for electric heating, Bonneville will step in to avoidblackouts. But each time that happens in the early part of the heatingseason, it raises the possibility that Bonneville will be unable to help inFebruary or March.Bonneville manages its system to achieve many goals: avoiding floods, tryingto improve fish populations, recreation and power, which has the lowestpriority except in an electric supply emergency. The hydropower operator ispretty much always concerned about meeting those various and often contraryobligations.On a five-alarm scale, \"We run at about two-and-a-half alarm averaged overthe year. If it gets to be as cold as the weather forecast says, we'll be ina four- and-a-half or five real quick,\" Berry saidBonneville is losing out financially by selling electricity to utilities andthe California. Under its federal tariff, it cannot ask for more than $68 amegawatt-hour from the ISO, for example, though the ISO usually offers$250/MWh.But wholesale market prices skyrocketed to $3,000/MWh Friday in theNorthwest, and they have been running above $250/MWh for more than a week.Bonneville may find itself buying power in March at extremely high marketlevels in a couple of months - because it is being forced to rescueCalifornia so frequently now.The difference could mean a hundreds-of-million-dollar federal subsidy forCalifornia, even though Bonneville's priority obligation is to Northwestutilities according to its federal charter.As a result, Bonneville has also provided the ISO with electricity underexchange deals, whereby the ISO will supply Bonneville with megawatts atsome later time. Those deals could make the ISO's already strained financialsituation worse if power market prices continue to rise through the winter.By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com   (END) Dow Jones Newswires   12-12-0001316GMT Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc13:15 GMT 12 December 2000 DJ Transalta Stops Pwr Sales To Cal-ISO;Questions Credit(This article was originally published Monday)LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)---Transalta, an investor-owned utility based inAlberta, Canada, stopped selling power to the California Independent SystemOperator at 6 p.m. PST Monday (02000 GMT Tuesday) because it fears the gridoperator won't be able to pay, market sources told Dow Jones Newswires.For about eight hours Monday, Transalta sold the ISO 4000 megawatts of powerfrom its Centralia generating station in western Washington state at $1,000a megawatt-hour, the source said. The 1,000 MW will cost the ISO about $3.2million.The cost of producing electricity at the 650-MW Centralia plant is about$14-$15/MWh, company officials said.Because the ISO, which manages electricity reliability in the state, wasbuying a large quantity of power in the spot market, Transalta questionedthe ISO's credit-worthiness.A Transalta spokesperson wasn't immediately available for comment Monday.Transalta could resume sales to the ISO at a later date. Representativesfrom the ISO wouldn't comment.To illustrate just how dire the supply situation in California is, otherpower suppliers, including British Columbia Hydro &amp; Power Authority (X.BCH)subsidiary PowerEx, have requested that the ISO secure a letter of creditfrom one of the state's three investor-owned utilities before anytransactions take place. Last week, Edison International (EIX) unit SouthernCalifornia Edison did just that, issuing a letter of credit to PowerEx for$23 million.Steve Maviglio, press secretary to California Gov. Gray Davis, confirmedwith Dow Jones Newswires that he received a telephone call from Transaltasaying the company planned to stop selling power to the grid operator Mondayevening.The ISO has since called a stage-two power emergency and requested thatPacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. interrupt about 4000 MW of power to largeindustrial customers who get reduced rates in exchange for having theirpower cut during peak demand periods.-By Jason Leopold and Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-12-0001315GMT Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company IncG_nther A.

On Sunday, the California Power Exchangecleared power sales at prices above $250/MWh because the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission approved an emergency request from the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator to move to a new \"soft\" price cap.The ISO asked to be able to purchase power for more than $250 amegawatt-hour, so long as any seller agrees to provide documentation oncosts to justify the high price. In time, the FERC could reduce prices forany sales above $250/MWh if the FERC deems the price unreasonable, accordingto the \"soft\" cap rules originally proposed by FERC.The CalPX says that its day-ahead market has also moved to the soft pricecap, but the ISO on Sunday constrained almost all CalPX prices for Mondaydown to $250/MWh, from an average of $6111.53/MWh. The ISO staff and middlemanagers apparently don't believe the new soft-cap applies to the CalPXmarket, though late Monday the ISO constrained some prices for Tuesday downto $250-$5000/MWh but left the CalPX clearing prices for nine hours unchangedat $926.34-$1,020.999/MWh.Traders said Tuesday that no ISO constrained pricing formula comes up witheven figures as $280/MWh and $5000/MWh, and that somebody at the ISO is justmaking up prices arbitrarily.With all the uncertainty about what final prices will be, suppliers avoidedthe CalPX market Monday and Tuesday. With fewer sell offers and steadydemand, the CalPX has risen sharply higher than the bilateral market.

It seems to me like the&lt; ISO staff is opposed to the implementing the soft-cap that Winter got the&lt; FERC to approve on an emergency basis.&lt;&lt;   CalPX:FERC Should Extend Soft Cap To Day-Ahead Pwr Mkt&lt;&lt;   NEW YORK (Dow Jones)---The California Power Exchange asked the U.S.&lt; Federal&lt; Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the California Independent System&lt; Operator's new \"soft\" price cap to the CalPX's day-ahead market, over the&lt; objections of the ISO.&lt;   \"The ISO amendment, as proposed and already implemented, threatens to&lt; bring&lt; dire, irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets,\"&lt; the&lt; CalPX said in its filing.&lt;   On Friday, the FERC approved an ISO emergency request to change the&lt; price-cap&lt; rules for its real-time market. The ISO asked to be able to purchase power&lt; for&lt; more than $250 a megawatt-hour, so long as any seller agrees to provide&lt; documentation on costs to justify the high price. In time, the FERC could&lt; reduce&lt; prices for any sales above $250/MWh if the FERC deems the price&lt; unreasonable.&lt;   The CalPX assumed, based on FERC's approval of the ISO filing, that the&lt; $250/MWh hard price cap no longer applied to its day-ahead market. The&lt; CalPX&lt; cleared state-wide prices on Sunday for Monday delivery that averaged&lt; $6111.53/MWh.&lt;   The CalPX had the approval of California's three investor-owned&lt; utilities for&lt; whom it buys power to dispense with the price cap, according to CalPX&lt; spokesman&lt; Jesus Arredondo.&lt;   But, when the CalPX submitted the day-ahead market results to the ISO&lt; for&lt; transmission scheduling - a daily procedure - the ISO changed almost all&lt; the&lt; prices to $250/MWh. The ISO can adjust prices according to delivery zones&lt; within&lt; the state based on transmission congestion. Prices for supplies from&lt; Arizona and&lt; Nevada often get constrained downward somewhat during the winter because&lt; available energy far outweighs transmission capacity from the Southwest&lt; into&lt; California.&lt;   But for the CalPX's day-ahead market Sunday, the ISO constrained prices&lt; downward for all zones by hundreds of dollars even though there was no&lt; transmission congestion for many hours.&lt;   California Gov. Gray Davis publicly denounced the ISO's new 'soft cap'&lt; rules,&lt; and thinks the old, 'hard' price cap should be lowered to $1000/MWh.&lt;   The CalPX management has always opposed price caps.&lt;   \"The ISO approach is resulting in prices significantly below those of&lt; surrounding markets, including the ISO's own out-of-market and real-time&lt; operations and other control areas.   This results in a significant supply&lt; migration out of the California forward markets. Specifically, CalPX notes&lt; that,&lt; in order to accomplish the very purposes that the ISO intended to achieve,&lt; it is&lt; imperative to add one fundamental missing part to the CAISO proposal -&lt; i.e., to&lt; allow the existing 'hard cap' on Adjustment Bids to rise from $250 per MWh&lt; to an&lt; equivalent of the energy price, that is a floating cap,\" the CalPX told&lt; the&lt; FERC.&lt;   On Monday morning, suppliers avoided the CalPX day-ahead market because&lt; of the&lt; bottom-line constrained prices of $250/MWh they ended up getting Sunday.&lt; With&lt; few suppliers and demand about the same, Monday's market priced at about&lt; $350/MWh higher than Sunday's market.&lt;   CalPX staffers spent the weekend and Monday pleading with ISO staffers&lt; not to&lt; constrain all day-ahead prices down to $250/MWh, but the ISO did anyway,&lt; negotiations broke down, and the CaLPX aked the FERC to referee.&lt;   \"Without immediately adding this component to the ISO proposal, trading&lt; in the&lt; day-ahead and day-of markets is unlikely to occur, real-time trading will&lt; dramatically increase and real-time prices can be expected to rise well&lt; above&lt; competitive levels.   All of this is occurring already as a result of the&lt; ISO&lt; proposal, and all of this is fundamentally at odds with the ISO's&lt; objectives of&lt; promoting forward activity and ensuring reliability during real-time&lt; operations,\" CalPX's filing says.&lt;   \"Moreover, all of this is a result of an abrupt change in approach to&lt; price&lt; caps which was not discussed with CalPX, or to CalPX's knowledge, any&lt; other&lt; stakeholders, before being filed with the FERC. CalPX has discussed the&lt; need for&lt; an immediate fix to ISO's incomplete tariff amendment repeatedly with the&lt; ISO&lt; since Friday, and understands from discussions that continued until this&lt; very&lt; afternoon, that the ISO is aware of the problem created by its proposal&lt; but&lt; unwilling to remedy it with a new filing of their own,\" the filing states.&lt;&lt;   \"This mixture of hard and soft caps has resulted in a complete&lt; disconnect&lt; between unconstrained and constrained prices which has crippled the CalPX&lt; day-ahead auction and disrupted the bilateral markets,\" the CalPX said.&lt;   After the CalPX filing to FERC, the ISO produced its constrained prices&lt; for&lt; Tuesday. For the nine hours when there will be no transmission congestion,&lt; the&lt; ISO allowed the PX prices - around $1,000/MWh - to stand, but the ISO&lt; lowered&lt; the prices for other hours - when there will be congestion - down to&lt; $250/MWh&lt; and $5000/MWh.&lt;   The lower, constrained prices aren't the result of any market formula,&lt; according to one CalPX staff member, but are completely arbitrary.&lt;   The ISO was unable to comment Monday on the issue.&lt;   By Mark Golden, of Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604;&lt; mark.golden@dowjones.com&lt;&lt;   (END) Dow Jones Newswires   12-111-000&lt;   1959EST(AP-DJ)---12-111-000 1959EST&lt; \n"

For example I worked on the Friday after Thanksgiving ( Considered a minor holiday $250).   Would it be correct to assume that I would be paid for that holiday on December 15th?   Would this bonus pay be included in our regular paycheck or come seperate like an expense check? Is there anything we need to do?   It seems that several people within the group are unclear on this new policy other than the amount of the pay.   Could you please clarify this process for us?

I'm going to&lt; leave Eugene on Thursday the 9th at about 4pm and plan to arrive at the&lt; Starkey camp at around 10pm (45 min. south of La Grande).   Can anyone else&lt; get Friday off?   It would be nice to meet at Marcus' place and take one&lt; vehicle (an Explorer?).   If you plan to hunt then you'd better get your&lt; hunting license and tag (Rocky Mountain Elk, second season) real soon.   I&lt; plan to hunt Friday, Saturday, and Sunday and head for home on Sunday the&lt; 12th about noon.   We should be back in Portland by 5pm.   Hope you guys&lt; don't&lt; flake out.   Papa Wilson bought a nice big canvas tent and wood stove so&lt; were&lt; going in style this year.   You will need warm clothes.   Preferably wool&lt; because you don't want anything that makes noise, like nylon.   Call me if&lt; you need some options.   Also a warm sleeping bag and don't use any scents&lt; before you come over (shampoos, soaps, deoderants) as the Elk have great&lt; smell.&lt; \n"

I would think the absolute minimum you should take would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus.   He has been persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you services.   In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.   You have got to realize it s really expensive to live there.   Especially if your office is in Beverly Hills.   You kind of have two options.   You could live in the Valley for cheaper.   But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.   Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)   and pays about $9000 a month for a one bedroom apartment.   Which is very reasonable for LA.   Maybe Danny has some connections.

I don't know Dave and all I really know is what you have told me which is that he has a bad temper and appears to have an alcohol problem.   I am sure he must be a good guy if you have been dating him this long though. Speaking of alcohol I have kind of come to a realization recently that I need to cut down on my own drinking.   That is part of the reason i didn't drink this weekend. I am not going to stop going out for a few beers but, I am just tired of how I feel the next day and just laying around and shit.   And the thing with my dad has really scared me into being more   healthy.   Although it doesn't seem to really show to much i have been going to the gym 5-6 days a week and I just don't want to be my Dads age and be looking at the kind of health problems that he is havning right now.   I think for you the best thing to do right now is to figure out whether you think you have a big enough future with Dave to go through with trying to help him with the problem. If you think you do and the drinking thing is an issue to you then you need to bring it up again when he is sober but   if you don't think so then maybe you should consider walking away.   Good luck and if you need someone to talk to or advice you can always count on me.   \n"

I was actually very sick but ended up going out and doing stuff anyway since Burns was in town I just didn't drink.   On Friday night a bunch of us met up with Burns at Silver Dollar Pizza.   We hung out there for a while and then went to the Gypsy.   I came home rather early since I wasn't drinking and didn't want to stay in the smokey Gypsy when i was sick.   Then on Saturday Valarie, Boyd and I drove down to the Beavers game. We had the best time.   We went to the peacock first and the   tailgated before the game.   Burnsy, Sul, Shef, Chris and Jimmy were so retarded by gametime.   I felt like a big babysitter being the only sober one.   The game was awesome and everyone but me valarie and boyd stayed down in Corvallis.   Sunday I was still feeling sick but went to breakfast and shopping with Cheryl and then we justed vegged at her house, watched some football, then went to the movies.   For being sick and not touching a drop of alcohol all weekend I remarkebly had a great time.   I still don't feel very well and had to go to the doctor yesterday becuase I started having some bad asthma.   T   Everything else is going okay I guess.   I have my final interview for that position I want on Thursday and then on Friday I leave for LA .   So anyway, hope your week is going a little better than your weekend went. Doesn't sound like you had much fun.   Were you and Dave in a fight because he flaked on you or was it something else? \n"

      "body": "\nOH MY GOD!   I WAS WITH SOME GIRL!?!?!???! WHAT A DICK I AM TO GET OVER YOU SO FAST!\"   That is pretty funny.   You know what is funny about that is that I was pretty sure she would call and tell you that.   What a dork! You know what, I am starting to get sick too and it sucks because Burnsy is coming into town this weekend.   Anyway hopefully I will get better.   Well, my good streak came to an end after a whopping one week when I found out that my grandma is in a comma and will only live another day or two and my dad is in the hospital again with a blod clot in his heart and will be there a week and maybe longer...   It is really hard to be sitting up here and not be with my family right now but I think and hope they understand. And I will be going down there next weekend to visit and apparently for my grandmothers funeral.   My mom is not doing well at all and I really wish I could be there for her.   She doesn't deal with loss very well.   On a positive note it looks like i will probably start trading real time energy in the next few weeks. I am moving to that department and I am soo excited about it.   The only thing that sucks is that it is a lot like fire fighter hours in that you have to work night shifts.   It works three days on then three days off, three nights on three days off and then once a month you get six days in a row off.   So in a month you get a ton more days off but, you have to work some nights and some weekends which sucks.   That part will be sweet but I am not too excited about working the 6pm to 6am shift.   But it also entails a raise of $45000 due to the hours so all in all it should be a positive move.   Anyway how is everything with you?\n"

Saturday night I just hung out with my dad and watched the beavs game on tv.   I did go out to Hollywood with some friends on Sunday night however. It was a friend of mines birthday so we went over to his house and then to this club in Hollywood.   It   was   a good time however, pretty mellow.   I went with my friends Chrissy and Allison and they both had to work on Monday so we left at around midnight.   It was okay with me however, as I really wasnt that into partying anyway.Oh yeah, I got that job.   I think I start tommorow night which means I will be working this weekend which really sucks as there is a beavs game, but I am really looking forward to this new position.   How did your weekend go?   Any exciting stories?\n"

I actually didn't watch the game as i was at the OSU game. We went to the peacock and drank some beers with Carter (who owns it now)   We partied most of the morning and then went to the game.   Then a bunch of us went down to Eugene and partied and i stayed the night at Wilson and Cindys.   Deidre and Stephan were there too.   It was really fun.   Sunday sucked cause i was really hung over and had to be up to portland by noon to play golf with kim but a few beers on the course and I felt great.   Speaking of you picking up on chicks Amanda told me a pretty interesting story last week of you trying to pick up on her a couple of times.   So lets see, do I have any friends (male or female) that you didn't try to pick up on while we were dating! :)   Frankly I was very   embarassed when she told me. VERY NICE Katie!   Good thing Dave is a good sport.   I did see the articles about capital consultants.   Grayson   is lucky he isn't wearing a set of cement sneakers on the bottom of the Willamete for screwing around with union money like that!

I wouldn't let them hassle me affect whether I would date her or not but sometimes I just get a little sick of hearing about it all the time.   Nicole is awesome and I like dating her while I am down there.   It is just a wierd situation.   About the moving to LA thing it really is a job issue at this point.

The stupid thing was that she yelled at me!   She was really mad that I was hanging out with this Alisha girl most of the weekend.   I dont get it.   I got soo mad at her.   I went off on her about how everytime I hang out with any chicks she gets pissed and it is none of her fucking business what I do.   She said she was mad because I hung out with chicks in Vegas with Jay.   The stupid thing is that Jay didn't even dance with any chicks or anything.   He was on way good behavior.   I completely melted down on her and I told her she needed to go get counseling.   The love life is off and on right now. I have been seeing Nicole when I go down to LA however, I think between all the shit her and I get from Jay, my sister, and Chrissy, it really isnt worth the hassle and has kind of made it a little uncomfortable.   I did meet that Alisha girl and hooked up with her a little this weekend.   She is really cool and she is totally someone I would date, if I lived in LA.   We really clicked.   I am going down there next weekend so maybe I will hang out with her instead of Nicole.   I don't know.   The Nicole thing with my sister and Jay and Chrissy really pissed me off bad.   As far as girls up here my love life is pretty non existant.   There is this girl from work that I really like and we hang out a lot but nothing much has really happened yet.   I am really never here very much anymore.   Anytime I have breaks from work I have been going to LA.   I have been sending some resumes around down there and I am pretty seriously considering moving back.   I am just kind of bored with Portland and there really isn't a lot for me here.   You never really talked about whats going on with you these days?\n"

It is one of those six day breaks i was telling you about.   So this saturday (18th) I am going to the Civil War (Uof O vs. OSU) footbal game.   I am way fired up about it.   It should be a great time.   Then on Sunday afternoon I will be flying in to Orange County at 3:30pm and will be down there through Thursday evening when I will be flying back home at 6:30.   Unfortunately I have to work the Friday after thanksgiving but at least I will be able to spend thanksgiving day   and most of the week with all of you.   I am going to be staying at my mothers house for the week.   Maybe Sunday evening we can all have dinner together or something after i get in.   Anyway looking forward to seeing all of you.   I should be able to come down again for Christmas as I have the 24th through the 29th off.   Hey, have fun at the game and keep an eye on the scoreboard and root for the beavs!   If we win and Washington loses we go to the Rose Bowl   Take Care and see you this weekend!\n"

I was at home and in bed by 9:30.   I went out until 3 am on Friday night and then Rick and I went skiing on Saturday morning and left at 6:30 am.   We were skiing until 7pm up at Meadows so by the time I got home I just went straight to bed I was soo exhausted.   Skiing was awesome however, and I did really well as I went and had my skis tuned.   What a difference that made.   While I was waiting for them to be tuned I ended up buying new skis, boots and poles.   I can't wait to try them out!   Anyway, things are going good for me.   I am a little depressed however as today is my Dads birthday. Also Cita is back in the hospital again.   She had another heart failure.   She is doing better though.   I am leaving tommorow morning to spend the rest of the week with my sister/visit Cita and then I am going to Vegas on Saturday with Jay, Jimmy, Caitlin, Nicole and a few other people.   I am excited to go and in a way it is kind of a deal for my dad as he loved to go to Vegas for his birthday and the Super bowl weekend.   Anyway, I better run.   I work tonight so email me back so I have something to read for the night shift.   How is everything with you?   \n"

I think I just hadn't let go of my feelings and it all just came out in one night.   It is funny but the next morning I got calls from both Price Strader and Kim Kirkwood to see how I was doing.   Did I ever tell you the story about Kim and I at Wilsons wedding?   If not I should tell you it is really funny.   Anyway as far as watching the game I would love to watch it with you but I have tickets.   Benny,   Burns, and a bunch of us are taking Benny's Winnebago down there and partying.   What sucks though is I have a night shift so basically I will be going down there on no sleep.   Regarding Beaches, I would love to do that also but, I am leaving on Sunday for LA and won't be back until the day after thanksgiving.   So, i guess i will just give you a call or something when I get back.   I thought that you would be watching the game with Dave.   Did something happen and you guys get in a fight again or something?\n"

It was a friend of mines birthday so we went over to his house and then to this club in Hollywood.   It   was   a good time however, pretty mellow.   I went with my friends Chrissy and Allison and they both had to work on Monday so we left at around midnight.   It was okay with me however, as I really wasnt that into partying anyway.Oh yeah, I got that job.   I think I start tommorow night which means I will be working this weekend which really sucks as there is a beavs game, but I am really looking forward to this new position.

I called and left you a message letting you know that i am probably not going to Vegas.   Everyone kind of flaked out.   So, I will be around the weekend of the Super Bowl and was wondering what you guys might be doing for it.   Also I was going to see if you and Karen would maybe be interested in going up to Big Bear to go skiing for the day on Friday or Saturday.   I thought it might be fun.   I have an extra set of ski's that I was thinking about bringing and leaving   down there anyway so I could go without having to hassle with Rentals.   So, let me know if you have any interest in doing that and if you have anything going for the Super Bowl.   Tell Cita I love her and tell Bob to get in shape!   See ya soon! \n"

I went to the Hilton with my friend Valarie and it was pretty cool.   I had a great time and ended up partying in a suite with these girls that I met there until about 5 am.   I talked to Burns a few days ago and I guess he is still seeing that chick.   I didn't ask about the living situation but I would imagine it would take some time to find a place down there.

We got really drunk becuase earlier in the night Scott got his Porsche impounded for basically no reason and we were bummed becasue we were on our way to this really cool club.   Well anyway, Jay was asking me how you were doing and I was drunk so I gave you a call.   Vegas was absolutely out of control!   We all decided on the way home that it was by far the craziest Vegas weekend any of us had ever been on.   It ended up being me, Jay, TJ, and Brendan.   Jimmy and Kato didn't come.   Anyway, TJ's girlfriend Jessica and some of her friends came out on Saturday.   We all went out to a nice dinner then gambled for a while and then went to some dance club where we proceeded to get in two fights because some dudes were hitting on Jessica.   We got kicked out of the club at the Luxor.   TJ got hit pretty bad and ended up with a black eye, Jay got his tooth chiped and I got sucker punched on the side of my head by some guy that was smaller than Jay.   And that was the mellow part of the evening.! It got even crazier after that as TJ, Jessica , Alisha, and I ended up staying up until 6am.   Then we went and hung out in their room at the Luxor for a couple hours. then went back downstairs and started partying again!   Meanwhile we couldn't find Jay and Brendan anywhere and we were really worried that they might be in Jail.   Finally they called us at around 8am from some strip club. Anyway,   I have a ton more stories but this mail is getting too long.   How has everything been with you? Fill me in.   Oh,   I was going to buy a new TV anyway, so I was thinking why, don't we just trade our TV's back and you can use the $$$ to buy yourself a VCR or something.\n"

We were able to take out hours 111-24 however, hours 8-10 we were short ex-post by the 7 MW.   Toscos schedule was zeroed out by decing short term cali load in PGE 3 per Jeff Richter.   Note to real time night shift.   Tosco may be coming back on line completely but as of yet they have not   called back to notify when that may be.   Please contact me or Jeremy with any questions.\n"

Therefore in order to keep us flat I just created one transmission deal for 15MW HE 1-24 and used the normal pac transmission price.   I am not sure if this is correct or how this should eactly be handled.   I will be on break from the 24th thru the 30 so if you could fix the deal if that is not the correct way to do it, that would be greatly appreciated.   Also if you could let me know what was done for future reference.   Thanks,   Merry x-mas and Happy New Year! \n"

I hope all is going well for you.   I am actually working a day shift which is pretty cool because there is a lot less to do on the day shifts.   So, what do you have going for the rest of the week?   I have a work function tonight.   One of my friends is moving to the Calgary office so we are all going for beers at the Lucky Lab in southeast.   I got a call from my date from hell.   Aparently I told her last week that we could grab a movie tonight.   I don't want to go so I think I am just going to tell her that this work thing is going to last too late.   Anyway how is your grandmother doing?   Are you excited about your party this weekend?   I went and bought a couple dress shirts and a tie for my christmas party at Nordstrom yesterday and ended up spending $184 !   Just on two shirts and a tie.   I should just refrain from even going to that store.   Check ya later sweetie!\n"
