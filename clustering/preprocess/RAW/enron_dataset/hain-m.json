Generally, an industrial would be required to obtain its own FERC power marketer license (takes about 60 days) in order to sell into the grid.   EPMI and EES have not requested the \"Impower\" type agent authority yet, but I have been asked to file this for EPMI (and, Dennis, we could file for EES too, let me know). If FERC allows EPMI and EES to do this, then we would make quarterly filings on behalf of any industrials from whom we buy power at wholesale and they would not have to make their own FERC power marketer filings.   (Also, Enron generally has to also file for \"EWG\" Exempt Wholesale Generator status due to utility rules; however, if the industrial is primarily an industrial business in something other than power generation, an EWG determination is not required.)I will keep you advised on the status of the filing(s) once made. Subject: In Power Marketing ---FERC orderOn 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to InPower (on a profit share basis).   InPower made the filing stating it estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).   InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises approved by the local utility.   Further, the generation must be capable of producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or commensurate with agreements with the local utility.   Total sales made by IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.   The IPPs are in businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking \"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets.\"When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's jurisdiction as a \"public utility.\"   Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at peak times).   FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made to those suppliers.This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market based rates authority.   The are some additional reporting requirements FERC waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed). Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.\n"

We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.   We decided to do nothing rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.   Moreover, it's my understanding that we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has correctly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement actions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above the price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).   I could do one of several things for you at this point:Stay quietSend the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and will not report unless and until we doCall the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our backAsk Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSAI am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the \"Dirty 13\" list) and we'll end up in the press again.   To lay low, I'm inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.   What do others think?   Traders - please verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.---"

Mr. Fielder stated that SCE wasproviding notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISO Tariff \"thatSCE will not be performing all of its obligations under the ISO Tariffbecause it will not be paying every invoice due to Uncontrollable Forces, asdefined in the ISO Tariff.\"   Mr. Fielder stated that the UncontrollableForces were \"regulations and restrictions imposed by governmentalauthorities, including without limitation, the CPUC's order of January 4,20001, that failed to authroize SCE to obtain, and restricted SCE fromobtaining sufficient funds to enable SCE to meet its payment obligations.\"Mr. Fielder further stated that, \"[b]ecause SCE's action is due toUncontrollable Forces, the ISO should not attempt to exercise any remediesagainst SCE for non-performance and SCE will hold the ISO responsible forthe consequences of the ISO exercising any such remedies.\"   Finally, Mr.Fielder stated that SCE was using its best efforts to mitigate the effectsof the regulations and restrictions and would continue to do so.   The CEO ofthe California ISO has written to Mr. Fielder stating that it is studyingthe position taken in Mr. Fielder's letter and that for the moment itneither accepts nor rejects the position.   The purpose of this market noticeis to fully inform Market Participants who may have claims directly againstSCE based on SCE's failure to pay ISO invoices.\n"

Likelihood that Bankruptcy Court will grant PX motion to modify stay; including feasibility and effort by parties to file answer in support of motion, including whether it would be realistic to request that the PX's motion be considered on a more expedited basis (PX asked for 3/30 hearing date) in light of the FERC Complaint proceeding;2.   Status and approach for possible settlement with PX for release of collateral assuming Bankruptcy Court modifies stay.3.   Feasibility of asking Bankruptcy Court to immediately release all collateral in excess of amount needed to satisfy (1) vendors, (2) existing and anticipated future defaults of SCE and PG&amp;E, and (3) reasonable costs.   In this regard, does anyone have a handle on whether the collateral exceeds the total of the foregoing matters?4.   Any comments on (1) answer to PX answer to Complaint, and (2) answer to PX request for clarification in Amendment No. 222 proceeding; including the timing of such filings with FERC.This email does not address bankruptcy counsel for all parties.   If you wish to have your client's bankruptcy counsel on the call, please inform them of the time and relevant information for the call.This call will likely be extremely unwieldy, so I would request the parties to consolidate their participants where possible.   Also, please do not forward this information as it addresses confidential litigation matters.   Thanks.   See you Monday.   Ron\n"

      "body": "\nCalif Senate Takes Up Bill On Deal With Small Generators? 02/23/20001 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) (This article was originally published Thursday.)   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- California Republican Sen. Jim Battin on Thursday introduced legislation that will enable the state's electric utilities and small, independent generators to proceed with a new deal on pricing power supplies. The bill, if enacted, would lower the prices paid to so-called qualifying facilities to about 8 cents a kilowatt-hour from about 17 cents/kWh and would require California utility regulators to ensure that utilities could recover those costs from ratepayers. The new pricing would be retroactive to Feb. 1, 20001, and would run until June 30, 20006. \"This bill is a linchpin to solving the California energy crisis,\" Battin said in a press release. Qualifying facilities produce almost 30% of California 's electricity. While the individual power plants are relatively small, some big energy companies own several qualifying facilities each in California . These owners include Calpine Corp. (CPN), FPL Group (FPL), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Ogden Corp. (OG), Thermo Electron (TMO) and MidAmerican Energy Holdings, which was bought out last year by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.A,BRK.B). Passage would allow several companies to restart some 1,000 megawatts of gas-fired generators that have been off line for several weeks. Those generators shut down their gas-fired plants, because they were unable to pay gas suppliers after the utilities fell behind on their power payments. The bill, SB47X, encompasses an agreement reached among the parties and is expected to be enacted. The generators and PG&amp;E Corp's (PCG) Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. reached an agreement on the new prices two weeks ago. It wasn't clear Thursday if Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison had signed off on the agreement, according to one of the lead negotiators. Edison wasn't able to comment immediately. Under the legislation, gas-fired cogeneration plants, which account for two-thirds of California 's qualifying facilities, will be paid based on the cost of signing a five-year gas supply contract. The producers will negotiate five-year contracts, subject to approval by the utilities, or accept a benchmark five-year gas price still to be determined. To take effect immediately as an emergency act, the bill requires approval by two-thirds of both the state Senate and Assembly. If the bill is passed, a process for quickly determining the five-year gas price would begin. Most of the small power plants that run on renewable sources such as solar panels, windmills and hydroelectric generators, will be paid a fixed price of 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the bill. The non-gas plants will also be paid about 2 cents/kwh for having the capacity available for the utilities. Previously, qualifying facilities were paid based on the spot price of natural gas at the California border, or, if the generator had elected, the California Power Exchange daily clearing price. But generators conceded that the California gas spot market had risen so sharply over the past six months that their power prices had become insupportable. The CalPX has stopped operating its market. Both PG&amp;E and Edison have defaulted on qualifying facility payments, but the bill sets up a schedule for recovery of missed payments. The utilities are to pay for November 2000 deliveries by April 2, for December deliveries by May 1, and for January 20001 deliveries by June 1. PG&amp;E paid its November bill on time. Calpine owns the most qualifying facilities in California . Of Calpine's 4,4000 MW of total U.S. operational power plants, 575 MW are qualifying facilities under contract with PG&amp;E. FPL Group's FPL Energy owns a little more than 5000 MW of the plants. U.S. utilities have been forced under federal law to buy power from such generators since the oil crisis in the 1970s. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com \n"

I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two possible ways this action is unlawful.   First, this violates the banking provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).   These provisions requires the PX to hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.   Second, these are wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent domain concerning retail service.   I don't have any law to support the second idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.   \n"

Here's the article.rEnron: ISO Credit Problems Are Those Of Calif Utilities   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   12/13/2000   Dow Jones Energy Service   (Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   By Mark Golden   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The credit problems of the California Independent System Operator reflect the   credit problems of the state's three investor-owned utilities, Enron Corp. (ENE) chief of staff Steven Kean   said Wednesday.   \"We have expressed some concerns about the utilities' creditworthiness,\" Kean said. \"They wouldn't have   this credit issue if they had a government guarantee.\"   Standard &amp; Poor's credit analyst for California utilities, Richard Cortright, told Dow Jones Newswires that   such a guarantee is highly unlikely.   \"There's no point in talking about it,\" Cortright said.   The credit-rating agency put California utility holding companies PG&amp;E Corp (PCG) and Edison   International (EIX) on watch with negative implications Wednesday. The utilities have seen their debt   rating downgraded already this fall, but their debts are piling up by the billions as they continue to pay   about 10 times more for power supplies than they can charge customers.   \"The sheer magnitute of the undercollected balance is beyond belief,\" Cortright said. \"Wholesale prices   have gotten worse, and every hour the situation gets more dire.\"   Cortright said the only step that would save the utilities' credit status is if California regulators raised the   rates the utilities can charge customers.   Late Wednesday, the California Public Utilties Commission indicated that it may do so, reversing a   decision made just last week.   \"With new generation coming on, you would expect the rates to decline in a couple of years,\" Cortright   said.   The California Independent System Operator almost had to institute rolling blackouts Wednesday   because 13 suppliers had stopped selling it power due to concerns about the ISO's credit.   California Gov. Gray Davis said that Enron was one of the \"dirty 13.\"   Enron's Kean said that Enron was only offering very limited amounts of power to the ISO.   \"We are basically just a buyer and seller. We control only 70 megawatts of generation in the state, which   we offered to the ISO today because of the emergency, but the ISO declined to purchase that power,\"   Kean said.   That small generating unit is located in the southern California, while the ISO's supply problems were   most acute in northern California.   \"We aren't selling any other power to them right now. Everything else that we bought we've sold to other   buyers,\" said Kean, who added that Enron had sold to the ISO as recently as Tuesday.   The ISO manages California's electricity grid and purchases last-minute additional power on behalf of the   state's three investor-owned utilities. The ISO then bills the utilities, which are PG&amp;E Corp's Pacific Gas &amp;   Electric Co, Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison, and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San   Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.   The ISO has 70-day payment terms to suppliers.   For the past two weeks, and often during the summer, the ISO has been purchasing about one-fourth of   the state's entire needs at very high prices. It's current daily power purchases are running at $50 million to   $1000 million.   -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com   \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Frank Hayden @ ENRON   12/14/2000 09:08 AM To: Rebecca Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Article   I can't access the article without Enron's account number...

In a bankruptcy case, there is an automatic stay on actions against the debtor or the debtor's property.   Joe questioned whether the stay applies to our complaint at FERC because of Section 362(b) of the Bankruptcy code which excepts from the stay proceedings commenced by governmental units for the exercise of police and regulatory power.According to Jim, the Bankruptcy court may oppose a sanction for violation of the stay.   He says there is question of whether Section 362(b) applies to our complaint because we initiated it, not FERC.   I said it could be argued whether FERC initiated it under the language of Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.   While he agreed there may be legitimate arguments in that regard, he said that the FERC would want to delay issuing an order until after the court allowed it to act because its order could be deemed a nullity if it violated the automatic stay.   He also said that if the PX did not (contrary to its promise) file to except the FERC's proceeding from the stay, two things could happen.   EPMI could itself file with the bankruptcy court and/or try to get the Court of establish a trustee in the case. *   Apparently, there was a conference call with Elizabeth Sager and others where it was decided that we needed to file this \"Suggestion of Bankruptcy.\"* Since the PX's bankruptcy was filed under Section 111 rather than Section 7 of the bankruptcy code, the PX is still a \"debtor in possession\" and a trustee is not appointed unless parties request it and prove that one is warranted pursuant to the bankruptcy code.   \n"

Hard copies that also include the cover letter, Fed.

And special thanks to the nine companies that agree to join as signatories.For those companies that did not join in, we encourage you to intervene ASAP in support of the complaint, including the request for an immediate suspension of the chargeback before the next round of chargeback invoices come due (which we believe could be as early as Feb. 15).   Since we are asking FERC to suspend the chargeback no later than Feb. 14, your immediate intervention would be very helpful.Thanks again.   Ron - CALPXCOM.DOC\n"

      "body": "\nDue to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the \"California\" markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential refund obligations.   It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its customers.   To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has merely conditioned its rates \"subject to refund.\"   Accordingly, it is inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of insolvency.   It has simply said that \"there is no assurance that the actual wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially may be ordered.\"San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.   This allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.   This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the Commission March 9 order. The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in the market for years - \"pending a final nonappealable order in these proceedings.\"   Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 order finding that it would not order cost based rates.This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of wholesale power \"in the California markets\" not just for sales in the ISO and PX markets.\n"

Revised Draft   ? Conference Call on Tuesday, January 16th, 2:000 p.m.   (EST), 1-8000-937-6563Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversationswith some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of GuidingPrinciples on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference onJanuary 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISOmarkets.   The most significant change from the prior draft is that we nowdelete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices inCalifornia and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for marketmonitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs,opportunity costs and scarcity values.FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at theJanuary 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there isconsensus on this approach.   We will discuss this draft on a conferencecall on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:000 p.m. (EST).   To access the call,please dial 1-8000-937-6563.   Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.

The most significant change from the prior draft is that we nowdelete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices inCalifornia and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for marketmonitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs,opportunity costs and scarcity values.FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at theJanuary 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there isconsensus on this approach.   We will discuss this draft on a conferencecall on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:000 p.m. (EST).   To access the call,please dial 1-8000-937-6563.   Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.   In themeantime, if you have any questions, concerns or ideas about this effort,please contact Julie at 202-789-72000 or jsimon@epsa.org before the call.Attachment(See attached file: MARKET MONITORING2.doc) - MARKET MONITORING2.doc\n"

Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,5000 MW are from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the remainder from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs).   Ridgewood states that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is underutilized because of operating efficiency and other QF requirements.   With a limited waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that these underutilized resources could help relieve current shortages during both peak and off-peak periods.   Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000 MWs would be immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing utility or into the competitive market their \"above-baseline\" output for a limited time period.   Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made at market-based rates and would not be subject to the operating and efficiency standards... Section 292.205&amp;copy; of the Commission's regulations provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and efficiency standards \"upon a showing that the facility will produce significant energy savings\".   However, the Commission has exercised its waiver authority in a number of cases based on factors such as the limited durations of the requested waiver, whether further waivers would be necessary, whether the request was intended to remedy specific problems associated with an innovative technology, and whether granting waiver would fulfill PURPA's goals.   We find that many of these same factors are present here.   Consistent with the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver in this circumstance will provide for increased efficiency in the use of the Cogeneration facilities and improved reliability of electric service through increasing the availability of needed capacity.   Therefore, we will grant temporary waiver of the operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration QFs for sales into California, effective as of the date of this order.   We will terminate the waiver effective January 1, 20001.\" Let me know if you want the entire order. Dan\n"

The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.   We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.   EPMI and EES will be able to file specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.   Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.   We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may be required in order for us to track these purchases.   Thanks.   Christi   370007.---",

The Federal Power Act requires the commission to approve jurisdictional asset transfers greater than $50,000 in value. But FERC doesn't view generation assets as jurisdictional.   FERC often rules on generation asset transfers, but only in the context of associated transmission assets and power sales connected with the generation assets. FERC regulates electricity sales, but not the plants that produce the power.   With divestiture of generation assets becoming increasingly common in the $215 billion U.S. electricity sector, this policy has increasingly been questioned by consumer interests and others.   Most recently, the American Public Power Association and Citizen Power Inc., a utility watchdog group, petitioned the commission to reconsider its view that generation asset transfers, absent associated transmission facilities and power sales agreements, don't fall under FERC jurisdiction.   At issue were generation asset sales by Duquesne Light Co. (DQZ), and FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE) transfer of power plant ownership from its utility operating units to FirstEnergy's competitive services unit.   The commission was unpersuaded by arguments of APPA and Citizens Power that state regulation is inadequate to protect the public interest and promote competition in the restructuring electric utility industry.   \"There is no necessary nexus between the interstate transmission or sale of electric energy, on the one hand, (the triggering events giving rise to our jurisdiction) and the disposition of a generation facility by itself,\" FERC said.   \"Not only does the statutory text support our interpretation, but there is no precedent, legislative history, or case law which would support a contrary conclusion,\" FERC said, denying the petition.   FERC cited section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act as conferring authority to regulate the disposition of \"facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.\" FERC has never asserted jurisdiction over generation assets, and has traditionally left that to state utility regulators.

The Federal Power Act requires the commission to approve jurisdictional asset transfers greater than $50,000 in value. But FERC doesn't view generation assets as jurisdictional.   FERC often rules on generation asset transfers, but only in the context of associated transmission assets and power sales connected with the generation assets. FERC regulates electricity sales, but not the plants that produce the power.   With divestiture of generation assets becoming increasingly common in the $215 billion U.S. electricity sector, this policy has increasingly been questioned by consumer interests and others.   Most recently, the American Public Power Association and Citizen Power Inc., a utility watchdog group, petitioned the commission to reconsider its view that generation asset transfers, absent associated transmission facilities and power sales agreements, don't fall under FERC jurisdiction.   At issue were generation asset sales by Duquesne Light Co. (DQZ), and FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE) transfer of power plant ownership from its utility operating units to FirstEnergy's competitive services unit.   The commission was unpersuaded by arguments of APPA and Citizens Power that state regulation is inadequate to protect the public interest and promote competition in the restructuring electric utility industry.   \"There is no necessary nexus between the interstate transmission or sale of electric energy, on the one hand, (the triggering events giving rise to our jurisdiction) and the disposition of a generation facility by itself,\" FERC said.   \"Not only does the statutory text support our interpretation, but there is no precedent, legislative history, or case law which would support a contrary conclusion,\" FERC said, denying the petition.   FERC cited section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act as conferring authority to regulate the disposition of \"facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.\" FERC has never asserted jurisdiction over generation assets, and has traditionally left that to state utility regulators.

The Governor said&lt; that it has \"become increasingly obvious\" to him that the best solution to&lt; the utilities' financial problems is the \"acquisition of transmission&lt; lines.\"   He noted that the transmission lines are the utilities \"most&lt; significant asset\" and would be something the public would be able to get&lt; value from \"in perpetuity.\"   He said the arrangement will likely be a&lt; \"lease\" of the utilities' lines, with the companies continuing to maintain&lt; them, \"to capture [the utilities'] expertise.\"   Details of this plan will&lt; be announced on Friday, the Governor said.   The time and place for this&lt; announcement have yet to be released.&lt; &lt; The Governor later said he felt the utilities' parent/holding companies&lt; should \"be part of the solution\" so there would be \"shared pain\" in&lt; reaching a solution.&lt; &lt; The Governor said he suspected that acquisition of the transmission lines&lt; will involve the sale of revenue bonds, but he \"didn't have enough wisdom\"&lt; when asked about it to give a firm answer.   He said he believed he would&lt; have that wisdom on Friday. &lt; &lt; The Governor also commented on his plan to police and/or fine business&lt; establishments that keep their lights on after business hours.   He said he&lt; would announce a finalized plan on or around Mar. 15, a specific program&lt; to reduce by 50-70% the amount of energy used by retailers after-hours.&lt; &lt; The Governor did outline the legislative package designed to promote&lt; renewable energy, distributed generation and co-generation through&lt; incentives, rebates and tax credits.   &lt; &lt; The package contains:&lt; 1.) \"Rebate Increase Bill\": \"Emerging Renewable Resources Account of the&lt; Renewable Resource Trust Fund\" = $50 million to increase rebates for&lt; renewable distributed generation systems smaller than 10 kilowatts (this&lt; money will come from the General Fund)&lt; &lt; 2.) Tax Credit Bill: SB 17X (Brulte): A 50% tax credit for the purchase&lt; and installation of renewable distributed generation systems larger than&lt; 10 kilowatts and up to 2000 kilowatts for large facilities such as&lt; apartment complexes and businesses. &lt; &lt; 3.) Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program: AB 53X (Reyes): $50 million&lt; for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable power systems,&lt; distributed generation and co-generation facilities. &lt; &lt; 4.)Retrofitting of Distributed Generation Facilities: This proposal will&lt; provide $20 million to achieve 40 MW of reduced peak load through&lt; retrofitting of natural gas distributed generation units at municipal&lt; water districts to improve environmental performance.   This involves&lt; retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean natural&lt; gas technology. &lt; &lt; 5.)Legislation to Exempt Microgeneration and Renewable Facilities Less&lt; than 1 MW from Standby Charges: Elimination of the standby charges paid by&lt; distributed generation end-use customers to the Investor Owned Utilities.&lt; This includes small co-generation facilities and only applies to units&lt; that generate less than one megawatt. &lt; &lt; ***&lt; &lt; Please find the text of the Governor's press release for this news&lt; conference below:&lt; &lt; FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE&lt; 02/14/20001 2:000 pm &lt; &lt; GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES BILL PACKAGE TO INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY,&lt; DISTRIBUTED GENERATION AND CO-GENERATION &lt; &lt; SACRAMENTO &lt; &lt; Governor Gray Davis today announced a legislative package to provide&lt; incentives to power up more renewable energy, distributed generation and&lt; co-generation to help meet California's energy challenge.&lt; &lt; \"By investing in renewable energy sources, clean distributed generation&lt; and co-generation, we can increase our energy supply without taking power&lt; away from the grid,\" Governor Davis said. \"My generation plan contains the&lt; most ambitious renewable energy program in the nation.\"&lt; &lt; Distributed generation and co-generation are powerful tools for meeting&lt; California's power needs. These types of facilities reduce demand on the&lt; state power grid. They also provide energy independence from the&lt; Independent Systems Operator and the volatile spot market; advanced&lt; technology that creates jobs as well as power; and reliable energy sources&lt; that respect the environment.&lt; &lt; Governor Davis' legislative package for distributed generation,&lt; co-generation and renewable energy includes:&lt; &lt; &lt; 1.   $50 million to increase rebates for renewable distributed generation&lt; systems smaller than ten kilowatts. &lt; 2.   A 50% tax credit for the purchase and installation of renewable&lt; distributed generation systems larger than 10 kilowatts and up to 2000&lt; kilowatts for large facilities such as apartment complexes and businesses.&lt; This will be carried in SB 17x by Senator Jim Brulte (R-Cucamonga). &lt; 3.   $50 million for a commercial loan guarantee program for renewable&lt; power systems, distributed generation and co-generation facilities. This&lt; will be carried in AB 53x by Assemblymember Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno). &lt; 4.   $20 million for retrofit of distributed generation owned by&lt; municipal water districts to improve environmental performance. This&lt; involves retrofitting diesel and dirty natural gas generators with clean&lt; natural gas technology. &lt; 5.   Elimination of the standby charges paid by distributed generation&lt; end-use customers to the Investor Owned Utilities. This includes small&lt; co-generation facilities and only applies to units that generate less than&lt; one megawatt. &lt; &lt; &lt; The Davis Administration will work closely with legislators to pass&lt; legislation to implement these proposals.&lt; &lt; Co-generation is the simultaneous generation of electricity and heat or&lt; steam, usually on an industrial site. Typically, the electricity is sold&lt; to the grid and the heat or steam is used onsite in the industrial process&lt; &lt; Distributed generation is a term used for a decentralized approach to&lt; generating electricity. Generally, the electricity is generated on the&lt; site where it is being used. It can include renewables (such as solar or&lt; wind power), fuel cells, and micro-generators.&lt; &lt; Governor Davis made his announcement at the UC Davis Medical Center&lt; Co-Generation Plant in Sacramento. The plant supplies not only all of the&lt; electricity for the but all of the heating and cooling, for the UC Davis&lt; Medical Center. It produces 26 MW of power. Since the Medical Center needs&lt; less than half of that, the excess power is sold back to the ISO, which&lt; pays the Center's utility bills.&lt; &lt; \"The UC Davis Medical Center Co-Generation Plant is a self-sufficient&lt; facility,\" Governor Davis added. \"It is an efficient facility. It is a&lt; clean facility. And it is the kind of facility that we need a lot more of&lt; to meet our peak energy demands.\"&lt; &lt; Governor Davis' energy plan relies on three elements: stabilization,&lt; conservation and generation. The Governor is working with legislative&lt; leadership on a stabilization plan for the State's Investor Owned&lt; Utilities. Over the last several weeks, Governor Davis unveiled an&lt; aggressive plan for energy conservation that will help reduce demand and&lt; keep costs down and a plan to dramatically increase the supply of produced&lt; and sold in California. &lt; &lt; &lt; ###&lt; &lt; \n"

If approved, this proposal could have catastrophic effects on surrounding control areas because it would transfer California's supply problems elsewhere, primarily to the Pacific Northwest.   The ISO's plan to hoard electricity violates the open access principles of Order 888 and could possibly cause a cascade of contract defaults if buyers in the Pacific Northwest do not receive power and are forced to cover in this volatile market. We can wait until the ISO files this plan with FERC at the end of the month, or we can get ahead of this important issue and ask FERC to rule on this before the ISO submits its report.   A preemptive strike presumes that   we can overcome any procedural hurdles inherent in challenging an unfiled proposal.   The ISO has cut some EPMI's real-time schedules over the past month or two, so perhaps we could get FERC to look at the curtailment issue in that context.Tim has asked that the legal/regulatory team make this a top priority.   Because of its importance he also wants to make sure that he and other traders are actively involved in preparing the FERC complaint.Background:   Today the ISO announced the details of its \"Market Stabilization Plan.\"   Although the plan may be DOA at FERC for several reasons, the ISO declared that under this plan it intends to require in-state generators to bid their full capacity into the proposed day-ahead market.   When questioned on the details of this, the ISO stated that, yes, it planned to curtail firm exports of energy from California during system shortages.   In other words, during shortages the ISO would cut the transmission schedules of in-state generators sending electricity out of California---even if those sales were \"firm,\" and even if those sales were under existing long-term contracts.The ISO argued that under its tariff it has the authority to cut schedules in emergency situations.   True.   But the reality is that the \"emergency\" is self-inflicted; by imposing price caps (another part of this Market Stabilization plan), the ISO is driving supply out of California.   As others have argued, the only \"emergency\" is price:   California has made a decision to keep consumer rates artificially low, and its use of price-controls has reduced the supply---causing a supply \"emergency\"---, and the ISO now seeks to increase its supply by building a one-way wall around the state of California.   Like the roach motel, megawatts check into California, but they don't check out.Steve\n"

Last Friday, this caused prices to increase at the Mid-Columbia (NW trading hub) by about $50-75, costing the NW wholesale market an estimated $2-5 million per day.   This transmission capacity is within the ISO's control and, because capacity is available, the ISO's actions seem to violate Order No. 888.   I also wonder what would happen if another control area decided they were going to take similar action.   This hurts Enron financially because we own FTRs and if there is no congestion, we don't get paid anything.   This is like \"economic\" force majeure.   The reason the ISO is listing zero ATC is that they're in a Stage 3 Emergency and they're not offering sufficient price/credit terms to get the power they need.   California obviously thinks its power needs are more important than the NW's. Issue 2 - We have transmission we are purchasing from some California munis using transmission facilities that are not part of the Cal ISO.   The ISO advised today that they are thinking about cutting exports from California.   We are concerned that the ISO will cut our transaction even though it uses transmission assets and rights that are not under the ISO's control.   If our deal were cut, it could cost us $20,000 to $1000,000 per hour (we have a 125 MW deal and spreads now are $125 and they would likely blow out more if exports were cut).   We hesitate to call the ISO and ask if they are going to cut us because we are afraid we might suggest something that they haven't thought of.   I'd be happy to answer any questions.   I'm at (503) 464-88862.\n"

In both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) transmission service and in both cases, the ATC was insufficient to award the entire request.   Transmission Providers, Ill. Power and SPP treated partial service differently.   In these orders FERC holds:A transmission provider (TP) is NOT required to offer short term service in response to a long term request.   Section 19.7 of the pro forma OATT only obligates the TP to tell the customer how much partial Long Term service could be provided.   Examples: --- Customer requests 3000 MW long term transmission service for one year.   TP replies that it can offer 2000 MW for the entire year. --- Customer requests 2 year service for 3000 MW.   TP replies that it can offer 3000 MW for one year. --- Customer requests 3000 MW for one year.   TP can only provide 3000 MW for summer months.   TP is NOT obligated to provide customer the 3 months   service.   Furthermore, an annual request for 3000 for some months and 0 MW for others is NOT a valid long term request.   What Customer is then doing is   really submitting a short term request for 3000 for summer only --- a new short term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission.While the TP is not required to respond with short term availability in response to a long term request, FERC did footnote to Ill. Power that it thinks it is a helpful idea for the TP to alert the customer to what ATC is available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes.\n"

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- California officials have shown \"bald disregard\" for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority and are pursuing short-sighted policies that will push the state's two largest utilities over the brink and into bankruptcy, FERC Chairman James Hoecker said Thursday. The remarks by Hoecker, who resigned as chairman effective Thursday, came in a highly unusual formal opinion in what represents his blistering last words on the rapidly unraveling power crisis in California.Hoecker lambasted Gov. Gray Davis and state policymakers for allowing the state's power crisis to finally succumb to rolling blackouts. State officials ignored the commission's Dec. 15 market-restructuring order and instead embraced \"conspiracy theories, resistance to more realistic rates, and calls for palliative price caps...to obscure the issues and delay solutions,\" Hoecker said. White House-brokered negotiations to develop power-supply contracts as part of a near-term solution are at an impasse due to \"unrealistic\" demands by Gov. Davis that power providers agree to contracts at rates below their cost of production, Hoecker said. He further called for Davis and lawmakers to relent in their unrealistic position that retail rates continue to be frozen at below-present-cost, pre-19996 levels. Unless state officials agree to pursue realistic policies, Edison International's Southern California Edison Co. (EIX) and PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. (PCG), will be pushed into bankruptcy by following the state's flawed market-restructuring law, Hoecker said. \"Perhaps bankruptcy can be averted. If it cannot, perhaps it will force debtors, creditors and state officials to address the financial problems of utilities in a new light, without recrimination and posturing,\" he said. \"Let's be realistic,\" Hoecker said. \"Wall Street and consumers share one critical trait: Without a reasonable, technically defensible and comprehensive set of solutions to such crises, they have no basis for confidence that problems can or will be managed or confidence to support investment on one hand and political forbearance on the other.\" Hoecker called for state officials to \"expeditiously\" implement the provisions of FERC's Dec. 15 order. In particular, he said, the California Power Exchange is making the financial situation worse by ignoring the order's provision calling for suspension of the single-price auction when prices bid exceed $150 per megawatt-hour. \"Prices above the level allowed in the Dec. 15 order (have) further jeopardized the financial status of California utilities,\" he said. Reaching a deal on forward contracts, as called for in FERC's order, is essential, Hoecker said. \"An arbitrary bottom-line solution cannot be prescribed without regard to costs,\" he said. But Hoecker reserved perhaps his harshest criticism for the state's first legislative response to the crisis, which Davis signed into law Thursday, to replace the California Independent System Operator's industry-participant governing board with a board of political state appointees. Such mixing of markets and politics on the ISO, a FERC-jurisdictional entity, represents \"an unacceptable intrusion...into federally regulated power markets,\" Hoecker said. Further, he said, FERC made \"mistakes\" in allowing AB 1890, the state's electricity restructuring law, to usurp the commission's regulatory authority over wholesale power markets in the first place. \"Because the state is now clearly a market participant, the independence of the (ISO) board is bound to be compromised. Consequently, the state's decisions are no longer entitled to the kind of deference we have accorded it since AB 1890,\" Hoecker said. \"More than that, this action evinces a bald disregard for federal jurisdiction and a rejection of cooperative solutions (called for in FERC's Dec. 15 restructuring order),\" Hoecker said. \"I recommend that the commission seek to enjoin this technically flawed and unlawful usurpation of its authority.\" Hoecker rejected the state's continuing call for firm price caps in the region. \"Price caps will only jeopardize reliability, mask problems temporarily, and deter or destroy any chance to solve the long-term supply challenge,\" he said. Hoecker urged an urgent response by policymakers, regardless of whether the utilities enter bankruptcy. \"We cannot...keep moving from one failure to the next, with no agreed-upon objectives. The governor's stated plans are unrealistic and ours' cannot be fully implemented without his help,\" Hoecker concluded. \"I urge state policymakers to reject the false illusion that going it alone will serve the interests of California consumers.\" -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-66647; bryan.lee@dowjones.com   Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

It would seem that if it is possible to ever become a   \"former\"   participant in the PX and not a \"current\" one, (\"current\" being   the word used in the tariff to describe who the chargebacks go to) that we would have had, at a minimum, to have given notice of termination of our participation in both the Core and CTS markets.   Please review this documentation and help us prepare for a possible extradited extraction from the PX.   Thanks.---cgy ---",

In addition to the letter to the CalPX, I am reasonably certain that a FERC filing is required to terminate the Participation Agreement because it is a power purchase/sale agreement, the form of which is on file with FERC.   Just to be safe I prepared the transmittal letter, notice of termination, and notice of filing necessary to file with FERC.

Therewould appear to be two salient points.1) CPUC asks for FERC to impose strict load-differentiated price caps. Thesewould be imposed using a formula based on \"margina1 heat rates\" times anindex gas price. So the maximum cap would be around $1000 and the minimumcould be quite low off-peak - more like $30-40/MWh. Needless to say thisdoes not recognize the opportunity costs of power in other markets. It wasalso completely make redundant any trading into California. The prices wouldrise immediately to the low caps, so there would be no incentive for anyoneto enter into any commerical hedging arrangements. The mechanism isbasically similar to the old SRAC QF contracts, but without the capacitypayments.2) CPUC asks that FERC require all jurisdictional generators AND marketersto offer forwards contracts for a substantial portion of their capacity atFERC regulated rates and conditionns for 18-36 months. They claim these arelike the UK and Australian \"vesting contracts\", but these involvedsignificant capacity or options payments as well. CPUC request that allgenerators and marketers should be instructed to begin preparation ofcost-based filings (how this would actually work is not stated).Needless to say the implementation of any of this would be wiping out themarket for up to three years, and eliminating any potential profits fromcurrent long positions in the market.The schemes they have proposed have numerous problems - even if theobjectives were desirable - so there is plenty to poke holes in. Thedecision on whether to file any response to me would seem to be based onwhether these issues will be completely addressed in FERC's order, makingthe CPUC Motion irrelevant. If there is any chance that the CPUC could betaken seriously their motion should be opposed, as the restrictions on themarket are quite onerous. Any players with long positions in the marketwould stand to lose quite a bit under the proposed capped rates at theselevels.SeabThis e-mail, and any attachments thereto, is intended only for use by theaddressee(s) named herein and may contain legally privileged and/orconfidential information.

In any given transaction this may be incorrect and therefore must be changed.   Specifically, a third person may in fact be responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission service from Sierra Pacific.   For example, the generator may sell the power to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the transmission service.   The eighth \"Whereas\" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2, E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.111.10, E.111.111, and E.12.) state the generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability Management System (RMS) Agreement.   I would like to point out that some generators do not like to commit to the \"good utility\" practice standard or to be bound by the RMS agreement.   Enron has signed the RMS Agreement.   I doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility practice standard.   This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to form, BPA must agree to join.   Enron is very interested in RTO West forming.   If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable alternative standard.Section 1.1   Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become effective.   This is not the way the OATT operates.   Rather, if Enron and Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's open access tariff.   Service here is governed by the transmission open access tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT applies.   The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and therefor 2111) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the customer simply requests service under the OATT.   Requiring the customer to wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would completely   undermine the purpose of Order No. 888.Section 1.2 After, \"by both parties\" add \"however, if the parties cannot agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT.\"Section 1.6.2   Three years advance written notice is too long.   A reasonable notice period would be ___.Section 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 EPMI opposes the definitions of \"Applicable Laws\" \"Applicable Permits\" and \"Applicable Reliability Criteria\" because, when combined with their use throughout the contract (in Sections 2.6, 3.5, 3.10, 3.111, 5.6.2, 5.6.3, 8.4.2, 111.8, E.2.8, E.3.3, E.4.1, E.4.3, E.4.4, and E.9.5) they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to amendment of the contract by government action.   Section 2.19 Section (i) of the definition of \"Dispatch gives Sierra too much control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for \"the most reliable\" supply.   Change \"the most reliable\" to \"a reliable\"Section 2.31 Is inconsistent with Sierra's OATT.   It should be written using the same words as the OATT.Section 2.52   The reference to Section 222.1 should be corrected to 21.1.Section 2.56 Definition of \"System Integrity\" is too broad.   When combined with Section 3.13.2, it would require our generator to not \"have an adverse impact on \"maximiz[ing] the health, welfare, safety of personnel and the general public.\"   While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities, there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we should not.Section 3.5 The proposed Use of \"System Integrity\" here is more fair assuming EPMI agrees to the \"Good Utility Practice\" standard.Section 3.7 Shouldn't the word \"unplanned\" be added before the word Outages?Section 3.8 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others.Section 3.10 The second sentence exposes EPMI   to regulatory risk by allowing Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI.   This risk is increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for such facilities in its sole discretion.   Editorial note: the third to last sentence is missing a period.Section 3.13.2 See comments under Section 2.56.Section 4.1 EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of service already provided by this contract.   Accordingly, the words \"or ordered by FERC\" should be deleted.   EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra, with FERC's approval, to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for operation of Sierra's facilitiesSection 4.3 Should the words \"generating company's applicable FERC-approved tariff\" be changed to \"Applicable Law?\"Section 5.1.1 EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not increase by more than 10 percent.   Under FERC's precedent, EPMI is only required to pay actual cost.Section 5.1.3 Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a final invoice.The words \"plus Interest\" should be added after the words \"difference\" in the fourth sentence.Section 5.6.2 This section says essentially the same thing as Section 3.10 and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons.Section 6.4.3 Add period at end of sentence.Section 7.1 Delete period after the word \"and\" in last sentence.Section 8.1.4 Add period after \"Interconnection Facilities.\"Section 8.4.2 EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third parties.Section 8.7.2 Delete the word \"and\" on the seventh line. Section 9.1.1 See comments under Sections 2.56.Section 111.7 Delete \"pen-nits\" from last line on page and insert \"permits.\"Section 111.8   After \"remediation or abatement activity\" insert \"pay all fines, penalties, or compensations as required by law.\"Section 13.4 There should be a reciprocal provision for generators.Section 16.2 EPMI opposes \"regulatory\" Force Majeure.   Section 16.6 This provision is too broad in that it allows the System Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI.Section 17.9 Add the letter \"y\" after \"and ma\" on the second line.Section 19.2.1 Third to last line change \"ahs\" to \"has.\"Section 19.3 Needs to be edited.Section 19.6 This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTO's requirements.   Section 222.5 By law, System Operator should be required to file with FERC prior to terminating the connection.Section 31.8   This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of the interconnection contract.   This is standard in utility tariffs and agreements and in fact is in the FERC's pro forma OATT under Order No. 888.   Section 31.9 of the contract retains EPMI's rights to protest any unilateral filing by Sierra under Section 31.8 and seems to balance the rights given to Sierra in Section 31.8 by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any of the rates, terms, or conditions, etc., of the interconnection agreement.Exhibit D D.1.1 EPMI should not be required to provide free station service to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties.   A higher level of service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather at the agreement of the Parties.   D.1.2 The phrase \"Except under Applicable Law,\" should be added before the first sentence.D.2 EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level determined by Sierra's discretion.   Accordingly, EPMI opposes this entire provision.   If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs, EPMI would agree to provide ___ level of VArs at ___ rate.   EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at Sierra's discretion, subject to this rate, in the case of an Emergency.   Otherwise, EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power (instead of VArs) to the market at a market-based rate, and it might be subject to having such transactions cut at Sierra's \"discretion\" without being assured the cost of cover.   Accordingly, the rate standard of cost or foregone revenues would not be compensatory.D.3 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service.D.4 Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission service, it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service including regulation and frequency response service of real-time load -following service.   Accordingly, this provision should be deleted.D.5 EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be deleted.   Sierra should get ancillary services from the market.E.2 Change \"minimized\" to \"minimize.\"E.2.4 Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator \"may affect System Integrity.\"E.4.1.3 EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to \"approve\" Planned Outage Schedules.E.4.4 Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term \"System Integrity\" here as too high as standard.E.6.5 The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority to preclude Planned Outages.E.7.1 Add the word \"the\" on line 4 after \"at.\"E.8.1 EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area Operator authorization to undertake any action that is \"reasonably likely to have an adverse impact of System Integrity,\" especially adjustment of the amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system under E.8.1.1.E.8.2.2 Because VArs could be sold as real power, System Control should not be allowed to \"establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules.\"   Rather, Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage support it requires.   See also E.8.9 establishing power factors.E.8.4 EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra.   We need to negotiate compensation.E.8.6 Giving Sierra \"sole discretion\" to determine \"unacceptable deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System\" is too broad.E.9.2 \"Repots\" should be \"reports\"\n"

[IMAGE]IssueAlert for   March 5, 20001 PGOCorp. Receives $1 Billion To Partially Pay Off Debtsby Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry AnalysisPGOCorp., parent of nearly bankrupt utility PGOCo., announced that it has closed a $1 billion loan agreement that will allow it to pay various debts including its defaulted fourth quarter dividend to shareholders. The loans, provided by GE Capital Structured Finance Group and Lehman Brothers, will be secured by the company's equity interest in PGONational Energy Group LLC.   Analysis: Although this may seem like a positive step for the troubled utility, PGOCo.'s partial payment pales in comparison to its outstanding debt. Making matters even worse for the company is a new wave of lawsuits seeking restitution in the amount of $3 billion. The loans, which PGOCorp. was able to secure due to the strong performance of its National Energy Group subsidiary, have enabled the corporation to \"pay its outstanding debt obligations on which it has defaulted or would default in the near future.\" The obligations that have been paid include: $501 million in payments to commercial paper holders, $434 million in borrowings under a revolving credit agreement, and $1116 million owned to PGOCorporation common shareholders for the defaulted 4Q 2000 dividend. The loan, which has a term of two years, includes an option that, \"depending on certain factors,\" would give the lenders between 2 and 3 percent of the shares in National Energy Group. In addition, the loan agreement prohibits PGOfrom declaring or paying future common stock dividends until the loans are repaid.   In an effort to conserve cash and stave off bankruptcy, on Jan. 10 PGOCorp. halted payment of its fourth quarter dividend, which had been declared on Oct. 18, 2000, and was due to be payable on Jan. 15. Soon after that, the company announced that it would not be able to make certain payments on commercial paper obligations. Citing that the risk of bankruptcy played a factor in assuming the loan, PGOCorp. CEO and President Robert Glynn said that the financing would be repaid with PGOCorp. shareholder dollars only. In other words, Glynn reassured customers of the utility that rates would not be increased as a mechanism to repay this loan. However, PGOcontinues its negotiations with Calif. Gov. Gray Davis to increase rates for at least a substantial part of losses already accrued due to skyrocketing prices in the wholesale market. Reportedly, as of Dec. 31, PGOhad racked up more than $6 billion in undercollected costs.   In its 8K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, PGOCorp. acknowledged that it would be damaged further if the California Public Utilities Commission adopts current power payment proposals without an electric rate increase. Meanwhile, a pending deal between PGOand Gov. Davis is expected to include the sale of the utility's transmission assets to the state of California, much like PG&amp;E's counterpart Southern California Edison (SCE) has already done.   The bottom line of the loans is that PGOis \"removed from being in default on its credit agreements,\" according to Greg Pruett, vice president of corporate communications in an interview with CBS.MarketWatch.com. Pruett also said that the loans amounted to \"one less item of significance\" that the holding company has to attend to ensure it doesn't find itself \"in a situation where it could have creditors seeking to force it into bankruptcy.\" However, as noted, just as PGOCorp. received this loan, the parent company and the utility announced that they have been hit with two lawsuits seeking a total of nearly $3 billion in restitution. PGOCorp. and PGOCo., on the basis of the newly secured loan, say that they can only make partial payments of $1 billion. Both lawsuits were filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on Feb. 13. According to CBSMarketWatch.com, one lawsuit alleges that PGOCorp. violated its fiduciary duties by repurchasing common share of its PGOCo. unit at a price of $2.3 billion. The second lawsuit claims that PGOCorp. collected nearly $2.96 billion from PGOCo. under a tax-sharing arrangement, but paid only $2.29 billion to all governments under the arrangement. The plaintiff in both suits is identified only as Richard D. Wilson, who seeks to enjoin any more such buybacks unless \"good cause\" is shown, and also seeks restitution of $2.3 billion, with interest, from PGOCorp. The parent company and utility have discounted the validity of the lawsuits, although they said they were unable to predict any outcome or how it might their financial conditions. In its most recent filing with the SEC, PGOalso disclosed that the utility unit owes $1.1 billion to the California Independent System Operator for December energy purchases, and another $3331 million to a group of unidentified power generators for January deliveries. At that time, which was only a few days before PGOCorp. secured the loans, the company said it could only make partial payments of these debts on a pro rata basis. As a result, PGOCorp said it could only pay the California ISO about $1777 million, and make payments of $51 million to the power suppliers. It appears that PGOCorp. has not used any of the funds secured in its loans to make additional payments to the California ISO or power suppliers. As noted, PG&amp;E's subsidiary National Energy Group played a prominent role in its parent's loans. The loans will be secured by the company's equity interest in National Energy Group, and the lenders could potentially gain a 2 or 3 percent interest in the subsidiary. National Energy Group is PGOCorp.'s unregulated power producer that sells energy on the East Coast, primarily in New England. PGOCorp. has previously claimed that its goal is for National Energy Group to be in a position to contribute 30 percent of earnings for the parent company by 20002. While the regulated PGOCo. continues to struggle in debt, National Energy Group has been quite successful. In fact, much of PGOCorp.'s earnings over 2000 came directly from National Energy Group, which gained a 2333-percent profit increase in 2Q 2000 and an 222-percent profit increase in 3Q 2000. Clearly, PGOCorp. has benefited greatly from National Energy Group's ability, as an unregulated subsidiary, to sell power outside in deregulated markets outside of California. Thus, it is no wonder that, although PGOCorp. still considers California to be an attractive market, the core driver of its strategy is NEG, which is able to operate in all lucrative markets as they become deregulated. Just last month, PGOCorp. gained approval to implement a shrewd restructuring of its business units that protects National Energy Group (and other high-profit subsidiaries) from any impact that the bankruptcy of the regulated utility or parent company might cause. In other words, if PGOCorp. and PGOCo. ultimately declare bankruptcy, subsidiaries such as National Energy Group would not bear any foreseeable impact, protecting some of PG&amp;E's most profitable business units from financial insolvency. Ironically, however, through this loan there is now a tie between the unregulated business of National Energy Group and the regulated PGOCo., although the ramifications of this connection are not completely clear at this time.   Moreover, while the loan that PGOhas secured certainly helps, it by no means brings an end to the utility's financial problems. Through the loan, PGOhas been enabled to pay outstanding debt obligations on which it has already defaulted or may default on in the near future. However, the payments made in the amount of $1 billion only reflect a small percentage of PG&amp;E's reported $6 billion of total debt. Thus, bankruptcy is still a strong possibility for the company unless some other new major development occurs. Most likely, this development will be the sale of its transmission system to the state. PGOmay have to lower its expectations of what it believes its system to be worth (reportedly $1 billion). However, just as SCE has now been apparently protected from bankruptcy filing due to the sale of its own transmission system, PGOmay also find that an asset sale is its only recourse at this juncture.

The CVP data are a helpful index of California hydro conditions, but only represent about 10% of the state's installed hydro capacity.Please forward this information to appropriate FERC staff. \n"

If you need additional materials, just let me know.In addition, EPSA sent some questions they would like the Senator to ask of any of the EPSA witnesses (Reliant, Calpine, Williams, or Enron) dealing with the Impact of the Recent changes in the Management of the California Independent System Operator:Background:   The Cal ISO acts as the \"air traffic controller\" for the interstate electric power grid in California.   The ISO determines who gets access to the grid and under what terms and conditions.   It is the ISO that helps ensure that access to the grid is truly open and non-discriminatory.   When the ISO was initially constituted several years ago, a \"stakeholder\" management board was created that represented a wide range of market interests---power sellers, generators, consumers, political leaders, etc.   After the power emergencies began last summer, this board was criticized as too splintered and indecisive.   In a response to this perception and in an effort to impose greater control over the ISO, the California state legislature replaced the stakeholder board with a five-person board that serves at the request of the California Governor.QUESTION:   The Cal ISO has recently seen its management board changed from one with broad stakeholder representation to one appointed by the California Governor.   Given that California is a critical part of a larger western regional power market, how can we ensure that regional power needs are reflected in the decisions of the new state appointed Board?ANSWER:   We really can't.   Most of the time, the Board has a limited role.   However, the \"traffic controller\" role becomes crucial when the power crunch comes.   Every market participant needs to be worried that, during times of real power emergencies, the Cal ISO Board will be too willing to shoot first and ask questions later.   Companies with firm transactions involving out-of-state entities may find their needs and commercial interests sacrificed to prevent local political problems.   Instead of robust, competitive regional markets, politicizing transmission decisions practically guarantees an increasingly balkanized market.\n"

This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unitvery broad authority to request information, specifically: \"the submissionof any infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to bepotentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whoseactivies may affect the operation of the ISO market.\"Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.

We reviewed the FERC Order and concludedthat the FERC had imposed no such obligation.   We decided to do nothingrather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could bequoted out-of-context in the newspaper.   Moreover, it's my understandingthat we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO hascorrectly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcementactions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions abovethe price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).   I coulddo one of several things for you at this point:   Stay quiet   Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)   Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and   will not report unless and until we do   Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back   Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSAI am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the\"Dirty 13\" list) and we'll end up in the press again.   To lay low, I'minclined to pursue options 3 or 4.   What do others think?   Traders - pleaseverify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.(See attached file: Letter to Eric Hilderbrandt.doc)---",

Is it also affecting CA's ability to return power to BPA pursuant tothe one-for-two exchange agreement?

It can (1) buy more power(under its DOE granted Section 202&amp;copy; authority), (2) cut scheduled powertransactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power fromits system.   The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmissioncapacity to the Northwest (option 3).   Because transmission users can't getcapacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISOgets cheaper power over customers in the NW.I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.   I waswondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?)to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might evenget Steve Wright to sign on given that this   situation must make it moredifficult for him to balance his budget.The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry therewould be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simplytrying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.   It could alsopoint out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary ofEnergy's Section 202&amp;copy; orders to get the power it needs for an emergencyand that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to havea just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for thepower.   I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled powertransactions.   I don't think we want to encourage that.What do you think?   Call me.\n"

This fact was verified to me by our ISO customer contact on Friday.   Although we do not have the E-mails anymore, the ISO sends our traders E-mails everyday about the ATC on the ties, so this information is verifiable with the ISO.   Our customer contact didn't know exactly what day it had started and I have not wanted to pursue this more with the ISO, not knowing whether we wanted our identity divulged.   The reason for the zero rating is that the ISO is in a Stage 3 emergency.   The line was again rated at zero today.   I have been pursuing the following approaches to getting this issue investigated and resolved.   I've talked to Scott Miller at FERC and to Eric Thode in Houston.

I have also prepared a short note to describe the pricing provisions of the Transmission Operating Agreement which trigger the transfer payments.   The spreadsheet has notes which explain the process.   It also assumes that a volumetric export fee is not added.

IPALCO common stock was=20\rsuspended from trading at the close of the market on March 27. =20\r Analysis: The purchase of IPALCO, an established and respected utility in t=\rhe=20\rMidwest, will help AES to continue to secure its foothold in this region an=\rd=20\rfurther the company's aggressive expansion efforts along the generation sid=\re=20\rof its business. AES already owns CILCORP, an energy services company whose=\r=20\rlargest subsidiary, CILCO, serves portions of Illinois and Missouri. (Note=\r=20\rthat pursuant to an SEC order, AES will restructure and/or sell its ownersh=\rip=20\rinterests in CILCORP within two years in order to retain its status as an=\r=20\rexempt holding company under PUHCA). Thus, through the purchase of IPALCO,=\r=20\rAES is strengthening a presence in the Midwest that it already has=20\restablished. In addition, from this purchase we now know that AES, along wi=\rth=20\rbeing a global player, intends to remain dominant throughout the United=20\rStates as well. Further, the acquisition represents a rather bright=20\rdevelopment for AES, considering that the company has recently encountered=\r=20\rsome ongoing challenges related to its operations in California.=20\r First, let's examine the value of AES' acquisition of IPALCO. Certainly, th=\re=20\r3,000 MW of generation that AES gained in the deal must have been the prima=\rry=20\rdraw, but from comments made by Dennis Bakke, AES president and CEO, the=20\rcompany apparently also wants to become a marketing presence in Indiana (an=\rd=20\rthe Midwest as a whole). IPALCO gains in the deal by now being under the=20\raggressive management of AES; the subsidiaries under IPALCO such as=20\rIndianapolis Power &amp; Light will now stand a much better chance for global=\r=20\rdevelopment and expansion.=20\r As with other generation acquisitions that AES has made, the company secure=\rs=20\ra decided edge over competitors that may have strong marketing presence but=\r=20\rfewer hard assets. With its strong generation portfolio, to which the IPALC=\rO=20\rpurchase only adds, AES can further guarantee to potential customers a=20\rreliable power supply. AES is one of the largest generation companies in th=\re=20\rworld, having reached this level through a series of strategic acquisitions=\r.=20\rThe company's generating assets include interests in 134 facilities totalin=\rg=20\rover 48 gigawatts of capacity. By comparison, Calpine has approximately=20\r36,7000 MW, Dynegy has a net ownership of 12,497 MW, and Reliant has about=\r=20\r27,000 MW. In addition, AES' electricity distribution network has over=20\r920,000 km of conductor and associated rights of way, and sells over 126,000=\r0=20\rGWh per year to over 17 million end-user customers. =20\r AES has surpassed many of its power supply competitors by maintaining an=20\raggressive growth strategy over the past year. Recent milestones for the=20\rcompany are too many to list here. However, highlights include acquiring a=\r=20\rcontrolling interest in Electricidad de Caracas; acquiring 1000-percent=20\rinterest in Tractebel Power; purchasing 70-percent interest in the Mohave=\r=20\rGenerating Station in Laughlin, Nev.; and purchasing GeoUtilities, Inc., an=\r=20\rInternet-based superstore for energy and telecom services. Just since the=\r=20\rstart of 20001, AES entered into an agreement to purchase all of the energy=\r=20\rassets of Thermo Ecotec Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo=20\rElectron Corporation of Waltham, Mass., for $195 million, and announced new=\r=20\rgeneration development projects in Texas and California. AES also has=20\rcontinued its international expansion with an acquisition of a 140-MW=20\roil-fired co-generation facility in Italy, the acquisition of a 290-MW=20\rbarge-mounted natural-gas fired generating business in Nigeria, and the=20\rpurchase of additional ownership interest in a 1,000-MW hydro plant in=20\rArgentina. =20\r As I've said in the past, AES is a company to watch. Even when acquisitions=\r=20\rthat AES is making seem rather small, they must be taken within the context=\r=20\rof the portfolio that AES is building. Whether it's generation, retail=20\rmarketing, telecom, or selling electricity over the Internet, AES has a=20\rfoothold in many different areas. AES is a major player that can offer the=\r=20\rfull package to a customer, which may in the end be its strongest advantage=\r.=20\rThe company maintains that it is engaged in three lines of businesses, whic=\rh=20\rare all equally important to its strategy: power generation, network delive=\rry=20\rservices and retail energy marketing. However, it is important to recognize=\r=20\rthat AES continues to build a huge generation arsenal and now has the=20\rcapability to market its commodity products through its marketing=20\rsubsidiaries.=20\r However, although AES has had a fairly successful year, the company has hit=\r=20\rsome bumps and made some questionable decisions along the way, all of which=\r=20\rwere related to the California market. AES has established several tolling=\r=20\ragreements with Williams Corp. for the power plants that AES owns in=20\rCalifornia. Under the tolling agreements, AES essentially rents its plants =\rto=20\rWilliams so that Williams can generate fuel to electricity, which it then c=\ran=20\rsell on the wholesale market. In other words, Williams had a contract to=20\rmarket all of the power generated by AES' California plants. In hindsight,=\r=20\rAES may regret the questionable decision to enter into the tolling agreemen=\rts=20\rwith Williams in California. Although AES did well last year, with net inco=\rme=20\rrising 181 percent to $641 million, the company reportedly lost $111 million=\r=20\ron the lucrative California market. Meanwhile, Williams (NYSE: WMB) reporte=\rd=20\runaudited 2000 income from continuing operations of $873.2 million, or $1.9=\r5=20\rper share on a diluted basis, versus $178 million, or 40 cents per share on=\r a=20\rrestated basis, for 1999. AES also took a hit when it had to pay air=20\rpollution fines and buy power on the wholesale market to meet its obligatio=\rns=20\rto Williams when it was forced to shut some plants down. =20\r Further, AES (along with other companies) continues to fall under the inten=\rse=20\rscrutiny of FERC for pricing that the commission has deemed \"unjust and=20\runreasonable\" for power generated at AES-owned plants. FERC's investigation=\r=20\rcenters on the unavailability of certain so-called \"must run\" generating=20\rplants in the Los Angeles area that are owned by AES Southland, a subsidiar=\ry=20\rof AES. A \"must run\" plant is a generating facility that the California ISO=\r=20\rcan call upon to provide energy and ancillary service essential to the=20\rreliability of the California transmission network. Several weeks ago, FERC=\r=20\rannounced that a preliminary investigation raised serious questions about t=\rhe=20\ractions of Williams Energy Marketing and Trading and AES.   =20\r On March 14, FERC gave the two companies 20 days to explain why they should=\r=20\rnot refund $10.86 million to California utilities. Further, FERC said that=\r=20\r\"Williams had a financial incentive to prolong any outages\" of two AES-owne=\rd=20\rplants last April and May. \"Williams received more revenues as a result of=\r=20\rthe respective outages,\" the commission said. AES responded to the charges =\rby=20\rsaying that the plants were taken off line for repairs and that it did not=\r=20\rshare in market revenues from sales of power from the plants. According to =\ra=20\rreport in The Washington Post, AES Pacific Group vice president Stu Ryan sa=\rid=20\rthat as long as the plants are in operating condition, Williams decides whe=\rn=20\rthey will run and what it will charge for their power. =20\r As a result of the unavailability of the two \"must run\" AES plants, the=20\rstate's ISO had to obtain power from other plants, also owned by AES, where=\r=20\rthe power was much more expensive and the companies made much larger=20\rprofits.   The commission said its investigation indicated that AES and=20\rWilliams refused to make the two \"must run\" plants available \"for reasons=\r=20\rthat were not directly related to the necessary and timely maintenance\" of=\r=20\rthe plant. =20\r Many power supply companies that were active in the California wholesale=20\rmarket now are retreating due to the volatility and uncertainty of the=20\rstate's market. Although it remains unclear how AES will continue to=20\rparticipate in the California market, it may be a smart move for the compan=\ry=20\rto focus on expanding operations in other regions of the United States (suc=\rh=20\ras the Midwest). Yet, how AES' acquisition of IPALCO will impact the=20\rcompany's bottom line remains to be seen. Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) is=20\rreserving its assessment of the partnership for the time being, and is=20\rkeeping AES on CreditWatch. AES' double-'B' corporate credit, single-'B'-pl=\rus=20\rrating on subordinated debt, and single-'B' rating on the company's trust=\r=20\rpreferred securities remain intact pending further review and information=\r=20\rabout the acquisition of IPALCO. Also, S=02?lowered its corporate credit ra=\rtings=20\ron IPALCO to triple-'B' from single-'A'-plus, and IPALCO's subsidiary,=20\rIndianapolis Power &amp; Light Co. (IPL), to triple-'B' from double-'A'-minus,=\r=20\rand revised the CreditWatch implications to positive from negative. S=02?ex=\rpects=20\rto address the CreditWatch status in the next two weeks. =20\r On March 27, AES shares closed at about $47.75. As of mid-morning on March=\r=20\r28, AES shares were priced at about $50.000. Over the last few days, AES=20\rshares have increased by about 5 percent and have closely tracked the Dow=\r=20\rJones Utility Average.=20\r An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at\rww.ConsultRCI.com\r   Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day.

We are considering filing areply, and I wanted to get your input.   Generally, DENA does not like tofile answers to answers as it is in FERC's discretion whether to acceptsuch responses, but we may want to consider clarifying our positionregarding the monthly direct assignment charges under Article 12 of the IA.Please let me know your take.Best Regards,Teresa Brown(713) 627-6592We've taken a look at the answer Arizona Public Service Company filed on12/222/000 in response to our protest.   There are a number of issues to whichDENA should consider responding.   Responses must be filed by Monday,January8, 20001.*   Study assumptions (APS Answer, at 8-9):   APS argues that there is nobenefit from disclosing assumptions and that this would give a generator anunfair market advantage over other market participants.   While APS does notindicate to whom there is no benefit, presumably it means APS.   We shouldconsider challenging this since there is a benefit to disclosure of thestudy assumptions --- how else is a generator to determine whether it isbeing asked to goldplate APS' system?   APS' answer to this is to say thatthe IA's Willful Action provisions prevent APS from conducting activitiesormaking decisions based on motive to serve financial benefit.   We are at aloss, however, as to how the provisions accomplish that since what theyreally do is shield APS from liability.I agree --- and agree that APS' responsedoesn't make sense.   I believe that the Commission hasrequired Entergy to provide more study data to a generator in one of last year'scomplaints against Entergy (either Dynegy or NRG?).***What about a response on the \"must -run\" issue (p. 27-28).   I think APS is trying to back door the Arizona proposed requirements (that are still being fought and arenot accepted?)   This is a big issue and APS' response does not address our arguments otherthan stating that Must Run should be required in the IA.   I do notknow of any other interconnection agreements that have must-run provisions.*   Transmission credits (APS Answer, at 30-31):   APS claims thattransmission credits are appropriate only for firm service, a propositionthe Commission just rejected in the ComEd order issued on 12/8/000.Absolutely agree that itshould be for firm and non-firm.*   Monthly Direct Assignment Charges (APS Answer, at 32-333):   We shouldconsider clarifying our position on this issue, which APS appears tomisunderstand. APS argues that, in our protest, we addressed the cost ofmodifications, not the cost of operation and maintenance, and thus werecomparing apples to oranges.   This is not true.   Rather, what we argued isthat we should not be responsible for the cost of operating and maintainingany facilities for which we were not responsible for the initialinstallation cost.   APS apparently missed the point.I agree.*   Willful Action (APS Answer, at 333-37):   APS essentially argues thatthe strict liability provisions in the IA are appropriate because it cannotmake a profit by entering into an IA.   Unlike with respect to transmissionservice, it recovers only its actual costs.   APS   ignores the fact that, byinterconnecting a generator, APS will ultimately generate transmissionrevenue.   APS also ignores the benefits that new generation bring to thetable.   APS has not justified why the liability provisions are \"consistentwith, or superior to\" the pro forma tariff and why a generator should berequired to bear the consequences of APS' negligence and, in manyinstances,intentional misconduct, particularly where APS is not provided anyincentiveto act prudently, simply because APS receives no profit.I agree.   APS' proposed restrictionsare wholly unwarranted and are outrageous.   There are no other interconnection agreements(that I know of) containing anything remotely similar.Please let us know how you'd like to proceed.   If you have any questions,let us know.   Thanks.Gretchen\n"

      "body": "\nAs I indicated to Jeff Golden yesterday, the problem with siting a project in APS is that it typically doesn't have any long term transmission because, in June through October, it is using the transmission to serve its native load, even to the point of selling Palo Verde and buying Four Corners uneconomically.   Accordingly, our short term traders perceive that APS sells transmission aggressively while our mid-marketers think that APS is the hardest utility to buy transmission from in the Southwest.   If you could figure out some way to sell to the market during the winter and sell to APS in the Summer it seems like that would be a good bet.   However, I would wait to talk to APS' merchant function before you submit any transmission requests to APS'   transmission function given that the traders question whether APS may try to discriminate in favor of its merchant function.   Depending on what APS' tariff says, you may have to request interconnection on-line and you have to request transmission on-line.   I will help you do this when you're ready.I have tried to check APS' OASIS for two days in a row to find out if they have transmission for the project, but the cite was down.   I'll check again today.From: James D Steffes@ENRON on 03/01/20001 08:24 PM CSTTo: chris calger, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Leslie Lawner/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: APS and EnronDoes anyone have any issues or ideas on how EES can best   work with APS?Jim---"

If we are, we should have the same third party review language (with my revision) as in the FS Agreement.Karen E Jones02/06/20001 10:31 AMTo: David Leboe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Dean Russell/SF/ECT@ECT Subject: Antelope Valley - SCE System Impact and Tie-Line Impact StudiesI'm following up on my email to you of 2/1 (attached below).David, it's my understanding from our call last week that we do not have a balance sheet or other accounting issue involved with these studies so long as we are not committing to any construction or other hard costs.   I've reviewed the agreements and confirmed that the only commitment being made by Antelope Valley Energy Facility, LLC, our project company   (\"AVEF\") is to pay $50,000 as the cost of each study (which amount can't be increased unless AVEF agrees).   So it seems we are ok from an accounting standpoint - correct?   Please also confirm from an accounting standpoint that it is still acceptable, as we did with the initial Facilities Study Agreement with SCE for the project, that AVEF be the contract party with SCE.Mary, do you have any comments or concerns from a regulatory standpoint?The commercial team needs to sign both these agreements and submit them back to SCE this week, so please get back to me or Dean as soon as you can.Thanks,Karen---"

This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit very broad authority to request information, specifically: \"the submission of any infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose activies may affect the operation of the ISO market.\"   Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.   The FERC did not order us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now requesting it.   I think our only available approach is to provide the information to the ISO pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.   I have asked Sue Mara if she would contact WPTF about negotiating a confidentiality agreement.   Richard, please advise if this is the proper course of action.

We reviewed the FERC Order and concludedthat the FERC had imposed no such obligation.   We decided to do nothingrather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could bequoted out-of-context in the newspaper.   Moreover, it's my understandingthat we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO hascorrectly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcementactions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions abovethe price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).   I coulddo one of several things for you at this point:   Stay quiet   Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)   Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and   will not report unless and until we do   Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back   Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSAI am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the\"Dirty 13\" list) and we'll end up in the press again.   To lay low, I'minclined to pursue options 3 or 4.   What do others think?   Traders - pleaseverify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.(See attached file: Letter to Eric Hilderbrandt.doc)---"

The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.   Inpreparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following SchedulingProcedure to help assure a smooth transition.   The Scheduling Procedure isthe same one used in 2000.   CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings TimeTransition   The following is a brief explanation of how SC's shouldprepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI)system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on4/1/01.   When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules forTrade Date 4/1/01, which is considered a \"Short\" day because an hour islost, SC's should   schedule all 24 hours of information with the data forHE03 being zeroed out in the template or blanked out when using the CAISO SIWeb Workspace to submit schedules.   The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write datafrom/to the SI database for the \"Short\" day's HE03.   Therefore, no data willbe sent to settlements for this hour.   Consequently, settlements will haveonly 23 records for this \"Short\" day, Trade Date 4/1/01.   If you have additional Scheduling questions for this tradedate, please contact Ginger Seitles, ISO Market Operations, @ (916)351-44420.   CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings TimeTransition   The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) inPST, year around.   Therefore, the transition to DST should require nomodification to meter data submission.   However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter datacontinues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.   If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this tradedate, please contact   ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-44431. For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.

Please let Sue o=\rr=20\rI know if you believe we should intervene/protest.\r   Alan Comnes\r Summary of ISO Amendment 34:\r Filed: December 28\r Effective Date: 1/1/01 (expedited treatment requested)\r Protests Due: January 17? (need to confirm this)\r Filing in a Nutshell: The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is t=\ro=20\rclarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmissi=\ron=20\rAccess Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No. 27.=20\r(According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended=\r,=20\rand set for hearing.   Settlement negotiations are ongoing.   (Is Enron a par=\rty=20\rto these settlements?))) In addition, the ISO provides new transmission Acce=\rss=20\rCharge (TAC) rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the Ci=\rty=20\rof Vernon joining the ISO effective January 1, 20001 and the amount of Firm=\r=20\rTransmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO=\r=20\rTariff.\r Specific Proposed Changes\r Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity\r The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the=\r=20\rdetermination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to u=\rse=20\rtransmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances. =20\rEncumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing=20\rcontracts.   This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and th=\re=20\rISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method.\r New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO=01,s Proposed Transmission Methodo=\rlogy\r The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates=\r=20\rbased on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating=\r=20\rTO.   Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they=\r=20\rare known as =01&amp;license plate=018 rates.   Under Amendment No. 27, this met=\rhodology=20\rcontinues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO.   Once that=\r=20\roccurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be=\r=20\rassessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requiremen=\rts=20\rof all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area.\r The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula where=\rin=20\rnew members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and syst=\rem=20\raverage embedded costs.   The goal is that after 10 years there will be only=\r 1=20\rhigh voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the curren=\rt=20\rmethod, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charge=\rs,=20\rPG&amp;E and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately $3.2 million and=20\rVernon would be subsidized approximately $7 million.\r Calculation of the net (benefits)/burdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact=\r. =20\r PG&amp;E and SCE have a $32 Million cap annually and=20\rSDG&amp;E has a $8 Million cap annually; Vernon is held harmless; I\rOUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the tota=\rl=20\rcap.=09Adjusted\r=09Net\r=09(Benefit)/\r=09Burden\r=09($1000)\r=09[37]\rPG&amp;E=09$3,283=20\rSCE=09$3,283=20\rSDG&amp;E=09$821=20\rVernon=09($7,051)\r   Total=09$3336=20\r=09\r=09\r=09Note: a positive number means the TAC is going up.

All the parties except PGE/Sierra/Nevada agreed to eliminate the export fees.   PGE/Sierra/Nevada made a joint filing asking the FERC to require the RTO West to include export fees and their effect in the financial modeling of their Stage 2 filing.   I think we should consider filing comments   to oppose this requiest from PGE/Sierra/Nevada for the following reasons:Elimination of the export fees is a positive step to resolve one of the three major \"seams\" issues.   With RTO West taking the lead, the other RTOs (CAISO &amp; DSTAR) can follow suit.The nature and type of export fee to be used would have to be developed.   This eat up an enormous amount of time on a speculative fee which the majority of the parties are opposed to including.   The delay engendered and use of limited resources is unconsiounable.We can reiterate our concerns regarding allocation of rights instead of an auction and about the potential exclusion of facilities from the RTO West control.   The December 1st filing really doesn't change those things.   Since the comments are due on the 16th and I will be gone all next week, I thought I had better let you know my views before leaving.I am including the IPP/Marketers comments for reference.Steve\n"

As an initial caveat, we have prepared this as the scrivener for the Group.   Like the rest of the Group, we have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we expect the rest of the Group will.   In addition, we have the following comments:1.   In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action.   It seems to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve the charge-back issues.   Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to address this issue in the response.   The Group may want to consider approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.2.   Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 222 proceeding as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief.   We have tried to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete relief as part of the Debtor's motion.   If the Debtor objects to the expanded relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically the subject of the motion.

HUFF\" &lt;EHUFF@LLGM.COM&lt; 03/20 4:59 PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Attached you will find the draft of the Response of the Group to the Motion for Relief from Stay filed by the Debtor.   As an initial caveat, we have prepared this as the scrivener for the Group.   Like the rest of the Group, we have not specifically reviewed the substance of this with our client and we reserve the right to suggest changes based on our client's comments, as we expect the rest of the Group will.   In addition, we have the following comments:1.   In carefully analyzing the Motion for Relief from Stay as part of preparing this Response, we became convinced that the Debtor meant that the preliminary injunction was to remain effective and does not intend to grant general relief from stay as to the Federal District Court action.   It seems to us that the Debtor is basically saying by this motion that we should proceed in front of FERC, but nobody has the prerogative, without seeking further relief of stay from the court, to proceed outside of FERC to resolve the charge-back issues.   Accordingly, we did not feel it was appropriate to address this issue in the response.   The Group may want to consider approaching Debtor's counsel on this issue.2.   Technically, by asking the Court to include the Amendment 222 proceeding as part of the Relief from Stay, we are expanding the relief.   We have tried to soft sell this issue as was suggested by the Group to suggest that this is simply a related proceeding that is required to go forward to grant complete relief as part of the Debtor's motion.   If the Debtor objects to the expanded relief, the court will likely not grant it because it was not specifically the subject of the motion.   We probably need to lobby Debtor's counsel to help get this accomplished without the requirement of filing an additional motion for relief.3.   Check Exhibit A to make sure that all parties are listed and the appropriate counsel is listed.   I am trying to simply list the \"bankruptcy\" counsel so that Debtor's counsel knows initially who to contact if there is any question relative to a party.   We have not intentionally left anybody off.   If someone is missing, it is inadvertent and we will certainly add them to the list.If there are others of your Group who should receive this, please forward it to the other members of group.We have set up a conference call at 12:15 E.T. to discuss this matter.

      "body": "\nAs I mentioned over the phone, the general provisions of your tariff should be modified so that they apply to generator interconnection   (e.g., the dispute resolution provision of the tariff currently only applies to \"Transmission Service\" not interconnection service)   Although I haven't done a detailed review of PGE's tariff I noted similar concerns about Sections 6, 7.3, and 111.   Also \"transmission service\" should be capitalized.Some Other suggestions:Preamble - Sentence three - delete: \"[t]hese Interconnection Procedures do not provide for transmission service on the Transmission System.\"   Insert:   \"These Interconnection Procedures apply only to the receipt point portion of Transmission Service on the Transmission System.\"Sentence four - delete \"of the Transmission System\"   Parts II and II are defined terms.Section 2.2 - Under this provision, if the Interconnection Customer makes changes to the information supporting its interconnection request that \"materially affect its interconnection\" it can lose its place in the queue.   Given how much discretion this gives PGE, \"materially affect\" should be a defined term or have a standard for its application.Section 3.1: Revise the last sentence as follows \"The Interconnection Customer must execute, complete, and return   . . . \"Further PGE should add a provision indicating that if its merchant function desires interconnection that it should have to follow the interconnection procedures. Section 3.4 This section should be amended to require that the short circuit and stability study take into consideration higher queued projects.Section 3.4(ii): Power flow studies are only necessary for transmission service not just for interconnection.   Accordingly, Section (ii) should be changed to have the information studied for the customer's information only or to say that it is not related to the interconnection queue.Section 4.1 - When does the customer's responsibility to respond to higher-queued projects end?   Does this extend the 60-day period every time it happens?Section 4.4   In sentence two - Delete \"Network Upgrade necessary to remove overloads and\"Work the following definitions into Section 4.4:Interconnection Facilities means the local equipment necessary to connect the plant to the point of interconnection including increasing the capacity of an existing local transmission line(s) to loop the lines into the plant in the case where the capacity of the line is less than the capacity of the generating plant under good utility practice.Network Upgrades mean modifications beyond Interconnection Facilities required for safe and reliable connection of the generating plant to the utility system.   They do not include transmission changes required to deliver power beyond the point of interconnection. In sentence three delete: modifications or additions to the Transmission Provider's transmission lines and substations and add \"Network Upgrades.\"Proof-read and correct section numbers.To: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jay_dudley@pgn.com Subject: Re: Draft interconnection procedure   Comments:2.3   Delete last sentence.   If Enron is already in the queue (or considered in a queue) before a TP's interconnection procedures are filed at FERC, we don't want to have to resubmit something within 15 days in order to remain in the queue.   I don't think this is necessary and all are protected because pre-existing requests will be posted on OASIS on the queue.4.3   Enron has argued for 60 days consistent with the OATT times (lost unfortunately).   It may look odd for PGE to ask for 90 days.   PGE is protected because if it legitimately takes longer than 60 days, you send a notification.6   (((I realize that this language was included in CP&amp;L, but recommend these changes for PGE.) 6.1   Add after \"as modified by the Commission\" \"if Customer chooses to commence construction.\"6.2   Modify last sentence --- The Agreement will provide milestones toward placing the generator in service that the Interconnection Customer must make reasonable progress toward or it will lose its queue priority (after notification and opportunity to remedy.)Thanks.Mary Hain03/13/20001 12:10 PMTo: Christi Nicolaycc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Jay_dudley@pgn.com Subject: Draft interconnection procedureSince EPMI doesn't have any PGE interconnection requests pending, Jay Dudley agreed to allow us to review PGE's draft FERC interconnection filing.

(collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron Energy Marketing&lt; Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland&lt; General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")&lt;&lt; Harvey,&lt;&lt;   I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and&lt; phone calls between Michael Day, on behalf of the Enron Entities, and&lt; yourself during the past few weeks.   Here is the current status as we&lt; understand it.   Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6,&lt; 2000 and October 18, 2000 (date of your confirming email) the Enron&lt; Entities have made the following document productions in response to the&lt; subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission (the&lt; \"Commission\"):&lt;&lt; * October 13, 2000   Bate Nos. Enron Entities 0001-00025 on behalf&lt; of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos. 1-111, 20.&lt;&lt; * October 27, 2000 Bate Nos. P0001-00021115 on behalf of Portland&lt; General Responsive to Request Nos. 12, 14, 16 and 18.&lt;&lt; * November 14, 2000 Bate No. Enron Entities 00026 (Diskette with&lt; EES/EEEMC retail data) Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13, 15 to 17,&lt; and 19.&lt;&lt; * November 15, 2000 Bate No. P00021116-00021117 (Diskettes with Portland&lt; General Data, which include approximate 3555,000 wholesale transactions)&lt; Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13 to 17, and 19.&lt;&lt; We believe with these productions, we have complied with the October&lt; 6-18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES/EEEMC.   As you&lt; know, these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights&lt; to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims, defenses,&lt; objections, jurisdictional or otherwise, or other responses.&lt;&lt;   We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for&lt; EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by&lt; October 27th.   However, we were also mindful of your expressed expectation&lt; that any data provided be useful and reliable.   The collection of data you&lt; requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same&lt; location nor organized as you requested it.   In fact during our review of&lt; some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the&lt; methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.&lt; When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it&lt; would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved,&lt; we informed you of the problem.   We now understand that if we cannot give&lt; you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be&lt; available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to&lt; compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission&lt; (\"FERC\").   We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data&lt; immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the&lt; immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce&lt; accurate data.&lt;&lt;   Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number&lt; of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas&lt; served on the Enron entities.   First, we understand that many other&lt; parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the&lt; detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very&lt; sound legal grounds.   Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing&lt; on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is&lt; supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes&lt; sought by other parties served.   Third, the Commission has filed its&lt; motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data&lt; from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited&lt; hearing and production schedule.   We note that the reasons stated in the&lt; motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially&lt; different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application&lt; to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.&lt; Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a&lt; tentative order as of November 1, 2000.&lt;&lt;   Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept \"most&lt; favored nation\" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests&lt; by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that&lt; was available.   However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need&lt; for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite&lt; substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate&lt; Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described&lt; intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal&lt; objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's&lt; threatened motion to compel before FERC.&lt;&lt;   We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission&lt; has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been&lt; served with subpoenas.   We understand that there is a list for those&lt; entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been&lt; delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their&lt; rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We understand that the Commission&lt; intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities that&lt; object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We deplore&lt; these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described&lt; above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating&lt; list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.&lt;&lt;   If you have and questions or comments, please do not hesitate to&lt; contact me.&lt;&lt;   Sincerely,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Gary S.&lt; Fergus===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

However, provided there are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized drafts in advance of filing.RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues.On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.\n"

This is driven by the fact that the RTO efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders.   The problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices.   In the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3 RTOs (there are some in theEast as well).   FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams issues.   At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function 8 is lowest on their list of priorities.   Several, includig a rep from the West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched, will likely need FERC involvement to \"force\" a compromise or settlement.   The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves to address the seams issues.   Our argument, of course, is that these are the entities that have the least incentive to patch the seams. So, by August, the ESC intends to file at FERC the disposition of 26 scheduling practices - whether there is a single standard for each practice, or exactly which ones cannot be agreed upon to be standard (e.g. - losses, ramp rates).   My supsicion is that there will be very little commonality ( for example - I am leading a group defining Congestion Management practices that will likely find very little common practice due to the diversity of congestion management approaches in the East) and that the filing will merely point out that several scheduling practices need to remain inconsistent at the borders -for reliability reasons internal to each RTO.   The threat to us is that in order to schedule between RTOs, it may require some \"lowest common denominator\" approach that burdens one market with the ineffeciencies of another.If there are any pressing scheduling inconsistencies you see coming that will impede markets in the West due to the formation of RTOs, please express those to me as I am a bit removed from the activities of the West.   Enron is party to a petition for FERC to hold a technical conference on seams issues to highlight the importance to the marketplace to patch the seams.   I do intend to continue representing Enron at the ESC and hopefully with some additional FERC initiatives, put in place as many common scheduling practices as possible.Cara Semperger03/222/20001 02:555 PMTo: Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Electronic SchedulingHi Charles, I was going over the NERC meeting minutes and noticed that you were in attendance at the meeting.

It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its customers.   To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has merely conditioned its rates \"subject to refund.\"   Accordingly, it is inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of insolvency.   It has simply said that \"there is no assurance that the actual wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially may be ordered.\"San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.   This allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.   This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the Commission March 9 order. The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in the market for years - \"pending a final nonappealable order in these proceedings.\"   Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 order finding that it would not order cost based rates.This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of wholesale power \"in the California markets\" not just for sales in the ISO and PX markets.\n"

The rate hike took effect immediately but=\r=20\rprobably won't show up in customer bills until May.=20\rBut while PUC commissioners said they were taking a bold step, major holes=\r=20\rremain in the state's patchwork effort to save the two beleaguered utilitie=\rs=20\rand ensure reliable energy supplies during what promises to be a long, hot=\r=20\rsummer:=20\rThe higher rates won't pay off billions in old utility debts, leaving PG&amp;E=\r=20\rand Edison under the continued threat of a bankruptcy filing by power=20\rgenerators, bondholders or other creditors.=20\rThe increases will likely curtail energy consumption, but it's unlikely the=\r=20\rcutbacks will be enough to stave off rolling blackouts this summer. The PUC=\r=20\rput off a crucial decision on how to allocate the rate hikes across custome=\rr=20\rcategories, and the final rate design could determine how much Californians=\r=20\rwill conserve.=20\rThe vote may not achieve one of its key goals: reviving the wind farms,=20\rcogenerators and other=20\ralternative-energy producers that provide more than 20 percent of=20\rCalifornia's electricity.

But=20\rcritics say it does not solve the fundamental problem of runaway wholesale=\r=20\relectricity prices.\r???\"The PUC has done all it can do to fight wholesale energy prices that=\r=20\rare unjust and unreasonable,\" said commission President Loretta Lynch. \"We=\r=20\rmaintain the responsibility to keep the lights on. . . . I believe that=20\radding another 3 cents will comprehensively address the need for revenues.\"\r???The commission took steps to have utilities begin paying the state=20\rDepartment of Water Resources for the nearly $3 billion in power it has=20\rpurchased for them since mid-January.\r???The PUC also ordered utilities to start paying for future power from=\r=20\ralternative energy producers who are starved for cash and struggling to=20\roperate. The blackouts last Monday and Tuesday were precipitated in part by=\r=20\rloss of power from such companies.\r???But it was the rate increase proposal that packed the auditorium at PU=\rC=20\rheadquarters. And the drama of the vote---and the vocal opposition---spurred=\r=20\reach of the five commissioners to forcefully defend the unpopular action.\r???\"These are extraordinary moments in California's history,\" declared=20\rCommissioner Geoffrey Brown, a recent appointee of Gov. Gray Davis. \"And=20\rextraordinary moments require extraordinary courage. Loretta Lynch has take=\rn=20\ra lot of bad hits. But it was she who stepped up to the role of leader in=\r=20\rCalifornia.\"\r ???Rate Increase Lacked Support\r???Lynch proposed the rate increase, even though an administrative law=20\rjudge at the PUC concluded that an increase was unnecessary and the PUC's o=\rwn=20\rconsumer protection arm, the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, opposed it. She=\r=20\ralso did not have the public support of Davis, who appointed her and two=20\rother commissioners.\r???Davis has distanced himself from the PUC's action, saying the commissi=\ron=20\rwas acting independently and that he remains unconvinced that a rate increa=\rse=20\ris necessary.\r???Commissioners Henry Duque and Richard Bilas---who were appointed by=20\rRepublican Gov. Pete Wilson---called the rate hikes long overdue.\r???\"Unless ratepayers want to face substantial rolling blackouts this=20\rsummer, we have to start paying our power bills,\" Duque said. \"It cannot be=\r=20\rdone with the current rates.\"\r???Saying \"there is just no blood left in the turnip,\" Bilas warned that=\r=20\r\"absent an immediate rate increase, the utilities will be in Bankruptcy=20\rCourt.\"\r???Before the vote, sign-carrying protesters chanted, \"Rate hikes, no way=\r,=20\rmake the energy companies pay.\" And the commission heard a parade of=20\rwitnesses, most opposing the rate increase. Some called on the state to use=\r=20\reminent domain to seize power plants, as Davis said he might do as a last=\r=20\rresort.\r???Doug Heller, of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in San=\rta=20\rMonica, told the commission, \"Go to these power pirates and tell them the=\r=20\rstate treasury is not their money orchard.\"\r???Barbara George, of Women's Energy Matters, said, \"We should give the=\r=20\rgenerators 24 hours to sign their plants over to the state and leave.\" Geor=\rge=20\rwas one of several people ejected for repeatedly disrupting the meeting.\r???At a hearing Monday, representatives of agriculture and manufacturing=\r=20\rindustries warned that the increase would hurt their members and the=20\rCalifornia economy.\r???The rate hike is the state's largest, according to the Office of=20\rRatepayer Advocates, which researched the issue.\r???Because the electricity rate is just one of many charges on a monthly=\r=20\rutility bill, the overall effect will be about a 28% increase in monthly=20\rbills, said PUC staff.\r???Before the PUC action, homeowners and renters in Edison territory paid=\r=20\r7.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for electricity and another 5.3 cents per=20\rkilowatt-hour for other services. The new rate, totaling 15.5 cents per=20\rkilowatt-hour, boosts the overall bill by about 24%. The increase is about=\r=20\r26% for PG&amp;E residential customers. But under Lynch's proposal, those=20\rincreases would not be applied equally.\r???To encourage conservation, she seeks a tiered system that would charge=\r=20\rmiserly consumers of energy no more than current rates but would impose the=\r=20\rnew higher rates on bigger users.\r???The proposal aims the rate increase at those customers who use 30% or=\r=20\rmore beyond a so-called baseline amount, which is about half of the average=\r=20\rresidential use per month and varies by region.\r???Exactly who will pay the higher electricity rate will be determined by=\r=20\rthe PUC in hearings over the next month. Under Lynch's proposal, nearly hal=\rf=20\rof all residential customers would be spared rate increases.\r ???Tiered Rates to Encourage Saving\r???Energy experts say tiered rates would encourage conservation, but they=\r=20\rdisagree about how much.\r???Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, general manager of the Los=20\rAngeles Department of Water and Power, said utilities have long used tiered=\r=20\rrates when charging low-income customers. \"So this is not brand new. It's=\r=20\rjust a more aggressive use of it,\" he said.\r???UC Irvine economist Peter Navarro said he doubted that tiered rates=20\rwould do much to stave off blackouts. The greatest conservation gains come=\r=20\rfrom investment in efficient appliances, he said, and that's why tiered rat=\res=20\rare \"no magic bullet.\"\r???The increase will not show up in utility bills until May at the=20\rearliest, said Paul Clanon, chief of the PUC's energy division.\r???The higher charges for electricity consumed between now and whenever t=\rhe=20\rnew rate structure is incorporated in monthly bills will be calculated=20\rretroactively and charged to future bills, Clanon said.\r???Utility executives and consumer advocates all threw up their hands at=\r=20\rthe question of whether the rate hike will be enough.\r???\"Have we gotten the number right?\" Duque said. \"I don't know. I hope w=\re=20\rhave. But this is a step in the right direction, and we'll return any money=\r=20\rnot used to buy power.\"\r???Bruce Foster, a Southern California Edison vice president, also said t=\rhe=20\rrate increase is a step in the right direction. \"Only time will tell,\" he=\r=20\rsaid, \"if it is sufficient to meet the need.\"\r???In a statement, PG&amp;E welcomed the PUC action as a \"dose of realism,\" b=\rut=20\rsaid the commission left unresolved a host of issues, including how much=20\rmoney the utility will have to pay for power that the state purchases for=\r=20\rPG&amp;E customers.\r???The PUC estimates that the increase will bring in an additional $4.8=\r=20\rbillion annually from the 24 million people served by Edison and PG&amp;E.\r???But that amount doesn't go far in today's California wholesale=20\relectricity market.\r???The state and utilities spent $5.2 billion in January buying=20\relectricity.

These responses assumes that you sent separate data requests to Enron Wind, so they do not include that information.   The answers also assume you are requesting this information for California (and therefore the Western interconnect) only.   Please let me know if these assumptions are incorrect.   If you were requesting Eastern Interconnect information you need to contact Chrisit Nicolay at the above E-mail address.   Enron requests confidential treatment of response numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Section 3888.1112.   Due to the short turn around time for these requests we were unable to respond to question 8 and to provide the Unit Identifier requested in question 4.   We hope to be able to provide this information on Monday.   Please call me with any questions at (503) 464-88862.

The Market Monitoring Committee (MMC) should not make findings, it should simply refer the information it gets to FERC about abuse of market power and violations of antitrust and if should report that information subject to confidentiality.   Also, if contrary to our wishes, the FERC allows market monitoring committees to further investigate, make findings, and impose penalties, FERC must require the tariffs to contain detailed due process requirements that: (1) specifically name the behavior that is illegal and relate any penalties to specific violations, (2) require the MMC to notify the party being invested of the tariff or law that may have been violated, (3) allow the party being investigated to perform discovery on any other party (including the ISO or the PX) that may instead be at fault or may be a contributing party, (4) to facilitate this discovery, allow a party to know the identity of the party (if any) that alerted the MMC to the alleged violation, and (5) detail the process for any discovery, hearing, or ADR process to ensure the party being investigated has adequate notice and opportunity to be heard and to impute others who may instead be at fault. \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   \"Jackie Gallagher\" &lt;JGallagher@epsa.org&lt;   01/12/20001 09:14 AM To: &lt;bhawkin@enron.com&lt;, &lt;bmerola@enron.com&lt;, &lt;christi.l.nicolay@enron.com&lt;, &lt;donna.fulton@enron.com&lt;, &lt;janelle.scheuer@enron.com&lt;, &lt;jeff_brown@enron.com&lt;, &lt;jhartso@enron.com&lt;, &lt;Mary.Hain@enron.com&lt;, &lt;sarah.novosel@enron.com&lt;, &lt;tom.hoatson@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: FERC Conference on Market Monitoring- REVISED DRAFTMEMORANDUMTO: Regulatory Affairs Committee   Power Marketers Working GroupFROM: Joe Hartsoe, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair   Bob Reilley, Power Marketing Working Group Chair   Julie Simon, Vice President of PolicyDATE: January 12, 20001RE: FERC Conference on Market Monitoring in California   ? Revised Draft   ? Conference Call on Tuesday, January 16th, 2:000 p.m.   (EST), 1-8000-937-6563Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversations with some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of Guiding Principles on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference on January 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISO markets.   The most significant change from the prior draft is that we now delete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices in California and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for market monitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs, opportunity costs and scarcity values.FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at the January 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there is consensus on this approach.   We will discuss this draft on a conference call on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:000 p.m. (EST).   To access the call, please dial 1-8000-937-6563.   Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.

I do not, however, believe that he is breaking new legal ground here, although the reference to Section 309 is (I believe) the first time in these cases that FERC or any of the individual Commissioners cited specifically to this section of the FPA as possible authority for ordering retroactive refunds prior to the 10/2/000 \"refund effective date.\"   (I have attached Hoecker's opinion; the reference to Section 309 is on page 111.)Section 309 is the provision of the FPA that grants FERC authority to take action \"necessary and proper\" to carry out the other substantive provisions of the Act, such as ensuring \"just and reasonable\" rates under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act; however, the courts have interpreted Sec. 309 as not expanding FERC's substantive authority otherwise granted under other provisions of the Act; it only provides FERC with authority as necessary for it to fill in the \"missing blanks\" in the substantive provisions of the Act, such as Sec. 206.)Several years ago, FERC ordered retroactive refunds in a Washington Water Power case where the utility had violated its tariff.   Here, Hoecker is simply suggesting that FERC could do the same if it turns out that any seller violated the ISO's or PX's tariff last summer by engaging in \"collusion, predatory pricing, or unlawful manipulation of prices.\"   As long as EPMI followed   the ISO's and PX's market rules last summer, I see nothing in Hoecker's opinion that undermines our view that the filed rate doctrine prevents refunds of all amounts collected in accordance with the market rules prior to 10/2/000; i.e., in the absence of a violation of the tariff or FPA, nothing in Hoecker's opinion suggests that Sec. 309 modifies the prohibition of Sec. 206 against retroactive refunds prior to the refund effective date (10/2/000).Ron&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;Susan.J.Mara@enron.com&lt; 01/08/01 02:23PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Dan and/or Ron,Hoecker is quoted here as saying (p.2) that FERC has all the authority itneeds to \"disgorge\" profits under Section 309 of the FPA.

In the complaint, Mirant alleges that the ISO is violating the Federal Power Act and prior FERC orders through (1) waiving the applicable credit requirements for the IOUs prior to FERC approval (particularly in light of the ISO's inability to pay suppliers for energy provided); (2) failing to pursue all available remedies against defaulting parties; and (3) seating a non-independent governance board.The relief sought by Mirant is as follows:   (1) that it be required to sell wholesale power only on commercially reasonable terms that provide for adequate assurances of payment; (2) that FERC order the ISO not to change its rates unilaterally in violation of the Filed Rate Doctrine; and (3) that FERC require the ISO adhere to the specific provisions of its tariff and FERC orders.Mirant has requested fast track processing for this complaint.   It appears that FERC is granting this request; FERC noticed the complaint on Feb. 8, and established Feb. 26 as the due date for interventions/protests and answers. - mirant.tiff.zip\n"

This paper will be proposed to the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative for inclusion in the response to the FERC OASIS Phase II ANOPR.Southern Company Mktg is leading the charge to prevent disclosure of such data.   This fight is lining up as those marketers with large gen assets vs. those who don't.Transmission customer reps on NERC committees and subcommittees working independently outside the NERC process cannot agree on a pro or con position however, many support putting these 2 arguments in front of FERC for action.I will push for filing both the pro and con positions to be filed in the ANOPR response.---",

Bill Newman ( Sr. VP Transmission ; leads the RTO work on market structure and transmission planning) said they were disappointed that FERC did not respond to their filing as a declaratory filing, but appeared to be trying to force a filing for approval of a proposed RTO.   He said, at this point, they were planning to restart discussions with all the parties around Southern to explore whether they could get agreement on a larger RTO, but they had not decided that combining was necessary.   He also said that it might be easier to combine with GridSouth than Entergy, Florida, etc., but it might not work out that way.   We discussed the response from FERC concerning the treatment of bundled retail.   He was puzzled by the difference in treatment from GridSouth, since both appear to have the same practical outcome.\n"

In those groups we would be selling the concept.   Actual implementation of the provisions would be in the tariff content group, where the actual requirements would be codified.   This way it will be blessed by FERC and built into all operating protocols.Steve\tAlan Comnes\t02/18/20001 01:17 PM \t\t\t To: steve.walton@enron.com, mhain@enron.com\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Information RequirementsSteve, Mary,Where in the RTO West process should Enron make its pitch for information transparency?   To me, it would be part of the scheduling / ancillary services work group and part of congestion managment.   I am assuming we do not want to leave it to Makret Monitoring because to get information release in real-time or near-real-time requires that information release systems get built into the actual RTO operational systems.At some point, we need to weigh in and try to get information release built into the Stage 2 filings.Thanks,Alan\n"

There is a very business mined independent board that is very helpful.   We are getting most everything we want in the DSTAR arena.   The only problem with the governance of DSTAR is that public power tries to dominate the advisory groups to give a front to legitimize its votes giving advice to the board.   The board is very aware of this and does its job well.   There was discussion with my SWPTF and the southwestern jurisdictional utilities to merge DSTAR and California and the effort was going very well until senator peace started some of his antics.   Anyway, DSTARs a very good process right now.\n"

If FERC were to decertify the CAISO and order the CAutilities to join a regional RTO, I believe that DSTAR, the CaliforniaIOUs and the CAISO infrastructure/staff/systems could easily merge andbe up and running as a large Desert Southwest + California RTO beforethe end of the year.   This was basically what I had been trying toachieve last summer when I was facilitating talks between CAISO andDSTAR parties about merging the two.Why not lobby for that as the FERC-preferred solution to the state'sillegal takeover of CAISO governance?Carl___Susan.J.Mara@enron.com wrote:&lt;&lt; Carl,&lt;&lt; It looks like CDWR is having some problems related to buying Operating&lt; Reserves.

Wednesday, April 18, at 10 a.m.The NERC Board of Trustees is scheduled to have a very important meeting on Friday, March 30th, on the future organization of NERC-the so-called \"NERC to NAERO transition.\"   NERC is poised to eliminate its traditional board structure, long dominated by its regional councils, and adopt an independent board along with some form of a stakeholder advisory committee.   This watershed event provides an opportunity for EPSA, and its member companies, to carefully evaluate participation in NERC, its committees and the activities in the regions.Specifically, we want to focus on what matters, if any, NERC is presently addressing that warrant the continued attention and participation of EPSA and/or its members.   For those issues that are affecting, or could potentially affect, the business interests of EPSA's members, what is the most efficient and effective role EPSA could play?   What is the best forum for resolving reliability-related technical issues beyond FERC's expertise?To facilitate this discussion, EPSA will be hosting a half-day summit to discuss the outcome of NERC's March 30th meeting and its implications for EPSA's allocation of resources to NERC activities on Wednesday, April 18 at 10 a.m.   We encourage members to attend in person at the new EPSA offices at 1401 New York Ave., 111th Floor, Washington, D.C.   However, we will also make participation by conference call available.   We encourage all companies, whether or not they are currently active in NERC, to participate in this important meeting.Please RSVP for the meeting using the form below to Jackie Gallagher either by fax (202-628-8260) or e-mail (jgallagher@epsa.org).NERC Summit___   Yes, I will attend the April 18th meeting___   No, I will not be able to attend in person, but I would like to   participate by phone.Name:___ Company:___Phone: ___ E-mail:___\n"

Comments Due By Wednesday, April 4th, Close of BusinessMost of the 19 states subject to the NOx-SIP Call rule have submitted draft or final plans to revise their state implementation plans (SIPs) to meet the rule's emission-reduction requirements.   U.S. EPA is in various stages of reviewing and taking action on the plans.   It is expected that Northeastern states' plans will generally be acted upon first since they were among the first to be submitted.North Carolina and Michigan are both in the process of finalizing their plans for implementing the NOx SIP-Call rule.   Both of their rules, as currently drafted, contain approaches of particular concern to merchant suppliers.   Specifically, both feature provisions that could limit significantly the number of allowances available to new generating facilities.EPSA has drafted comments to these states advocating more reasonable approaches, which will be more likely to ensure sufficient allowances to support capacity additions.   A copy of the drafts is attached for review.   Please provide any comments on the letter to Samantha Slater at (202) 628-82000 or sslater@epsa.org no later than the close of business on Wednesday, April 4th.   Please contact Samantha Slater at EPSA for further information.Attachments - EPSA NC letter.doc - EPSA MI letter.doc\n"

our meeting for this coming Friday, March 23, 20001,from 8:30 a.m. to 111:000 a.m. at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel.Because there are fewer items on the agenda, this RRG meeting should beshorter than usual, and we hope to wrap up by 111:000 a.m.The purpose of the meeting is primarily to discuss with the RRG a phasedapproach to implementing congestion management.   The filing utilities arevery aware of the concerns many parties have expressed about processoverload, and the burden this imposes on you. Consequently, the filingutilities are considering a more focused process that will call forprioritizing the work streams over the next few weeks.   Part of this morefocused process is a proposal for a potential phasing of congestionmanagement implementation. A background paper for your review before themeeting is attached.The working agenda is:1. Market Monitoring:   Recommendation Regarding Stage 1 Decision2. Clarification of RTO West Treatment of Losses3. Clarification of Stage 1 Decision on Interconnection Standards4... Potential Phasing of Congestion Management Implementation5. Report on TransConnect6. Benefit-Cost StudyA word about the new benefit-cost study.   It is my view that before we canprofitably engage in a new study that will be useful to regional parties anumber of issues need to be resolved first.   For example, it will beimportant to know and not just assume what the scope and regionalconfiguration of RTO West is likely to be.   We are all waiting for FERC'sresponse to the October 23 filing and its declaratory order regarding theRTO West scope and regional configuration as proposed in the October 23application.   The reason for my uncertainty and the need for clarificationon scope and regional configuration is FERC's press release of March 14 inwhich it \"encouraged the formation of a regional transmission organization(RTO) for the western markets.\"   What does this mean for RTO West? Inaddition to understanding the scope of RTO West, it will also be importantto know and not just assume what the congestion and pricing models will befor RTO West.   Determining these models will probably take a few more weeks.As we discussed in earlier RRG meetings, a benefit-cost analysis may becomeimportant parts of filings with the various state commissions.Understanding what the state commissions are looking for is also important.Because of   the need for this information, and the more focused process weare considering, I have recommended to the filing utilities that thebenefit-cost work be deferred until these issues are resolved.   I wouldappreciate your views on this subject at the RRG meeting as well.I look forward to seeing you this Friday, March 23.- Bud - Congestion Model Disc 3-20-01.doc\n"

Thus, we are in position to receive a 2/1/01 effective date of the termination.Although we achieved our primary objective, we will unfortunately need to file an \"errata\" tomorrow to (1) attach the EES and EEMC letters of termination, which were received too late to be included in the filing, and (2) to correct certain collation glitches (of the attachements) that occurred during production.Query: With regard to EPMI, the filing only terminates its Participation Agreement in the PX's core markets (day-ahead and day-of).   It does not reference CTS.   Is this correct?Mary: Based upon our conversation earlier today, I was under the impression that PGE had previously terminated its arrangements with the PX, so we agreed to delete all references to PGE and not make the filing on its behalf.   However, after the filing was made, I received a copy of the termination letter that PGE sent to the PX today. What is PGE's correct status?   (If we need to file for PGE, we should do a separate filing for it tomorrow.   I want the errata that we are doing tomorrow for EPMI, EES and EEMC to be treated as an \"errata\" to today's filing, so we cannot add new matters.)Ron\n"

Offers are due by March 28 and PGE has until April 5, 20001 to accept .   I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC under the terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.   I have also told him that EPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take the regulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of any contract in PGE's favor.   I would recommend the former.   Ron - would you tell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,   in the event PGE accepts our offer?

Greg Wolfe has a history on this one---apparently we've been contacted by Puget in the past, by certain of the customers in the past, and by consultants to the customers.   Also, Dave Fuller was inquiring about Puget's customers as well.   I know a bunch of the folks involved and may be able to help bridge some of the gaps---but my contacts are certainly not unique.   As a final note, we need to be careful as Robert McCullough used to consult for Bellingham Cold Storage and GP---two of the companies involved in the mess.   Robert is not a friend of ours.

PSE   Formal Complaint - Docket UE-0001952   This week, the Commission is hearing evidence regarding the level of a \"soft   cap\" on prices PSE charges some large customers.   On January 26, Public Counsel and Commission Staff filed a joint answer on   the rate cap mechanism.   On Jan. 222, the UTC approved a temporary \"soft-price\" cap for power rates   paid by 13 large industrial customers of Puget Sound Energy (PSE). A   short-term soft cap would allow PSE to charge above the cap for power costs   if the utility was paying more than a maximum level.   The order calls for a second set of proceedings to establish the level of the   temporary soft cap as a term under the provisions of Schedule 48 and the   PSE/Georgia-Pacific Special Contract. The cap would be in place pending   further proceedings to determine a final disposition of Schedule 48.   Puget's 13 large industrial customers are: Boeing, Georgia-Pacific, Air Liquide   America Corp. CNC Containers, Equilon Enterprises, Air Products and   Chemicals, Inc., Tesoro Northwest, City of Anacortes, Intel Corp., King   County's Metro Wastewater Treatment Division, Olympic Pipe-Bayview,   Qwest and MCI WorldCo \n"

AIRPORT HOTELHello, Everyone -Most of the dust has settled from the flurry of RTO West filings, motions,interventions, comments, protests, and answers that have consumed all of ourattention over the past few weeks. In looking through the list of fileddocuments on the RTO West website, one can't help but be struck by theincredible amount of hard work that has gone into the analysis and draftingof the documents submitted to FERC.   We appreciate the dedication ofeveryone to making the RTO West proposal as strong as possible.Now that we've had a few days to relax (just kidding), it's now timely forus to come together to determine where we've been, where we are now, andwhere we'd like to go in the future.   To get started, the RTO West FilingUtilities invite you to an open regional meeting next Friday, December 15,2000 at the Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel, Mt. Hood Rooms A &amp; B.   (Let'sstart out on familiar territory.)   The meeting will start at 9:30 a.m. andend at 2:30 p.m.   The Filing Utilities would like you to join them for aninformal buffet lunch so we can maximize the amount of discussion timetogether.   I hear rumors that there will be festivities appropriate to theoccasion.Our working agenda for the meeting is:1. Opening remarks and welcome from the Filing Utilities2. Overview of Stage One filings3. Proposed Stage Two deliverables4. Stage Two participation by interested parties a.   Lessons learned from Stage One b. Discussion of guiding principles for Stage Two process LUNCH   -   Roundtable discussions as we enjoy the Sheraton's \"Oregon Buffet\" c. Reports and feedback (verbal) from the Roundtables5. Next steps and proposed meetingsIf you have suggestions for what we might add to the working agenda, pleaselet me know.

The FERC staff is no less commited to RTOs, and I'm sure the IOUs are no less committed for that reason.   In addition, I doubt FERC Commissioners in the new administration will back-track on RTO formation especially because of what has happened in California (how the state took too much control of ISO formation and control).From: James D Steffes@ENRON on 01/222/20001 07:51 AM CSTTo: Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECTcc: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: RTO West Meeting of January 12   Sean, et al ---My understanding of what Enron wants from an RTO is (a) liquid energy markets (spot and forward) and (b) manageable transmission risk.   Of course, there are a great deal of sub-issues that need to be implemented for these high-level objectives to be met.I don't disagree that simple solutions make sense for most RTOs given the current state of the market (specifically the backlash from California) and the politics at FERC about \"enforcing\" Order 2000 (remember the Order was voluntary).   On the other hand, now may be an opportunity to lay the framework for really pushing hard on getting the rules right; policies of the past have been half-way or incomplete.   Sometimes it takes a crisis for policymakers to do the right thing.Too this point, we are trying to engage the Western Governors and other political leaders outside California to continue to drive toward something that won't resemble California.Jim\tSean Crandall@ECT\t01/21/20001 01:57 PM \t\t\t To: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Walton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t Subject: Re: RTO West Meeting of January 12Alan,Thanks for the update.I think the amount of time we allocate to the RTO West, and the extent we coordinate with other marketers, has to be reevaluated in light of what is going on in California.   The California blow up is bound to raise some serious concerns in the Northwest (the e-mail from the PPC guy is probably the first of many), as well it should.   I think a driving concern we should have, particularly now, is that the primary objective of the RRG is to lay the framework for a successful market place and to NOT try and solve all problems and get mired down in complexities and software limitations.   I would argue the intial RTO framework has to be simple and adaptable.   What is it exactly Enron wants?   Do we want all control areas collapsed, a ancillary service market, a non-contract-path-based congestion management system?   Why?   How prudent is it to forge ahead while California is in such disarray?   Is the goal to just comply with FERC, or to create something that will provide a basis for a sound market in (initially) a simple easily-understood manner?   Can we get 85% of what we want without multiple congestion runs, markets driven by software, weird FTRs, and disconnected cash and real-time markets?I would argue we should advocate simplicity.   What gives us the biggest bang for our buck coming out of the gate?   Deal with that, implement it, see how it works, adjust as necessary, and then move on.   The danger now is that people see California and deregulation as one in the same.   They are not going to trust complicated changes, and it is going to be difficult to assure them they will work.   We should be able to specifically lay out the top 5 issues we have with the way the Northwest market is structured now, why it costs money and/or is inefficient from a market perspective, and what simple steps could be taken to resolve these issues.   I think we should become adept at explaining exactly why the California market did not work, and why the California market is not synonymous with deregulation and open, competitive markets.   We may even want to sponsor some sort of conference.My bottom line is, I guess, is that I would like us to advocate smart changes for the sake of a sound market (even if they are simple and straight-forward), and not so much get hung up on what FERC thinks open-access is or should be.\n"

If a developer of a generation project needs to build transmission to get its energy to market, they should be allowed to build it and get FTRs.   This presumes that the builder will have to negotiate the obstacle course associated with construction (environmental, reliability, and other siting approvals).   There are currently so many safeguards in place and building is so difficult, that any requirement for open season may well be generated when you try to use scarce right of way to build less than an optimal line.

The vote was\ralong straight party lines.   The following are some of the key comments\rmade during the debate.   Senators are identified by party affiliation.\rThe Senate did not take up SBX 6.\r Sen. Morrow (R):   This bill is like a partial birth abortion   - we never\rgave the market a chance to work right.   It=01,s the generators who are\rgetting the raw deal.\r Sen. McClintock (R):   Of the all the choices the Administration could\rchoose to resolve this crisis, they are choosing two of the worst, to\rraise rates and to ensure blackouts.   LADWP is the biggest price gouger\rof them all so there is no reason to believe a public power authority\rwill be better.   I would support a public power authority only to build\rnew generation.\r Sen. Kuehl (D) :   The free market works only if we can say =01&amp;no=018 to th=\re\rproduct =01) can=01,t say no to energy.   Acquiring transmission lines gives\rthe state control over the provision of energy.\r Sen. Scott (D) :   Reliant is spending $3000 million to name a dome after\ritself.   My district has 3 MUD=01,s who rejected deregulation and the\rratepayers are happy.\r Sen. Bowen (D) The only question is how much of a premium we=01,ll have to\rpay for bureaucracy to run the system.   Would you prefer to be gouged by\runbridled market power and name stadiums in faraway places or have\rchecks and balances?\r Sen. Haynes (R):   If we don=01,t get more power, we=01,re just rearranging =\rthe\rdeck chairs on the Titanic.   Regulatory burdens prevent companies from\rbuilding in CA.   Do we want to use public dollars or private dollars to\rbuild generation.   More government won=01,t get rid of the shortage while\rletting more entrepreneurial money in will create a buyers market.\r Sen. Peace (D):   The Houston cartel with their protectors at FERC are in\ra wholesale attack on CA ratepayers.   Removing price caps, fixing the\rISO and PX and encouraging more retail competition won=01,t fix the\rwholesale market.   Our constituents are threatened because FERC won=01,t do\rits job.   Those who didn=01,t play by the rules are responsible for this.\rReliant insists that CA indemnify them from lawsuits =01) these people know\rthey were charging illegal rates and they would lose lawsuits.   These\rbills are the only choice the kidnapers have given us.   Vote for it or\rraise the lone star flag over the Capitol.\r Sen Alarcon (D):   When I was on the L.A. City Council some of these same\rprivate companies wanted to buy LADWP.   Their goal is to eliminate all\rpublic power.\r Sen Burton (D):   If we have our own peaker power then Reliant and Enron\rwould gladly sell us the rest of our power needs.   They are robber\rbarons and we have no sympathy for them\r   \n"

I know you weren't asking for a response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases).In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee.   Par. 31,036 at 31,797.   So in general, customers can't avoid paying for stranded costs simply by bypassing.   FERC allowed utilities to file for recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before July 111, 19994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery.   Id. at 31,810.   There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass.   For contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a stranded cost provision.   However, in that case, the utility could seek to recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable expectation of continuing to serve.   Id. at note 679.   Accordingly, the customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission service.If the loophole does not apply (because the contract does not have such a notice provision), the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section 206 proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable, wherein the customer would have the burden of proof.   But, if they do, the incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost recovery but it must do so in that customer's Section 206 proceeding.   Order No. 888-A, Par 31,049 at 30,4000.   Likewise, if the utility has already filed for recovery of stranded costs, the customer must make any Section 206 claim in that case.   Id.The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred costs.   However, FERC will only entertain requests to recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required.   Order No. 888 at 31,824-25.   I don't know anything about what the individual states have done.I hope this helps.To: Robert Frank/NA/Enron@ENRONcc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Stranded costs   Sarah and I will check on this because Enron did some research on it several years ago.

Estimated bills\rFERC allows the ISO to implement a blended \"automated/manual\" process to=20\rimplement the ISO's load imbalance penalty.   To simplify the settlement=20\rprocess, the ISO is allowed to institute estimated billing procedures on a=\r=20\rtemporary basis.   Does EPMI have a serious problem with being billed on an=\r=20\restimated basis?\r 2. Documenting Incremental Seller Costs, Including Opportunity Costs\r The FERC order raises important issues with regard to documenting our costs=\r,=20\rwhich will be required on all sales to the ISO or PX effective on 1/1/01.   =\rIn=20\rits discussion of the $150/MWh breakpoint, FERC states: \"In recognition of=\r=20\rthe unworkable complexities that the opportunity cost concept introduces in=\r=20\rthe ISO real-time imbalance market, we will eliminate it.\"   Enron will=20\rundoubtedly raise the impermissibility of opportunity costs in its rehearin=\rg=20\rrequest.   Among other things, EPMI will   argue that opportunity costs are a=\r=20\rlegitimate economic cost, that such costs are used in transmission pricing,=\r=20\rand that without such costs the FERC is essentially taking=20\rgenerator/marketers back to cost-of-service ratemaking\r This being said, EPMI must operate without the benefit of using opportunity=\r=20\rcosts as a basis for documenting above-$150/MWh accepted bids effective=20\r1/1/01.\r As noted in the list of information that must be reported by Enron (see=20\rMary's summary or p. 59 of the FERC order), sellers that have not generated=\r=20\rtheir own power can report \"purchase price\".   Is West Trading prepared to=\r=20\rdocument every above-$150/MWh sale to the ISO or PX with an associated=20\r\"purchase price?\"   In addition, other costs that clearly apply to a=20\rmarketer---such as transmission access costs, transmission losses, expected=\r=20\rreplacement power costs, start-up/no-load costs---are not allowed on the=20\rlist.   (We should not the omission of these costs in our petition for=20\rrehearing.)\r In several places in the order, the Commission states that sellers should b=\re=20\rallowed to earn reasonable profits but little guidance is given.

EPMI as a power marketer, has a highly=20\rvariable load, I assume.   Do we need to seek clarification from FERC or ISO=\r=20\ron how ISO will measure the load (annual average, annual peak, monthly peak=\r?)=20\rused to determine whether the applicable penalty threshold   is 10 MW or 5%?=\r =20\rGuidance from traders would be appreciated.\r b. Estimated bills\rFERC allows the ISO to implement a blended \"automated/manual\" process to=20\rimplement the ISO's load imbalance penalty.   To simplify the settlement=20\rprocess, the ISO is allowed to institute estimated billing procedures on a=\r=20\rtemporary basis.   Does EPMI have a serious problem with being billed on an=\r=20\restimated basis?\r 2. Documenting Incremental Seller Costs, Including Opportunity Costs\r The FERC order raises important issues with regard to documenting our costs=\r,=20\rwhich will be required on all sales to the ISO or PX effective on 1/1/01.   =\rIn=20\rits discussion of the $150/MWh breakpoint, FERC states: \"In recognition of=\r=20\rthe unworkable complexities that the opportunity cost concept introduces in=\r=20\rthe ISO real-time imbalance market, we will eliminate it.\"   Enron will=20\rundoubtedly raise the impermissibility of opportunity costs in its rehearin=\rg=20\rrequest.   Among other things, EPMI will   argue that opportunity costs are a=\r=20\rlegitimate economic cost, that such costs are used in transmission pricing,=\r=20\rand that without such costs the FERC is essentially taking=20\rgenerator/marketers back to cost-of-service ratemaking\r This being said, EPMI must operate without the benefit of using opportunity=\r=20\rcosts as a basis for documenting above-$150/MWh accepted bids effective=20\r1/1/01.\r As noted in the list of information that must be reported by Enron (see=20\rMary's summary or p. 59 of the FERC order), sellers that have not generated=\r=20\rtheir own power can report \"purchase price\".   Is West Trading prepared to=\r=20\rdocument every above-$150/MWh sale to the ISO or PX with an associated=20\r\"purchase price?\"   In addition, other costs that clearly apply to a=20\rmarketer---such as transmission access costs, transmission losses, expected=\r=20\rreplacement power costs, start-up/no-load costs---are not allowed on the=20\rlist.   (We should not the omission of these costs in our petition for=20\rrehearing.)\r In several places in the order, the Commission states that sellers should b=\re=20\rallowed to earn reasonable profits but little guidance is given.   The only=\r=20\rconcrete guidance I found was in Massey's concurring opinion which identifi=\red=20\r$25/MWh as a \"reasonable capacity adder.\"\r Accepted bids below $150/MWh do not require documentation.   The preliminary=\r=20\ropinion from our discussion today was that such bids are in a =01&amp;safe harb=\ror=018=20\rzone and it appears that refund risk on such transactions is much less.\r\n"

That is, in the near   term we should focus on key critical path tasks and then return to additional   work efforts once the critical path items have been more fully   developed.?In response to these suggestions, we have substantially   revised the RTO West meeting calendar for the remainder of March and for the   entire month of April.? The revised calendar has now been posted on the RTO   West Stage 2 Main Page, which you can view by clicking on the link   below:?http:///208.555.67.64/Stage2Index.htm?The specific effect this near-term re-focusing will have on the Tariff   Integration Group is that?tariff work will be suspended for a time while   other work takes?first priority.?

The March 30 conference call that was set up specifically to   discuss ADR will be held as planned, however.?

Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday morning.   We want to have 15 people attend this course.   I realize that this is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can find a replacement.I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the needs of people who work on this floor.   The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the foundation of analyzing energy problems.   The course is loosely based on a graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently published.This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being offered.   As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.   Chris Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity to take this course between now and the end of the year.   We have selected a cross-section of people for this first session.   Some people have a lot of experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.   Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others are new to the business.   We are hoping that the course will be helpful to people with different backgrounds.   Each participant in the class is not only responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course better.   You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide feedback.   This feedback is part of the program.   If you aren't willing or don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list for this session.Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the next course is offered in a month or so.   With your help, we will be able to improve the training for the people who come after you.   Thanks in advance for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.Tim Belden\n"

      "body": "\nBased on a discussion I had with Tim, we should report out-of-market transactions with the FERC and should not question the ISO about their reporting out-of-market transactions for the following reasons:Even though the Commission's order referred only to bids into the ISO, it was not artfully written.   Otherwise FERC would not get any reporting information necessary for refunds.We have always said that out-of-market should be more transparent and more liquid.   As long as this information is withheld from the market, these goals will not be achieved.Nor will the Commission's goal of moving volumes out of the spot market be achieved if parties can simply withhold from the spot market and sell out-of-market without FERC scrutiny.\n"

        " Mary Hain/HOU/ECT on 03/16/20001 12:45 PM --- \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   \"Ronald Carroll\" &lt;rcarroll@bracepatt.com&lt;   03/16/20001 12:15 PM To: &lt;Mary.Hain@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: Revised RCR for PGE RFP:   $5,000Mary,   I looked into your idea regarding using an index price approach along the lines of the tariff that was approved for EPMI's market based sales to PGE in Docket No. ER999-364-000.   I agree that the current situation is quite similar to that.   thus, since the current proposal is similar to one that has already been accepted, the matter is less controversial than I originally thought and I do not think that this would entail much additional research.   Nor do I think that we necessarily need to pre-screen this with FERC since that would delay the filing.   I would therefore revise my RCR projection to $5,000 to prepare the filing and suggest that we simply file it.   (I would let you know if I think it is more complicated once I dig in.)FYI, I ran this through Dan, and he agrees with the foregoing.   As before, however, we cannot get FERC approval within the time frame contemplated by the RFP.   I agree with you that the conservative and preferable (from a legal/regulatory perspective) way to proceed is to make your proposal to PGE subject to FERC approval.   Since time is of the essence, let me know when to begin, and we'll jump on it right away.   Ron&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;Mary.Hain@enron.com&lt; 03/13/01 12:48PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Portland General Electric (PGE) has a request for proposals (RFP) that EPMIwants to submit an offer on.   PGE is essentially seeking a fixed price for50-2000 MW 'round the clock for five years starting in '02 at Portland'ssystem, the Mid-C, or COB South to North.   Offers are due by March 28 andPGE has until April 5, 20001 to accept .I have told Mike that any deal with PGE has to be approved by FERC underthe terms of EPMI's market based rate tariff.   I have also told him thatEPMI could either make the offer subject to FERC approval or take theregulatory risk that FERC would in some way change the benefits of anycontract in PGE's favor.   I would recommend the former.   Ron - would youtell me how much you would charge to draft a FERC filing, for my review,in the event PGE accepts our offer?   Jim - I intend to submit an RCR forthis FERC filing.   Is that okay?\n"

These are the real-time and short-term markets, respectively.   By the terms of the December 15 order, the cap does not apply to any bilateral transactions, including sales to the California Dept. of Water Resources (CDWR), which are generally for longer terms.Given the instability of the California market, the current applicability of the cap may change in the future.   In a recentlly released report, FERC staff recommends that the cap be discontinued after April 20001 and replace by a series of other measures to mitigate market power.   Thes include a marginal cost price cap on sales into the ISO by sellers who are party to the participating generator agreement.Although unlikely, it is not inconceivable that someone in the future might argue that the role currently being performed by CDWR is in some respects the same role as was formerly performed by the PX.   Based on that proposiiton, it might be argued that a price cap similar to the \"soft price\" cap   be imposed on sales to the CDWR.\n"

In the transcript she refers toanother chart --- one that supposedly shows \"outrageously excessive profitsby traders.\"   It would appear that we have the wrong chart.   The missingchart is also the one referred to in Chairman Hoecker's questions to Enron.Could you try again to locate this profit chart and get it to us as soon aspossible.   We need it to evaluate the proposed responses.ThanksGary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts back to the generators first.   It also claims that the PX could not suspend its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.   It asks the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero.I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and (2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed in the auction.   Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it?What is the significance of setting the market clearing price at zero? \n"

While too much should never be read into a grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are asking the Court to expand the native load exception.   It should also be noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.   Enron's brief is due in 45 days.   Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next week to get this process started.

(The Court declined other questions?New York?had   raised.)? The Court also granted the petition of Enron Power Marketing,   Inc. (EPMI v. FERC, No. 000-809) to consider whether FERC has jurisdiction to   regulate all transmission in interstate commerce, including transmission for   bundled retail sales, and whether FERC is obligated under the Federal Power Act   to eliminate undue discrimination by requiring transmission-owning utilities to   provide service on the same terms to all users, including bundled retail   sales.? The cases will be argued together, probably not before October   20001.\n"

Amy Fitzpatrick will provide you with a course outline and background reading (helpful but not mandatory) by Monday morning.   We want to have 15 people attend this course.   I realize that this is short notice, so if you can't attend please let me know ASAP so that I can find a replacement.I have been working with Jon Koomey, who will be teaching the course, over the last couple of months to tailor a training session that will meet the needs of people who work on this floor.   The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of computations and analytical tools that are the foundation of analyzing energy problems.   The course is loosely based on a graduate level course offered at Berkeley (which Jon has taught and several people on the floor have taken) and on a book that Jon Koomey recently published.This is the first time that this course, in its current form, is being offered.   As a result, it should be viewed as a work in progress.   Chris Calger and I would like every person in this office to have the opportunity to take this course between now and the end of the year.   We have selected a cross-section of people for this first session.   Some people have a lot of experience doing analysis while others have little training in this area.   Some have been working in the energy industry for several years while others are new to the business.   We are hoping that the course will be helpful to people with different backgrounds.   Each participant in the class is not only responsible for learning as much as you can, but is also required to give constructive feedback to Jon Koomey and to us on how to make the course better.   You will have both formal and informal opportunities to provide feedback.   This feedback is part of the program.   If you aren't willing or don't feel that you have the time to take this one-day course and provide us with thoughtful, constructive suggestions on how to improve the course for the next time please let me know and your name will be removed from the list for this session.Based on the feedback from this course, we will make modifications before the next course is offered in a month or so.   With your help, we will be able to improve the training for the people who come after you.   Thanks in advance for your help with this, and I hope that you find this training to be helpful.Tim Belden\n"

      "body": "\nWe are trying to get long term transmission service from Sierra Pacific for LV Cogen.   Sierra Pacific claims that numerous parties are ahead of us in the queue.   We disagree (for some fairly complex technical reasons that I won't detail here).   Sierra Pacific won't offer us transmission service until it resolves the requests that are ahead of us in the queue.   At this time, we are planning to keep the project and may have difficulty getting financing if we can't get the transmission service.   It is my understanding that we have exhausted all negotiating opportunities with Sierra to resolve this issue.   I would like to have Bracewell and Patterson draft a FERC filing to resolve this issue.   However, I have been told that EPMI cannot make such a filing due to the pending merger.Paul and Sarah - I'd like to confirm that we have indeed exhausted all negotiating opportunities and that we can't file anything against Sierra.\n"

For 3rd quarter we'll need to undergo an examination of our reporting requirements for WSPP and accordingly, our reporting processes.   The filing requirements can be found under the \" WSPP Library\" heading of the Current Documents section of the WSPP home page (ww.wspp.org).Basically, we just need to be confident our reports are accurate and we also need to be cognizant that if we make significant changes, we should be able to anticipate the impact of those changes and send appropriate adjusting notification if necessary.   Let's not surprise ourselves or FERC in a big way!I'm not sure that I am the appropriate staff to head this up, but will be happy to provide organization and coordination to the effort until we all are happy with the undertaking.Next week after the close of this month is complete, I will structure a project management file on the WSPP reporting and we'll take it from there.   Please contact me with comments, questions, complaints, x77756.P.S.We have filed the 2nd quarter report using the unchanged method.\n"
