As most of you know we have had significant issues with El Paso regarding their willingness to cooperate in the monetization of the Mesquite Notes we were to receive in the transaction.   The worst issues have revolved around the structure and strength of the El Paso parent contingent guarantee and the structure and necessary Mesquite and El Paso disclosures required to monetize the Notes.   Accordingly we made a proposal to El Paso on Wednesday of last week to change the fundamental structure of the transaction.   Our proposal was to have El Paso provide us with a commodity contract under ISDA documents (but without a collateral threshold) and the usual unconditional parent guarantee that was \"in the money\" with payment terms identical to the deferred payments we were to receive under the Mesquite Notes.   El Paso obtained the necessary clearances for such a transaction Friday night.   We now expect to pursue this structure instead of the more difficult 1444A monetization.   I have attached a Transaction Summary and a transaction diagram to help explain the specific of our proposal.   In addition, I have attached a revised offer analysis; we now expect slightly lower monetization costs.With the 1444A issues off the table we believe that we will now be able to sign a Transaction Agreement by the end of next week.   We also expect it to be much easier to satisfy by year end the resulting shorter list of conditions precedent to closing.There have been some other minor changes the most significant of which is that Merlin will not be selling its $30mm of SubNotes as part of this transaction.   Please call if you have any questions.\n"

We are still waiting on a couple of responses. I won't namenames. You know who you are.Please also review the attached e-mail from Patricia Hogan at Goldman Sachsregarding the appropriate Platt's references. She suggests that the Platt'sreference in each definition should be to the version of Platt's that ispublished in the relevant region. Please let me know as soon as possiblewhether you agree with her suggestion. If you agree with her suggestion,which I believe is largely mechanical, I would ask that those who tookresponsiblity for a particular commodity let us know the proper Platt'sreference for the commodity and delivery point. Otherwise, we will assumethat Tricia's suggestions should be followed.I look forward to wrapping up this project in the next ten days, so pleaserespond promptly.Bob Pickel---Original Message---From: Hogan, Patricia [mailto:patricia.hogan@gs.com]Sent: Monday, December 27, 1999 12:07 PMTo: 'rpickel@isda.org'; kellis@cravath.comCc: 'Corrinne Greasley'; Marcus, Aaron; Prince, KeirSubject: 1999 Supplement to the 19993 Commodity Derivatives Definitions We have reviewed the Reference Price Sources for the commoditiesthat have been assigned to us.   I will forward our changes, amendments andupdates under separate cover. In the course of reviewing the Price Sources, we came across oneissue that was not discussed on the recent conference call, but is one aboutwhich we have strong feelings.   We believe that the Price Source used for aparticular commodity should reflect the geographic source of the commodity,e.g., Platt's Asia-Pacific for Asian commodities, Platt's European,Marketscan or Platt's Crude Marketwire for European commodities and Platt'sOilgram for North American commodities.   While reviewing the Reference PriceSources for Fuel Oil, we found that in many cases only Platt's Oilgram islisted, even though the product is European or Asian.   We would prefer todelete the references to Platt's Oilgram for products outside of NorthAmerica.   However, we understand that such a step cannot be taken without adiscussion with the wider group (which may not be feasible at this point).If such a discussion is not feasible, we would like (if possible) to includethe European or Asian-Pacific price source in the Supplement along with theU.S. price source for all products (including those commodities we have notreviewed and commented on). I apologize for bringing this issue up so late in the process.Please call me, Keir Prince (0111 444 171 7774 50004) or Aaron Marcus (357-9514)if you would like to discuss.&lt;   ___&lt;&lt;   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.&lt;   One New York Plaza, 37th Floor | New York,   NY   10004&lt;   Tel:   212-357-2751   |   Fax:   212-428-3597&lt;   email:   patricia.hogan@gs.com&lt;&lt;&lt;   Patricia L.

Good news is that they consider that they will be able to pass a law that redifines netting on the bankrupcy law by year end. They assume that they will have \"media sanci?n\" before mid December. Media sanci?n is basically having approval by one of the chambers (Diputados) and a strong support to going to the Senators Chamber shortly after. We will receive the law project today. The law project was designed by Hector Alegria. Gustavo assumes that they will be available to talking with our legal team upon request.They have received from the Central Bank a request to propose all necessary changes in the regulations so as to have the (interest rate mainly) derivatives market going asap. This shows a fertile ground on this institution for our future conversations. On the CNV's side, he stated that the porject of law (on netting) was actively supported by this body. ACtually, he commented that CNV officials were active speakers when this matter was treated in the commission session at Congress.ADA is working with PWC on the tax issues. ADA and PWC are preparing to present the government officials their proposal for the Ingresos Brutos treatment of derivatives in the City of Buenos Aires (makes me think that we have been talking to the right guys these last days).Gustavo was crystal clear that, although they have been supported and funded by banks, they are a Foundation and they are open to working with Enron. He insisted that he does not expect conflict of interest to arise and that the energy sector is strategical for them, specially considering the recent evolution in financial energy trading.There will be some issues regarding the support ADA will give to the Rofex effort of creating an energy market. The OTC versus the formal exchange issue is to be addressed.ADA is willing to work with us on the future and we might have to do some follow up meetings to get this type of news earlier.My personal opinion is that we might like to go ahead with our conversations with regulators and officials but I doubt whether we should go with ADA or not. There are various pros and cons.Lets talk for 5 minutes,Bernardo\n"

To complete=\r a=20\rplan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20\rintegrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst &amp; Young (CGEY) at=\r=20\rtheir Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20\r I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig=\rn=20\rsession.   This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t=\rh=20\rin Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called =\ra=20\rDesignShop=01v.   It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos=\red of=20\rvarious modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you=\r=20\rhave not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20\rregard this session as different from any working session you have previous=\rly=20\rexperienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven=\r=20\rto be very successful.   Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20\rmethodology on this very critical and strategic venture.\r A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.   You were=\r=20\rselected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=\re=20\rDesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=\r=20\rlittle distraction or interruption as possible.   The quality of our results=\r=20\rdepends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=\r=20\rentire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=\rt=20\rand communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =\r=20\rThis date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=\ro=20\rthat your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20\rnecessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=\r=20\rthese two days.\r Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=\r=20\rand transportation.   Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=\r=20\rhas also been included.   You may direct any additional questions concerning=\r=20\rthe event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.\r I hope that you will be able to participate.   Please confirm your attendanc=\re=20\rfor the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:000=\r=20\rp.m.   If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone=\r=20\relse to participate.   Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to=\r=20\rtake your place until you and I have discussed this.\r I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo=\ru=20\rin Dallas!\r \n"

As you will noteon the agenda attached below, we have placed the Legal Department at the top of the agenda after the introduction to discuss \"Legal Implications of the Electronic Marketplace\".This discussion should conceivably include discussions of the following topics:   Electronic signatures (in particular EnronOnline)Websites for delivery and executing confirmations (Commodity Logic)See \"XII Future Trends\" on Page 4 of the agendaPlease let me know as soon as possible if this will be possible.   As you can see, this is a very importanttopic for us.   Call me if I can help clarify any points.   One other point - I am assuming that you guys are the head guys for financial and physical legal decision making for Houston, Calgary and London.   For your information, there may be some lawyer types coming from the LondonGlobal Markets group.Also, JAD means Joint Accelerated Development.---",

        " Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 09/15/2000 06:14 PM ---\tPeter Keohane\tSent by: Sharon Crawford\t09/15/2000 05:39 PM \t\t\t To: Soma Ghosh/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Clement Abrams/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Derek Davies/CAL/ECT@ECT, Andre Templeman/CAL/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: dpef@blakes.com\t\t\t Subject: Alberta PPA FinancingI thought I might try to sum up.   It seems to me that we both need to finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of next week.1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap structure including the credit and covenant package.2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have one prepared.   Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.   Frankly, unless and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations are, it is difficult if not   impossible to prepare documentation.   For example: (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee they were expecting from Enron Corp.   I was trying to require the Bank to accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.   Based upon this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may have a problem to resolve.   However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank. (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.   However, I now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law. &amp;copy; In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable. (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to Enron Canada.   Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon is prepared to provide those legal opinions. (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.   I suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable. (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed. (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.   This presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.   At the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be capable of being set-off.   We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements. (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent upon a final understanding of the swap structure. (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap structure.   Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate \"fee letter\" to recover its fees.   More problematically, the Bank was not clear as to how \"increased costs\" would be accounted for in the swap structure.   Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those increased costs are flowed through.   They were not sure how this could be accommodated in a swap structure.   I suggested that there may be some way to fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes or through a separate indemnification in the \"fee letter\". (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.   For example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the Bank in connection with the transaction.   Of course this depends on finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants package.   In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper as soon as possible.   Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external expectations.   It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday morning.Regards,Peter\n"

Imagine that the self-declared winner lost the popular vote but won&lt; based on some old colonial holdover (electoral college) from the&lt; nation's pre-democracy past.&lt;&lt; 3. Imagine that the self-declared winner's 'victory' turned on disputed&lt; votes cast in a province governed by his brother!&lt;&lt; 4. Imagine that the poorly drafted ballots of one district, a district&lt; heavily favoring the self-declared winner's opponent, led thousands of&lt; voters to vote for the wrong candidate.&lt;&lt; 5. Imagine that that members of that nation's most despised caste,&lt; fearing for their lives/livelihoods, turned out in record numbers to&lt; vote in near-universal opposition to the self-declared winner's&lt; candidacy.&lt;&lt; 6. Imagine that hundreds of members of that most-despised caste were&lt; intercepted on their way to the polls by state police operating under&lt; the authority of the self-declared winner's brother.&lt;&lt; 7. Imagine that six million people voted in the disputed province and&lt; that the self-declared winner's 'lead' was only 327 votes. Fewer,&lt; certainly, than the vote counting machines' margin of error.&lt;&lt; 8. Imagine that the self-declared winner and his political party opposed&lt;&lt; a more careful by-hand inspection and re- counting of the ballots in the&lt;&lt; disputed province or in its most hotly disputed district.&lt;&lt; 9. Imagine that the self-declared winner, himself a governor of a major&lt; province, had the worst human rights record of any province in his&lt; nation and actually led the nation in executions.&lt;&lt; 10. Imagine that a major campaign promise of the self- declared winner&lt; was to appoint like-minded human rights violators to lifetime positions&lt; on the high court of that nation.&lt;&lt; None of us would deem such an election to be representative of anything&lt; other than the self-declared winner's will-to- power. All of us, I&lt; imagine, would wearily turn the page thinking that it was another sad&lt; tale of pitiful pre- or anti-democracy peoples in some strange&lt; elsewhere.\"&lt;\n"

I agree completely re: the need for a procedure.   Let me know what you think about the following:1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards the name to Credit.   At the same time, the commercial team should be identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).   2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).   If approved, Credit notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron relationships.3. Legal conducts a \"screening\" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the appropriate level of further review.   If the commercial team considers the RE the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.   In addition, if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the \"other Enron relationships\" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.   Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on the website.   Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

Aquilia Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.   To ensure timely payment, Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk will be made by Aquilia Southwest.   Aquilia wanted us to change the counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed.   Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues.   Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the effort to getting the invoices to the correct office.   I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.   I would like clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for Physical deals.   Thanks,KC\n"

We issued seperate ID's to accomadate this however they have traded physical this am with KN Trading.   I discussed this with KN (Shawn Magovern) and he expressed great frustration with the idea of running seperate machines or web sessions.   Shawn asked us to consider what options might be available downstream.   His comment was that they will just have to turn the system off and that brokers understand their business and apply the company name appropriately.   I explained to Shawn that he can control the access of his traders and avoid issues in the future however it does require them to transact under the appropriate ID.   Can we develop some form of agreement that would allow us to \"automatically\" assign transaction according to some strict guidelines (I know this is like a Power of Attorney)?   Can we look at systematic enhancements in the future which would allow for contractual arrangements based on the product?I would like to get back with Shawn if we can suggest any other options.\n"

It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will be conducted.   Is that correct?   Any suggestions/comments?Mark---"

In order to kick things off I suggest we concentrate on the background areas which predominantly will be run by legal.   The teams involved in the project so far include the US and Europe - where the jurisdictional issues have all been handled are listed at the bottom of this note for information but I am to a certain extent assuming that legal is run from the US rather than Europe for Australia (I have left a voicemail with Alan Aronowitz to chat it through with him).   I would like Mark to co-ordinate the work with David and start off immediately - please let me know if there are nay problems with this.   From my group Dave Forster and myself will be points of contact at this stage bringing in more resources as soon as we get the background things rolling.But firstly we need an idea of what will be traded in Australia, from our discussions I am assuming Power, Coal and Weather - is that right?Background:(i)   Due diligence from a regulatory perspective(ii)   Legal review on the framework of our site in its appropriateness to the market .

By Mandy Bryan.e-StrategyAs electricity retailers prepare for deregulation, Ergon Energy chief Kim Griffith is looking to the internet for competitive advantage.Around this time next year, NSW and Victorian consumers will be able to choose their own electricity suppliers, ushering in a period of massive change for Australia's 30 electricity retailers.Among them will be Queensland's Ergon Energy, which now services 5550,000 customers and earns 50 per cent of its revenue from the consumer market.Ergon chief executive Kim Griffith has chosen to make the internet a key part of his survival plan as he jostles for mind share.\"There really isn't an established way of doing this because electricity has always been a monopoly and suddenly 10 million contestible customers will appear in an industry that is probably turning over $10 billion in sales a year,\" he says.While studies show Australian utilities are lagging behind overseas counterparts in moving operations online, Ergon Energy is considered to be at the forefront of internet adoption by an Australian utility.Ergon's website allows customers to connect and disconnect their electricity service and submit complaints and enquiries.\"If you look at electricity retail, it is fundamentally an information-based business and we will survive based on the information we can gather about customers,\" says Griffith.He also hopes that by 20001 customers will also be able to pay their bills and select from more flexible pricing billing arrangements, as well as buy products and services online.\"The internet is an obvious way of doing business because it also allows you to increase interaction with customers at an appropriate cost. We are now selling a commodity with low margins, so a cost-effective channel to market is key.\"The $3 to $4 cost of over-the-counter transactions is more than 10 times the cost of an internet transaction, Griffith says.As electricity margins shrink, he says Ergon will increasingly diversify into non-electricity and electricity-related services and products.\"We are looking to add value and differentiate in areas other than price. We are releasing a number of products into our domestic market related to electricity and electricity consumption such as energy-efficient light bulbs,\" he says.\"The next big challenge I've put to my people is to put significant product on to the site and to generate real revenue.\"But he acknowledges that winning in this market is not as simple as being first on the web.Ergon faces competition not only from traditional electricity retailers but also nimble virtual electricity brokers such as Exco Energy (ww.exco.com.au) and possibly banks and supermarkets. Woolworths, for instance, has flagged an interest in electricity retailing.Yet Griffith believes that these same organisations also present opportunities to utilities given the reach of their established customer bases.\"If you look at electricity, and particularly the mass market, there really isn't a channel to market,\" Griffith says. \"In the future, companies will be out there trying to create national brands as well as looking to alliances with established brands and channels to markets.\"In addition to seeking such alliances, Ergon is building up its own customer database to hold and analyse the information it gathers from its website.\"Each time a customer hits our website, we can gather more information and continue to build business based on that information.\"For the time being, though, the major challenge lies in drawing people to its site.\"We are offering a number of freebies on our site to get people used to visiting it,\" he says.Ergon also has comprehensive educational information on its site relevant to the school curriculum which it is building up into a full virtual power station tour.\"If we want people to keep visiting, we have to keep increasing the value of the site to existing and potential customers,\" Griffith says.\"There are two groups, the ones that will not want to change suppliers in 20001 and those that do, and they are the people who will be on board with technology.\"Copyright John Fairfax Holdings Limited 1999.

      "body": "\nI've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take beginners.   I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier thread.   I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby.   The only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't quite ready.   I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I know.   They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10.   If you use their provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there right on time.   Having several people (but not too many) around this time is helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc.   Of course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done on time.   Check with your charter company about attending the briefings before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may require 2 people from your boat to attend.As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight on Norman Island.   There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as long as you're not in too late.   It shouldn't take more than a few hours to get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the engine.   There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, there is at least very little ashore to bother you.   The caves are just around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving either that afternoon or first thing the next day.Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter.   My advice running roughly clockwise: skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless you're clearing customs); skip the USVI - all the clearing out &amp; in &amp; out &amp; in can take a lot of time and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your trash on board - there's nowhere to put it); Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little Harbor - Sydney's Peace &amp; Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor bar where you mix your own drinks &amp; just keep track in his little black book while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food &amp; drinks;   Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop and a swim; don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the channel in is well marked; if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back; it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met that way; the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones reserved for commercial craft;   I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is?); the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there (10 cents a gal.?).   Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be able to see everything).   The only difficulty might be if you need to get the boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay to take a taxi to the early flight &amp; then sailed around to have the boat back well before noon.   Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely.   And just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat - many of them can get quite crowded.   Of course, if you're going anytime between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds - just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts!Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season.   A few of the islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers either.   But snorkeling and diving are everywhere.   Ask at your chart briefing for the best spots these days.   If you have divers along, don't miss the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and bring along equipment and a guide for the divers.   The cruising guide will have lots of info on all these issues.Wish I was going - it's always a blast!\n"

      "body": "\nEnron rings opening bell for bandwidth   exchange   By Corey Grice   Staff Writer, CNET News.com   December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT   The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange. The currency? Bandwidth.   A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today opened the   doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange. The company first announced its intention to   sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May.   Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like oil, natural   gas and grain. Enron has taken this concept and given it a   telecommunications spin, offering space on high-speed   networks to communications carriers.   In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or service gaps in   their networks would have had to enter long-term contracts   with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth needs. The   exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman for   carriers to find short-term contracts or quick fixes as they   complete network construction or try to manage   heavier-than-expected network traffic.   For example, Global Crossing plans to sell capacity on a   high-speed fiber optic link between New York and Los   Angeles over the exchange.   Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market next May.   Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its own   commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New York today.   RateXchange predicts that the trading of bandwidth and other telecommunications products   could become a $8 billion market by 20002. \n"

I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.   I'm not sure you are aware of the importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed revisions.   We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the outcome this time around.   Are you the right person in your shop for us to talk to about this?   If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.Thanks,Mark\n"

We haveincluded both the annotated and unannotated versions, as well as ablackline showing changes from yesterday's version. The only changes are(1) an addition in the definition of master netting agreement on page 3334relating to guarantees and reimbursement obligations in respect of suchagreements, which we understand is acceptable to Mike Krimminger at theFDIC, (2) the deletion of an incorrect section numbering change on page351, and (3) the insertion of a revised \"placeholder\" provision on page 348relating to rulemaking by the SEC and CFTC to address the treatment ofsecurity futures products and joint securities/futures accounts in theinsolvency context.   As we have mentioned, the placeholder is intended tobe replaced by substantive language following further discussions betweenthe SEC and CFTC (and would presumably be removed if the agencies do notagree on substantive language).   Although we have discussed the substanceof the new placeholder provision with the SEC and CFTC, the SEC has not yetsigned off on the specific language.   We understand that although the CFTCdoes not \"endorse\" the placeholder language, it does not object to itsinclusion as a placeholder for this purpose.Please feel free to call Seth Grosshandler (at 212-2225-2542) or me (at212-2225-22234) with any questions or comments regarding the attached.Geoffrey B.

Senator Schumer offered an amendment reflecting the majority ofour amendment package.   The Schumer Amendment was adopted except forprovisions relating to Section 708 which received objection by SenatorGrassley.   Schumer's staff indicated they will attempt to work this outw/Grassley before floor consideration tomorrow.House Activity - The House Rules Committee made in order the Oxley-LaFalceamendment, which reflects the majority of our netting amendment package.Better news is that the amendment is alloted only 10 minutes of debate.Note that the Financial Services Committee was not able to get language onSection 708 and the SEC savings language included in the legislation due toobjection by the House Judiciary Committee. The amendment will be offered onthe House floor tomorrow.   Attached is the Oxley Amendment filed with theRules Committee and the letter we circulated to Chairman Drier, HouseLeadership, and contacts on the Financial Services, Judiciary andAgriculture Committees.   The SEC issue prevented release of our letterearlier because they would not authorize PWG agreement without the savingsclause language.   They were convinced to withdraw their objection on apromise that the Financial Services Committee would work to get thislanguage adopted in conference. Additionally, we understand that ChairmanSensenbrenner may grumble about the Oxley amendment but will not raise anyformal objection.To the extent you are able I would recommend sharing our letter with anycontacts you have with Members that are inclined to be involved intomorrow's debate and are inclined to be helpful --- particularly those onthe Financial Services and Judiciary Committees.Note:   Due to the SEC snafu we were not able to circulate the letter to theSenate today.   We are attempting to rework the letter to reflect the Schumeramendment in hope that it still may be useful tomorrow. - HR333_0002.PDF - Netting Amendments.doc\n"

SFA have accepted our argument that our proprietary bond and equity trading can be carried on in London through an unregulated UK entity.   The letter also states that SFA will not be applying their consolidated capital supervision rules to the unregulated entity, which they have the discretion to do.From a regulatory perspective this means we can move ahead at full speed to set up an appropriate Chinese Wall and then begin trading.Best regardsPaul\n"

The Market Rules were still being discussed and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), ANEEL issued Resolution 290/000, approving the Market Rules, subject to certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better idea of the schedule.I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further assistance.AndreaFrom: Mark Taylor@ECT on 08/14/2000 05:57 PM CDTTo: Andrea Bertone/SA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: EnronOnlineAny progress on the EnronOnline front?

Just to summarise, we are negotiating the purchase of 3MW for 30 days to sell it to an industrial customer.I spoke with Andrea Bertone (our internal legal counsel) and we thought that the most efficient way to develop the contracts between Enron, the seller and the purchaser of power would be to use the model of contracts that Enron currently applies for the electricity trading transaction in the US, and then adapt them considering the commercial conditions of the deal as well as the Brazilian regulatory aspects. Therefore, I would like to ask you to send us a copy of such contracts, and since the power will be available on 01 April, I would really appreciate if you could send them asap.Thanks and regards,Marcelo Parodiphone: 555111 55503-12229\n"

Preliminaryreports indicate that agreement on 7 of the 34 issues was made earlier inthe afternoon.   It is unclear what the 7 items were, however, the meetingbroke in order for Gramm's staff to brief the Senator on developments.   Whenthe meeting resumed Gramm's staff reportedly backed off the prioragreements.   In sum, no progress was made at the end of the day.   The staffsagreed to meet again tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. (On an side note SenatorGramm's staff indicated that only a handful of banks supported the bill)We also participated on a conference call with the AdHoc Coalition and theChicago Futures Exchanges held by Tom Ewing this afternoon.   Ewing advisedthat he had a discussion with Speaker Hastert who is well aware of theimportance of this issue. He encouraged all of us to make renewed appeals tothe House and Senate leadership and as many Senate contacts as possible.In my estimation, tomorrow will likely be our last opportunity to have anysort of impact on Senate activity.   At the end of the day we will eitherhave a deal or negotiations will have failed.   I would suggest making thefollowing contacts tomorrow morning with a simple message:   1) We are awarethat the staffs are continuing to work on resolution of outstanding issues.2) It is vitally important that these issues be resolved and that passage ofthe legislation occur this year.My recommendation would be to deliver this message to the followingentities:1.   Senator Gramm --- since his staff is under the impression that only ahandful of banks support the bill.2.   Senator Leadership --- Lott and Nickels3.   Senate Agriculture Committee Members - Republican and Democrats4.   Senate Banking Committee Members - Republican and Democrats5.   House Leadership - Hastert, Delay and Armey* Calls to Lugar are not necessaryFinally, I am of the firm belief that this legislation stands a worse if anychance of enactment next year.We need to give this our best shot tomorrow!Many thanks!Stacy CareyDirector North American Regulatory PolicyInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association(202) 457-6545 ph(703) 256-18333 fax(917) 543-96222 cellscarey@isda.org\n"

Fred Lagrasta is now also supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make (I don't know if he needs any audio/visual equipment).   Can you check on this - maybe somebody else in Jeff Keeler's, Steve Kean's, or maybe even Ken Rice's office will know where this is supposed to take place?   It is entirely possible that no one has reserved a room yet.   If you could do that and then let the attendees know where it will be, I'd appreciate it.

Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their operations manager, Joseph Glace.   The counterparty is contending that the broker confirm is correct.   Trading contends our confirm is correct and binding.   How should we proceed?   The value of the position is roughly $3MM of revenue.Thanks,WK\n"

At least that is what our deal ticket indicated.   Conectiv/Delmarva disagreed vehemently, contending that they were the buyer and we were the seller.Last week I obtained the tapes from the broker, Natsource.   I previously forwarded the tapes to you.   The tapes unequivocally indicate that we were the seller.   In fact, the tapes reflect that we sold two Nov '000 - March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 contracts at the same time --- one to Conectiv/Delmarva and one to Duke.   We have gone back and checked our records to see if we actually sold a Nov '000 - March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 contract to Duke at the same time we entered into a deal with Conectiv/Delmarva.   We did.   Notwithstanding the clear language on the tape, it would be hard to explain with a straight face why we would sell a swap to Duke and buy a swap from Conectiv/Delmarva at the same time.After the trade, Natsource sent us a confirmation, indicating that we were the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva was the buyer.   Although we sent Conectiv/Delmarva a confirm (and they signed it) reflecting that we were the buyer and they were the seller, we settled the swap for the first two months as if we were the seller and they were the buyer.The long and short of it is that, from a legal standpoint, there is no question whatsoever that the intention of the parties was that Enron would be the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva would be the buyer.   This is not even a close call.   It is my advice that we should settle the trade as if we are the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva is the buyer, and move on.\n"

All bank charges and other fees, commissions, costs and expenses incurred with respect to furnishing security to [Enron] shall be for the account of [Counterparty].\"The second paragraph provides a remedy for contracts involving   physical deliveries, but   requires some re-working to provide Enron the right to terminate specific contracts with a counterparty for trades which are purely financial contracts, if the Counterparty failed to provide adequate security in suggested time frame.   Please call if you have any questions.RegardsDavid\n"

The position of CDs under Swedish law can be summarised as follows.1.   RegulationCDs are regulated in Sweden in the same way as commodity derivatives. As discussed we are currently working through these issues as they relate to commodity derivatives with local counsel and I will be pressing them to take a less cautious approach than they have taken to date (particularly in light of our expanding presence in Sweden). As you know, our target is to avoid Swedish licencing requirements and the accompanying regulatory capital requirements. In the meantime, this uncertainty will not prevent us from dealing in Norway with Swedish parties based in Norway.2.   InsuranceCDs are not analysed as contracts of insurance under Swedish law.3.   Guarantees   CDs are not analysed as contracts of guarantee under Swedish law.4.   GamingCDs are not analysed as gaming contracts under Swedish law and (unusually) we do not even need to go so far as to satisfy ourselves that the contract is being entered into by the counterparty for a valid commercial purpose (i e hedging).   However, it should be noted that several types of entity may not enter derivatives at all for speculative purposes (e g municipalities, insurance companies).5.   ConfidentialityThis could be an issue for Enron even where we are selling the CD, where we have good reason to believe there is breach of the purchaser's duty of confidentiality owed to the reference credit (i e where we are not in good faith). The position would of course be potentially more problematical where we are purchasing the CD.   That said, it would be difficult in either case for the reference credit to establish loss (e g   damage to reputation), so it would be hard for them to launch a claim.   Our exposure could be restricted further by passing on no more information about underlying reference contracts than is absolutely necessary.   I am pusuing this further with Clifford Chance, in particular to find out what the practice is in the London and New York credit derivative markets where the issue of confidentaility arises and I will revert to you when I have more information. Perhaps Merrills could shed some light on this?6.   Subrogation &amp; AssignmentSince CDs are not guarantees there is no right of subrogation.   It is possible to take an assignment of the counterparty's rights against the reference credit, but this will not work so as to allow Enron a right of set off against the reference credit where Enron is aware of the reference credit's insolvency at the time of the assignment (a reasonable bet) or where the latter becomes bankrupt within three months of the assignment.   In effect, this will make it very difficult indeed to extract any value at all (including by way of set off) from the reference credit.Please feel free to call me on x 65666 to discuss this and to pass this note on to other interested staff.Best regardsPaul\n"

Under the terms of the credit product, on the occurrence of   a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely change the analysis below.)Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more significant legal issues.   I am also attaching a two page \"Executive Summary of Legal Advice\" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on issues we raised which are \"all clear\" from a legal perspective, so as to keep the summary to a sensible length   (but there was plenty of good news too!).   Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.A.   Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, USB.   Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be delayed Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)C.   General Issues (applicable in all countries)The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks of a general nature:(i)   Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional documents before allowing them to trade the product online.   This applies to almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in all countries.   Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their constitutional documents if they wish to trade).   The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading relationship and so can be added to our procedures.   It is not a particularly onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.(ii)   Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure that we are not misusing confidential information about our business counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.   Misuse can occur both in pricing the product and trading it.   The procedures will not include formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US counsel following very detailed discussions).   The procedures will include (a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.   In addition, where Enron has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.   Without such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that entity for breach of confidence.D.   Country Specific Issues(i)   Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the product unenforceable against our counterparties.   We should try to resolve this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in Canada.   Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.(ii)   Germany -   Again the issue is insurance.   The risk is higher than in Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.(ii)   Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and unenforceable.   The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a \"substantial professional effort\" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.   At a minimum, we should therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic behind its trading this product type.(iv)   Switzerland -   If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being unclear).   If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty (which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.   However, I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.(v)   US (New York Law) (a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under the US Commodities Exchange Act. (b)   US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product constitutes a \"security\" under US securities laws (please see attached Executive Summary).   However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of securities to \"accredited investors\" which will allow us to deal with investors having at least US$5 million in assets.   Since most of our counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should not impede the business.&amp;copy;   Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security (see (b) above) is relatively remote.---Please feel free to call me on x365666 if you would like to discuss this project further.Best regardsPaul\n"

      "body": "\nThanks for your note - hope you have time for a little fun while you're in SF - or at least some good food.The Moorings said they should be able to put your part on the credit card if you want.   Their number is 8000-535-7289; our contract number is 507645 and it's under my name.   The guy I talked to said he'll have to call during regular business hours when the bookkeeping department is open.   Each person's share is currently $905.333.   That includes one night in the Moorings hotel so will go down by 555.50 or so if you decide not to stay there at all.   Beverages are covered by a separate payment.   I'll be glad to fax the invoice when you get a number for me.   If you want to send me your check, that's fine, or Bruce can do it - makes no difference to me.Regarding \"connectedness,\"   there were no internet cafes the last time I was there.   While that may have changed, there won't be more than one or two in the entire place, I'm sure.   Were you planning on bringing your laptop?   If so, it would make sense to find a 12 volt charger cable that will plug into a lighter socket or bring extra batteries - we won't have 1110 volt current on the boat except the first - and maybe one other - night.   It will be easy to check voice mails since we will have a cell phone on board.   But it's not cheap (as I remember it it was $1/min. to receive a call from the States and $2/min. to place one) and I'm reasonably comfortable that you won't be able to plug into it.   I'm not sure if your US cell phone will work there or not.   We can find out from the Moorings.   I have an international cell phone I'm bringing along that also has infrared capability.   Does your laptop have one of those ir receivers?   If so, I can bring along the software you need to work it with this phone.   Not to be defeatist and I'm sure the times have changed but I remember one trip 7 or 8 years ago where a friend needed to receive &amp; send some faxes so we stopped at a little island hotel and asked if we could use their fax machine - they said yes but had never seen anyone send or receive more than a 2 or 3 page fax before and our 50 and 60 pagers soon ran the machine out of paper.   When we asked for more paper it turns out we had used the last piece on the island - they were not amused.   Ted asked me to remind you to be thinking about music.   Let me just add in the spirit of self-preservation that it's a good idea.   It's not safe to ignore this issue since if we leave him to his own devices we may not hear much other than Van Halen and Iron Maiden.   Obviously feel free to bring as many of your own cd's as you want &amp; if you let us know what types of tunes you like we'll try and bring ours (if any) that match.   Don't worry too much about Ted's taste - I always insist that he bring along a Walkman &amp; headphones!Glad to hear the company is doing well, but just in case you need some ideas with some of your projects, I got this from a friend this morning:The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generationto the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse,the best strategy is to dismount.However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors tobe taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be triedwith dead horses, including the following:   1.

Il Mulino and Union Square Cafe were alwaysfavorites.   What do you think?Just something to keep in mind as you are evaluating your investments:The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generationto the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse,the best strategy is to dismount.However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors tobe taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be triedwith dead horses, including the following:   1.   Buying a stronger whip.   2.   Changing riders.   3.   Threatening the horse with termination.   4.   Appointing a committee to study the horse.   5.   Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.   6.   Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.   7.   Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse.   8.   Creating a training session to increase the riders load share.   9.   Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.   10.   Change the form so that it reads: \"This horse is not dead.\"   111.   Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.   12.   Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.   13.   Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting   its full original cost.   14.   Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.   15.   Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would   improve productivity.   16.   Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.   17.   Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs   better.   18.   Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.   19.   Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.   20.   Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.\n"

It's quickly becoming one of the world's largest tradedcommodities, yet it's one of the last to be bought and sold over theInternet. But that's about to change today when Houston Street Exchangeintroduces HoustonStreet.com, a new online electric power trading floor thatallows power traders to buy and sell electricity faster and better thanbefore.Houston Street Exchange hopes to do for the power industry what Erade did for the stock market: turn the industry upside down by bringingtogether buyers and sellers in a real-time, efficient online format. Thiswill shift the control of the $70 billion wholesale power market in theUnited States by putting it directly into the hands of power marketers,utilities and other traders that are entering the increasingly deregulatedenergy market. HoustonStreet.com serves as a portal for power traders,providing critical information regarding weather, energy news, stocks andother direct links necessary for trading electricity. HoustonStreet.com ispioneering the emerging business-to-business e-commerce power tradingmarket.Lights out for phones, static Web sitesHoustonStreet.com delivers what has so far been elusive to the power trader:an easy-to-use, fully Web-based trading floor that gives power traders allthe information and flexibility they need to post offers, make bids, counterand re-counter instantaneously, until they close the deal.Historically, power marketers have attempted to finalize deals whilejuggling numerous phones and praying no one is undercutting theirtransactions because they can't see a real-time picture of market pricing.They lose precious time because they must call around to get the latestmarket prices.   HoustonStreet.com eliminates that by giving power tradersinstant access to current pricing fluctuations in different regional powermarkets.\"The real-time environment of the Web naturally lends itself to tradingwholesale power,\" said Paul Messerschmidt, manager of Power Markets Servicesat Energy Security Analysis, Inc. \"But existing online products areinflexible and they typically require proprietary hardware or software tooperate.   Until these issues are rectified, wholesale power trading onlinewill remain dormant.

Concerning your comments on swap itsself, the ability of the Delaware Trust to perform under the swap is purely a function of Enron (in this case ETOL) performing its obligations under the subdebt agreement. Milbanks (acting for the investors and the draftsmen of the swap docs) have no doubt provided that whilst ECTRL need only pay $ when it receives o, ECTRL may not terminate the swap or cash out if the Delaware Trust does not perform because ETOL has not performed. This is probably the optionality to which you referred when we spoke.Robina is aware of this. She is awaiting pricing from Harry. Both you and Harry should feel free to contact Robina (on 171 316 7438) to discuss any terms of the swap which are not clear to you. (I am now on holiday until 2nd August).In case you don't already have it, I also attach the deal structure chart which may be of some assistance.Our timetable is to CLOSE on August 12th. We would like to have all docs in agreed form by the end of July.Thanks for your help.   Mark PS: Paul Coleman is from Slaughter and May and is representing Enron on the deal.\n"

London has undertaken this with respect to Europe (and, shortly, Singapore).   I have undertaken to coordinate this with respect to North America.   Thus, if you could send me a list of North American Enron entities to be incorporated in the E-commerce program (and the products they will trade) I can then undertake to determine what issues such presents.   In this regard, I will coordinate with ECT-Legal in North America to verify that the manner such entities are to be incorporated into the E-commerce program does not trigger unplanned for tax consequences.In addition, it would be helpful to obtain copies of the form of agreements to be entered into by counterparties prior to such parties being granted access to the E-commerce system (i.e., the form of on-line access agreements and any agreements ancilliary thereto).   These agreements are important to the tax analysis of the E-commerce program because the manner such agreements are to be entered into may implicate tax nexus concerns that we will want to work to mitigate (for example, if it is contemplated that all such on-line agreements are to be administratively executed by a single entity (\"Administrative Entity\") on behalf of each Enron trading entity participating in the E-commerce system, such process could expose the Enron trading entity to tax exposure in the jurisdiction in which the Administrative Entity is located - obviously, this may be more complicated if it is uncertain where such Administrative Entity is located).Finally, it is understood that the manner in which trading is to be effected through the E-commerce system is such that the Enron trading entity established as the entity to trade with a particular counterparty will be the only such Enron entity transacting business with such counterparty.   In this regard, therefore, it is not contemplated that one Enron trading entity will transact in part with a counterparty and that another Enron trading entity will complete such trade (for example, it will not be possible for a counterparty to obtain an agreement with respect to a particular product with EEL that will then be supplied by ECT - though this may occur on occasion in a fashion no different that is currently the case).   Please notify me in the event that this understanding is not correct so that we can plan to mitigate the potential tax issues that will be raised if trading is to occur otherwise (in this regard, as was discussed on Tuesday with Dave Mally and David Port, if a trade is transacted in a manner whereby one Enron entity executes a transaction and fulfills the requirements of such by purchasing inventory from another Enron entity, the income derived in such transaction is potentially subject to taxation in multiple tax jurisdictions).Please contact either myself at x30938 or, if I am unavailable, Jeff Blumenthal at x35777 in Houston with any follow-up questions.   Best regards.\n"

The page will list a reserve price and identify the number of credits to be auctioned.   We are willing to commit to transact up to that number with the best bidders (at or beyond the reserve   price) but may transact larger volumes if we choose.Users' offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period (this time frame remains a bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more) and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of winning bidders.Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full amount of their offer to buy.It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction period but we would like to have that option.I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor.   Harry is preparing the \"GTC\" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on our standard contracts for these products.   We need to put the legal framework together for the rest of it.   If the existing PA and ETA are adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind.   We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of paper.   It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those counterparties would make sense.   Can we talk on Monday?\n"

It is not entirely clear to me what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to Australian power products.   You probably already know that the EnronOnline people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access.   Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.   Unfortunately, that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.   It sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would be a total pain but certainly possible).   On the other hand, if you feel comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties   without that test being performed, we can do that, too.   Pleas let me know if we should ask Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be limited to Australian entities.\n"

There are a couple of general rules that apply to \"normal\" trading circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances vary (even just a little bit) from \"normal.\"   For example, abnormal situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we are trading (except as spelled out below).   Having said all that, the following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.   Of course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or can't be done by us from the U.S.).2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to the master agreement.   If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other rules may apply.   3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on behalf of ECT International.   Note that there are special considerations if the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is actually \"arranged\" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT International).   If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two countries for final negotiation and execution.   It would be a good idea to consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice.   These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal counterparty to the transactions.   This doesn't determine where within the Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.   If we want the risk to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) to get the risk in the right place.\n"

      "body": "\nThursday January 20, 4:51 pm Eastern TimeCompany Press ReleaseSOURCE: Enron Corp.Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; ProvidesBusiness Overview and Goals for 2000HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ --- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its annual equity analyst conference today inHouston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the conference by highlighting Enron's tremendousgrowth across all businesses and the outstanding 7000 percent return to shareholders over the past decade.   Enron presented key objectives for 2000:   Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.   Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.   Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a recurring theme throughout the day.Wholesale Energy BusinessGrowth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, Enron's largest business. Wholesale energygrowth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the United States andlarge-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron expects to continue to broaden its early leadacross the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesalepresence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity provider in March2000.EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are generated through this innovative, Internet-basedtransaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000 transactions have beencompleted since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record withover 7000 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline aresignificantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction methods.Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with expansions planned or underway on several of itssystems.Retail Energy ServicesWith over 16,5000 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place to service customers worldwide. As the strongcontracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services'goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and energyservices, nearly double the level in 1999.Enron Broadband ServicesThe new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, reflects its role in the very fast growing marketfor premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global broadband network controlled by softwareintelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network iswidely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to Internet service providers, thus providing the platformfor two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband content delivery.A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills from its energy businesses, bandwidthintermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also providepremium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and large broadband file transfer, with differentiatedlevels of quality in a usage-based business model.As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun Microsystems that provides for accelerateddevelopment of broadband Internet services.Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications companies. The company, which ownsapproximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs andoperates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customersaround the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address isww.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ```ENE.'''This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 19333 andSection 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes that its expectations are based on reasonableassumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. Important factors that could cause actual results to differmaterially from those in the forward looking statements herein include political developments in foreign countries, the ability topenetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband services markets, including the energy outsourcemarket, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity andthose relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of changes in interest rates, the timing and success ofEnron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, communications, internet- related and other infrastructureprojects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the periods covered by the forward lookingstatements.Contact: Gary Foster of Enron Corp., 713-853-4527.

This information includes Counterparty Name, various Address data such as documentation (confirmation), headquarters, and settlement (including wire bank, ABA, and routing), and various contact names and phone numbers such as trader, settlements, etc.For Global Credit Aggregation to be supported most efficiently, all Enron companies must utilize a common identifier for the counterparty on a trade, i.e., Southern Energy Marketing for Portland = Southern Energy Marketing for ECT = Southern Energy Marketing for EES = Southern Energy Marketing for EPMI.   Global Credit must 'see' exposure from each affiliate for a counterparty as the same party to aggregate to a corporate level.For Portland General, the list of trading partners are mostly parties we already have in the GCP database.   However, there will be some counterparties that are specific to Portland General (the same could also be true about EES).   For that reason, I would like to train specific individuals at each company to perform the GCP administration/maintenance for their counterparties much like we handle the ECT London and Calgary operations.   What we will have is a system shared as depicted below : There would be select individuals at each company to maintain their counterparty information via Terminal Server in a common database maintained here in Houston by ECT IT.   This type of access would give these individuals access to Counterparty data for all companies regardless of their own company affiliation. Each company/business unit will have an extract or view from the main database of only their counterparties to support their trading and downstream systems versus those systems being integrated directly with the main database containing all information.What I need to know is whether any of you see a problem with this 'sharing' of technology and data between ECT and PGE or EES and the intended implementation.   Based on Bill Dassenko's understanding of the FERC Code of Conduct, we think this proposal is within the guidelines.   Please provide any comments or your acceptance of this proposal by Monday, December 21st.   Thank you.---",

Reviewing it briefly, I only see a few that we don't already have in GCP. In discussing this with Bill (Dassenko), he sees no reason under the FERC code of conduct that we cannot see ( or share) public information   about shared counterparties such as would be populated in GCP. He is prohibited from sharing specific deal info or exposures, neither of which would be an issue in GCP. Hope this helps...I'll be back in on Tuesday and we can talk more if you need to.Debbie ---",

There are a few financial counterparties which I have not yet included on this list. All names on the list are wholesale counterparties with which PGE trades power or gas or are wholesale customers.   There are no retail customers on this list.In general, under the FERC \"Code of Conduct\" rules established for working with affiliated companies, the unregulated entity (ECT, EPMI) can tell all to the regulated entity, but the regulated entity (PGE) can share in only the most general of terms. Further,   PGE conversations can not convey any information which is otherwise not public about PGE's markets or customers.   Although the question is a good, I believe I have more to worry about when talking to you than what you do when talking to me.

Leading online platform signs agreements with HoustonStreet Exchangeand True Quote   EnronOnline, Enron Corp.'s giant online platform,,, has made the firstCommodity in what may become a consolidation of competing electronictrading exchanges in the energy industry.   Enron Net Works, the division which operates EnronOnline, last weeksigned cooperative agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange and True quoteLLC.   And industry sources confirm that EnronOnline is negotiating similardeals with several other exchanges, including Houston-based Altra EnergyTechnologies and RedMeteor, as well as e-Speed, an exchange backed byDynegy and, Williams.   HoustonStreet Exchange, headquartered in Portsmouth, N.H., wasrecently ranked among the top 20 dependent energy exchanges by AMRResearch, a Boston consulting firm which put Altra in first place.   True Quote, based in Louisville, Ky.,   a startup trading platformbeing developed by APB Energy --- an over-the-counter brokerage firm ---along with PG&amp;E National Energy Group, EnForm Technology and MicrosoftCorp.   EnronOnline is the world largest commodity trading platform, but usersan only trade with Enron. Rather than being a true trading exchange,industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of Enron'sbusiness.   But in EnronOnline's first six months of operation after beinglaunched last November, the value of transactions conducted on the,system surpassed $50 billion at a rate of $1.5 billion a day. Theplatform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities, from mostforms of energy to bandwidth and paper   MORE EYEBALLS   The agreements EnronOnline has struck will enable the company to postthe prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity onHousonStreet.com and TrueQuote.com Neither HoustonStreet nor TrueQuoteprices, however, will appear on EnronOnline. Customers on those twosites who click on an Enron quote will be instantly linked toEnronOnline, where the trades will take place.   \"As Louise (Kitchen, president of EnronOnline) said, extending theirpricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for Enron,\"says Paul Bourke, president of Altra. \"The question is whether it willbuild volume for the other exchanges.   \"We are talking to Enron,\" Bourke adds. \"We are intrigued, and we areattempting understand what the business benefits to Altra would be.\"   He says an Enron-Altra deal would be \"more complicated\" than thoseinvolving other exchanges because of Altra's significant liquidity innatural gas. Altra is the leader in online natural gas trading.   While none of the exchanges would reveal what, if any, financial termsare involved in the agreements---other than to say there is no sharing ofcommissions ---Bourke says he expects that if Altra and Enron finalize anagreement, Enron would take a small equity position in Altra. Hespeculates that this is what Enron did with HoustonStreet.   Brian Pieri, vice president of Red Meteor, says the value ofEnronOnline to the other exchanges is that \"they bring' tight-bidoffers, which is something the exchanges have to work hard on. And morepeople will make the bid offers even tighter.\"   This means buy and sell prices are close together, which helps marketliquidity.   Asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that Enron mightbring to the other exchanges wouldn't just further fragment the market,Pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixth-grade dance.   \"The boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on theother side, and nobody is dancing. Somebody has to start and theneverybody else joins in. Enron brings more validity to this very newsituation,\" Pied says.   \"All of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity, of which Enron isthe king,\" says Bill Swanton, an analyst with AMR Research.   Swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within thenext six to eight months, and the ultimate surviving exchanges will notbe owned by any single player.   \"You need an independent exchange. I can't imagine Enron will end uprunning it. The trading community won't be satisfied with that,\" hesays.   Swanton points out, however, that Enron \"will attract attention theydon't want if they force, some of these guys out of business.\"   But HoustonStreet's CEO, Frank Getman, takes a different view of whatthe Enron deals mean.   \"Web-based energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity,thanks to these EnronOnline data deals,\" he says. \"The game is now aboutfunctionality and value-added services.\"Folder Name: Rahil JafryRelevance Score on Scale of 1000: 97___To review or revise your folder, visit http:///www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 8000-369-74666.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.   We=\r=20\rwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\r =20\rPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\r=20\rand our position on California energy issues.\r What happened in California\r The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\rly=20\rand demand.   California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 19998.   This incr=\reased=20\rthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.   At the same time, regulatory=20\rrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.   So=\r=20\rdemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.   The resul=\rt,=20\rpredictably, is a shortage.   This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\rpercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\r In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\r=20\rfactors that led to the current crisis.   First, the state=01,s regulations=\r=20\rforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.   The spot market for=\r=20\rpower is extraordinarily volatile.   The way firms behave in a free market=\r=20\rwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\rng=20\rterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.   I=\rn=20\rCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.   This would be the=20\requivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\re=20\rmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.   Everything was fine=20\rwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\rt=20\rwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\r Second, retail markets were not deregulated.   Regulated retail rates remain=\red=20\rin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\rcompetition out.   This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\rle=20\rprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\rregulated retail rate.   They are now nearly bankrupt.\r In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\rion. =20\rRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\r=20\rgeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\r=20\rspot prices.\r At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\r=20\rthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\rhich,=20\rif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\r Enron=01,s Role\r Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\rix=20\rthe problem.   Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\rpoliticians and the media.   Here are the facts:\r ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\r=20\rstate of California.   Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\r=20\rsame market available to other California purchasers.   Because we are a=20\rmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.   We ar=\re=20\rinterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\rts=20\rfor our customers.\r? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\r=20\rthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.   We=\r=20\rprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\r You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\rpower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\r=20\rthe open market.   Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&amp;turnback=018=\r of our=20\rcustomers to the utilities.   Here are the facts:\r ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\rmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\rly=20\rfrom the utilities.   This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\rallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\r? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\rto=20\rreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\r? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\r=20\rwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\rreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\r Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\r=20\rcrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\rcontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\r=20\rpower markets.   Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\rers=20\rwith solutions customized to meet their needs.   There has never been more=\r=20\rdemand for our products and services.\r The Solution\r The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.   In summary=\r, the=20\rstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\ret=20\rand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\r Increasing Supply\r California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\r=20\rshort of Byzantine.   Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=\rs=20\rthan a year.   In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.   California simpl=\ry=20\rmust streamline this process.   Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\rgenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\r=20\rregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\rdisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.   California can=\r=20\rhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20\rfacilities.\r Reducing Demand\r Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =\r=20\rThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.   An open retail=\r=20\rmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=\rd=20\rat lower prices than today.   California should fully open its retail market=\r.\r Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market\r In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20\rvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=\r=20\rterm, fixed-price basis.   The state has instead left procurement in the han=\rds=20\rof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=\r. =20\rOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=\rir=20\rprice risk.\r Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions\r The utilities in California are not paying their bills.   This has led to=20\rgreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=\r=20\rarrive at lasting solutions.   California must permit its utilities to recov=\rer=20\rtheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=\r=20\rdistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=\r=20\rneeded.\r Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=\r,=20\rwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=\r=20\rworse.   Price caps have been proposed.   They don=01,t work; have never work=\red;=20\rand they will not work here.   Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=\r,=20\rwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.   Imagine how=20\rineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =\rit=20\ris better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=\rey=20\ror Silicon Valley.   Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20\rshortage worse.\r The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20\rCalifornia.   There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=\r=20\rthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20\rconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.   This will also result in=\r=20\rCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20\rgeneration --- which the private sector can do --- instead of education, road=\rs=20\rand other public goods --- which the private sector cannot do.\r As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=\rhe=20\rcrisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:   We at Enron=\r will=20\rcontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20\rsolutions to the state. \n"

Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please let me know.Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls before then).Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline?A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff.Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop?A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Agency was involved in developing.Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop?A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements which Enron developed.Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency?A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without authorisation from Enron.Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit?A We are not releasing that information at this time.Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged the competitive lead of EnronOnline?A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined.Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies?A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very capable IT consultancy companies.Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided?A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual contributors.Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other companies looking to build something like EnronOnline?A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com.Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information into a public forum.A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our contractor does not seem to have been upheld.Q111 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction?A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information.Q12   If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you also filing a lawsuit?A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate.\n"

Let me know if you disagree.While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do not believe that Statement 1333 is appropriately applied to any contract which requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment which may be payable to the defaulting party.   An event of default and resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract itself (e.g. damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults, etc.).   \n"

I have tried to make it a bit stronger by deleting references to our positions being merely \"arguable.\"   The language I deleted in the first part of 3.4 I thought was unnecessary and just point out doors that may remain open for the SFA.   The language added in 3.5 was an attempt to show how much EEFT does vs. EnronOnline.Is there a reason we are referring to Net Works rather than EnronOnline LLC?   It is also a Delaware limited liability company.   Are we afraid it may have a I also wonder if the discussion of EPOL's involvement in 2.2 and 4.2 is really needed since the ETA is entered into on EEFT's behalf.   If this has not yet been raised by the SFA, it doesn't seem necessary to flag it for them.

This is a global phenomenon and the 1999&lt; &lt;nominations reflect the universal appeal and acclaim that this most&lt; &lt;prestigious award has grown to enjoy.   So, without further ado, here are&lt; &lt;the runners-up for this year's award.&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;(15 July 1999, Alabama)   A 25-year-old man died of injuries sustained&lt; &lt;from a 3-story fall, precipitated by his attempt to spit farther than&lt; &lt;his buddy.   His plan was to hurl himself toward a metal guardrail while&lt; &lt;expectorating, in order to add momentum to his saliva.   In a tragic&lt; &lt;miscalculation, his momentum carried him right over the railing, which&lt; &lt;he caught hold of for a few moments before his grip slipped, sending him&lt; &lt;plummeting 24 feet to the cement below.   The Military specialist had a&lt; &lt;blood alcohol content of 0.14%, impairing his judgment and paving the&lt; &lt;way for his opportunity to win a Darwin Award.&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;(111 August 1999 Germany)   A 42-year-old man killed himself watching the&lt; &lt;eclipse while driving near Kaiserslautern, Germany.   A witness driving&lt; &lt;behind him stated that the man was weaving back and forth as he&lt; &lt;concentrated on the partially occluded sun, when he suddenly accelerated&lt; &lt;and hit the bridge pier.   He had apparently just donned his solar&lt; &lt;viewers, which are dark enough to totally obscure everything except the&lt; &lt;sun.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;(25 May 1999, Ukraine)   A fisherman in Kiev electrocuted himself while&lt; &lt;fishing in the river Tereblya.   The 43-year-old man connected cables to&lt; &lt;the main power supply of his home, and trailed the end into the river.&lt; &lt;The electric shock killed the fish, which floated belly-up to the top of&lt; &lt;the water.   The man waded in to collect his catch, neglecting to remove&lt; &lt;the live wire, and tragically suffered the same fate as the fish. In an&lt; &lt;ironic twist, the man was fishing for a mourning meal to   commemorate&lt; &lt;the first anniversary of his mother-in-law's death.&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;(16 August 1999, Germany)   A hunter from Bad Urach was shot dead by his&lt; own&lt; &lt;dog on Monday.   The 51-year-old man was found sprawled next to his car in&lt; &lt;the Black Forest.   A gun barrel was pointing out the window, and his&lt; &lt;bereaved dog was howling inside the car.   The animal is presumed to have&lt; &lt;pressed the trigger with its paw.   Police have ruled out foul play.&lt; &lt;(1999, Nicosia, Cypress)   Under similar circumstances, an Iranian hunter&lt; &lt;was shot to death near Tehran by a snake that coiled around his shotgun&lt; &lt;as he pinned the reptile to the ground.   Another hunter reported that&lt; &lt;the victim, named Ali, tried to catch the snake alive by pressing the&lt; &lt;butt of his shotgun behind its head.   The snake coiled around the butt&lt; &lt;and pulled the trigger, shooting Ali in the head.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;(August 1999, Australia)   Drinking oneself to death need not be a long&lt; &lt;lingering process.   Allan, a 333-year-old computer technician, showed his&lt; &lt;competitive spirit by dying of competitive spirits.   A Sydney,&lt; &lt;Australia hotel bar held a drinking competition, known as Feral Friday,&lt; &lt;with a 1000-minute time limit and a sliding point scale ranging from 1&lt; &lt;point for beer to 8 points for hard liquor. Allan stood and cheered his&lt; &lt;winning total of 236 (winners never quit!), which had also netted him&lt; &lt;the literally staggering blood alcohol level of 0.353, 7 times greater&lt; &lt;than Australia's legal driving limit of 0.05%. After several trips to&lt; &lt;the usual temple of overindulgence, the bathroom, Allan was helped back&lt; &lt;to his workplace to sleep it off, a condition that became permanent. A&lt; &lt;forensic pharmacologist estimated that after downing 34 beers, 4&lt; &lt;bourbons, and 17 shots of tequila within 1 hour and 40 minutes, his&lt; &lt;blood alcohol level would have been 0.41 to 0.43, but Allan had vomited&lt; &lt;several times after the drinking stopped.   The cost paid by Allan was&lt; &lt;much higher than that of the hotel, which was fined the equivalent of&lt; &lt;$13,1000 US dollars for not intervening.   It is not known whether Allan&lt; &lt;required any further embalming.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;(28 January 1999, London)   A flock of sheep charged a well-meaning&lt; &lt;British farmer's wife and pushed her over a cliff to her death.   Betty&lt; &lt;Stobbs, 67, was charged by dozens of sheep as she brought them a bale of&lt; &lt;hay&lt; &lt;on the back of a power bike.   The sheep rushed forward and rammed the&lt; &lt;vehicle, knocking Betty and her bike over the edge of a vacant 1000'&lt; quarry&lt; &lt;near Durham, in northeastern England.   \"I saw the sheep surround the&lt; bike.&lt; &lt;The next thing she was tumbling down the incline,\" neighbor Alan Renfry&lt; &lt;told&lt; &lt;reporters.&lt;&lt;&lt; First Runner UP!!!&lt; &lt;First Runner up Award goes to...&lt; &lt;(222 March 1999, Phnom Penh)   Decades of armed strife have littered&lt; &lt;Cambodia with unexploded munitions and ordnance.   Authorities warn&lt; &lt;citizens not to tamper with the devices.   Three friends recently spent&lt; &lt;an evening sharing drinks and exchanging insults at a local cafe in the&lt; &lt;southeastern province of Svay Rieng.   Their companionable arguing&lt; &lt;continued for hours, until one man pulled out a 25-year-old unexploded&lt; &lt;anti-tank mine found in his backyard.   He tossed it under the table, and&lt; &lt;the three men began playing Russian roulette, each tossing down a drink&lt; and&lt; &lt;then stamping on the mine. The other villagers fled in terror.&lt; &lt;Minutes later, the explosive detonated with a tremendous boom, killing&lt; &lt;the three men in the bar.   \"Their wives could not even find their flesh&lt; &lt;because the blast destroyed everything,\" the Rasmei Kampuchea newspaper&lt; &lt;reported.&lt; eeww&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And the 1999 Darwin Award winner is...&lt; doh&lt; &lt;(5 September 1999, Jerusalem)   The switch away from daylight savings&lt; &lt;time caused consternation among terrorist groups this year.   At&lt; &lt;precisely 5:30 Israel time on Sunday, two coordinated car bombs exploded&lt; &lt;in different cities, killing three terrorists who were transporting the&lt; &lt;bombs. It was initially believed that the devices had been detonated&lt; &lt;prematurely by klutzy amateurs.   A closer look revealed the truth behind&lt; &lt;the untimely explosions. Three days before, Israel had made a premature&lt; &lt;switch from Daylight Savings time to standard time in order to&lt; &lt;accommodate a week of Slihot, involving pre-sunrise prayers.&lt; &lt;Palestinians refused to \"live on Zionist time.\"   Two weeks of scheduling&lt; &lt;havoc ensued.   The bombs had been prepared in a Palestine-controlled&lt; &lt;area, and set on Daylight Savings time. The confused drivers had already&lt; &lt;switched to standard   time.   As a result, the cars were still en-route&lt; &lt;when the explosives detonated, delivering to the terrorists their&lt; &lt;well-deserved demise.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;Not Quite Darwin Winners...but they're trying their best&lt; &lt;National Idiots&lt; &lt;Ann Arbor Idiot&lt; &lt;The Ann Arbor News crime column reported that a man walked into a Burger&lt; &lt;King in Ypsilanti, Michigan at 8:50 AM, flashed a gun and demanded cash.&lt; &lt;The clerk turned him down because he said he couldn't open the cash&lt; &lt;register without a food order.   When the man ordered onion rings, the&lt; &lt;clerk said they weren't available for breakfast.   The man, frustrated,&lt; &lt;walked away.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;Kentucky Idiots&lt; &lt;Two men tried to pull the front off a cash machine by running a chain&lt; &lt;from the machine to the bumper of their pickup truck.   Instead of&lt; &lt;pulling the front panel off the machine, though, they pulled the bumper&lt; &lt;off their truck. Scared, they left the scene and drove home.   With the&lt; &lt;chain still attached to the machine.   With their bumper still attached&lt; &lt;to the chain. With their vehicle's license plate still attached to the&lt; &lt;bumper.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;Louisiana Idiot&lt; &lt;A man walked into a Circle-K, put a $20 bill on the counter and asked&lt; &lt;for change.   When the clerk opened the cash drawer, the man pulled a gun&lt; &lt;and asked for all the cash in the register, which the clerk promptly&lt; &lt;provided. The man took the cash from the clerk and fled, leaving the $20&lt; &lt;bill on the counter.   The total amount of cash he got from the drawer?&lt; &lt;Fifteen dollars. [If someone points a gun at you and gives you money, is&lt; &lt;a crime committed?]&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;Arkansas Idiot&lt; &lt;Seems this guy wanted some beer pretty badly.   He decided that he'd just&lt; &lt;throw a cinder block through a liquor store window, grab some booze, and&lt; &lt;run.   So he lifted the cinder block and heaved it over his head at the&lt; &lt;window.   The cinder block bounced back and hit the would-be thief on the&lt; &lt;head, knocking him unconscious.   Seems the liquor store window was made&lt; of&lt; &lt;Plexiglas.   The whole event was caught on videotape.&lt; &lt;New York Idiot&lt; &lt;As a female shopper exited a convenience store, a man grabbed her purse&lt; &lt;and ran.   The clerk called 9111 immediately and the woman was able to&lt; &lt;give them a detailed description of the snatcher.   Within minutes, the&lt; &lt;police had apprehended the snatcher.   They put him in the car and drove&lt; &lt;back to the store.   The thief was then taken out of the car and told to&lt; &lt;stand there for a positive ID.   To which he replied \"Yes,&lt; &lt;officer...that's her. That's the lady I stole the purse from.\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;Seattle Idiot&lt; &lt;When a man attempted to siphon gasoline from a motor home parked on a&lt; &lt;Seattle street, he got much more than he bargained for.   Police arrived&lt; &lt;at the scene to find an ill man curled up next to a motor home near&lt; &lt;spilled sewage.   A police spokesman said that the man admitted to trying&lt; &lt;to steal gasoline and plugged his hose into the motor home's sewage tank&lt; &lt;by mistake. The owner of the vehicle declined to press charges, saying&lt; &lt;that it was the best laugh he'd ever had.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; \n"

When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any faith or could agree on a pricing index.   Fortunately, the market is starting to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here shortly.

This report comes out every day at 111:000 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.   The tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.   1 in Norway1 in France1 in the U.S.5 in LondonAs you can see, it is more popular in London.   This relates to the exact same concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight market.The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 route -   70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Christi - described as caribs to USG.The flat rate (ws1000) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 20001 actual voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.   As u can see by the last posting (May 111th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ...If you did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,1000 USD; vice versa if you bought at ws 190.The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).   We have a trading department here that should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.   In addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the international owners have commercial representation in the States.Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 1555 to ws 315 over a months time - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market when broken down.   For example:Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a \"last done\" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 5000,000 bbl market.   Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.333 bbls p/mt hence 7.333 x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...   This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of buyers.   When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, North Sea, etc... they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.   (I apologize if this is remedial for any readers)   In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard.   Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x ws 160 level.On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, or the T9 route.   For the most part the breakdown is as follows :Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they deliver them cpp from the USG.   Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.   Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc...Columbia -   same players(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to them.   Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.   Some of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).   For example, Lyondell has a C.O...A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves p/mo.) for 2 years.   The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flows.   Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal with on physical vessel trading.   In addition, the freight people are not going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that trading Department Heads might have.In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 20001, A combined result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.America.   Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off   we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank.   Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.   FIynn presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.   The pricing would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.   This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals concluded overall.Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.

I am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.\n"

When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any faith or could agree on a pricing index.   Fortunately, the market is starting to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here shortly.

This report comes out every day at 111:000 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.   The tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.   1 in Norway1 in France1 in the U.S.5 in LondonAs you can see, it is more popular in London.   This relates to the exact same concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight market.The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 route -   70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Christi - described as caribs to USG.The flat rate (ws1000) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 20001 actual voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.   As u can see by the last posting (May 111th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ...If you did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,1000 USD; vice versa if you bought at ws 190.The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).   We have a trading department here that should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.   In addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the international owners have commercial representation in the States.Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 1555 to ws 315 over a months time - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market when broken down.   For example:Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a \"last done\" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 5000,000 bbl market.   Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.333 bbls p/mt hence 7.333 x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...   This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of buyers.   When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, North Sea, etc... they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.   (I apologize if this is remedial for any readers)   In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard.   Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x ws 160 level.On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, or the T9 route.   For the most part the breakdown is as follows :Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they deliver them cpp from the USG.   Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.   Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc...Columbia -   same players(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to them.   Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.   Some of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).   For example, Lyondell has a C.O...A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves p/mo.) for 2 years.   The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flows.   Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal with on physical vessel trading.   In addition, the freight people are not going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that trading Department Heads might have.In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 20001, A combined result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.America.   Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off   we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank.   Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.   FIynn presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.   The pricing would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.   This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals concluded overall.Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.   For it would be in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.   If this was to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets --- whereby futures rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, first half/2nd half, etc --- if it became so big that sellers weren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing tool, who knows what can be done.

At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to change MG's status.Per the advice from S&amp;C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK \"arranger\" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical solutions:1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco Inc.2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd (depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK and Switzerland.Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision.

      "body": "\nWestern Power Market Stands 'Poised on the Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser ConsultingGroup's 1999 Bulk Power OutlookFAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ --- Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are ```poised on theprecipice''' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next, according to a new study of the regionalmarket by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ```The West stands at least a one in three chance ofexperiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of 19998,''' said Judah Rose, a SeniorVice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications:   Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying   on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak capacity requirements. Because demand growth is   outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years.   Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive year of above-average hydroelectric generation   --- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus --- will again mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in   1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 19990s resurface, the West will find itself at an even greater risk of   price spikes.   Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 2000, the result of both higher regional spot   natural gas prices and the increasing value of ```pure capacity''' --- the value of ensuring reliability for consumers. The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and highlights the following key results:   Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand growth is strong, creating a long-term regional   capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 20005, unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region.   Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices is for negative real growth through 2010, but   the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is   slowly added over the next few years.   Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue to rise (but still remain below many other   regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.   Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by 2010,   with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas   supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if any, real price appreciation through 2010. ```The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the other five regional volumes, offerscomprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power markets,''' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of theICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ```No other firm can match our analytic capabilities --- which are based on an understanding of thefundamentals driving electric power markets --- and the knowledge gained from working one- on-one with the market's keyplayers.'''About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power OutlookICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, an authoritative assessment of North Americanregional bulk power markets through 2010.

My impression is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading financially.   If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents.   In each case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties.   Our only issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage.   As to the credit issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading under the existing terms.   As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them go ahead.   If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always stop trading.Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed.   The so-called \"omnibus\" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions - even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty.Tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our Lotus Notes database so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute basis.   She will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get the necessary software to access the database.

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in fetuses and newborns. Babies can't make enough docahexanoic --- or DHA --- a fatty acid that helps the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and mackerel. \n"

Fishkin's Proposal and my Comments of 2/19/999 Mark: Just a brief note to follow up with additional information regarding the Global Information Site mentioned by Mr. Fishkin, and my comments to that section.   As I mentioned in my memo, Sheri Cromwell has been gathering data and working with the Internet group to come up with the initial draft for the ECT Legal website.   Sheri completed the first draft last Friday and asked me who will need to be involved in the review and approval of this information.   I mentioned to Sheri that you and Tana were working on a special project and that one of the goals was to create a Global Information Site or something similar, and that I had mentioned to you as well that she was gathering some data for that particular purpose. I'm not sure what your plans are regarding the Intranet Site, but since Sheri has already done this work I thought I would let you know in case you and Tana are interested in talking to Sheri and reviewing her work.   Sheri has a lot of good ideas and she seems to enjoy project development responsibilities, not to mention that she's had the opportunity to establish good relationships with the Internet team.   Thanks.Nony\n"

Hilcorp has offeredForcenergy $6,086,000 in cash for the properties.Sierra Mineral Development L.C. indicated interestin purchasing the Texas and Louisiana properties in late19998. In March, one month after signing a letter of interestwith Sierra, Forcenergy filed for Chapter 111 relief. Hilcorpthen agreed to finance Sierra?s purchase of the Forcenergyproperties. Any purchase agreement will list only thenames of Forcenergy and Hilcorp.The terms of the agreement include Hilcorp?sresponsibility to \"assume all liabilities related to the Propertyafter the Effective Date, and all Plugging and AbandonmentObligations and Environmental Obligations, if any,regardless of when incurred,\" the filing reports.Forcenergy claims that this is a fortuitous time forthe approval of the sale due to the current stable cash flow,the production of its onshore properties, and the potentialfor sustained growth in its offshore Gulf of Mexico drillingfacilities.The oil and gas explorer and producer alsorequested the approval of overbid procedures, recognizingthat new interest in Forcenergy?s properties may comeafter other interested parties review the purchase agreement.Any person submitting an overbid to counsel forthe creditors? committee, Hilcorp, Forcenergy, and theBank Group is subject to offering a price of no less than$6,236,000 and the elimination of any break up expensereimbursement.Competing bidders for the assets must submit adeposit equal to 10% of its bid plus evidence that it is ableto consummate the transaction.After the last overbid, the court will allow Hilcorpthe opportunity to overbid by an additional $50,000. Anyfurther bidding will continue in $50,000 increments.If the court approves the purchase of the propertiesby a bidder other than Hilcorp, Forcenergy would pay upto the $1000,000 that Hilcorp estimates it will incur as itscosts and fees related to the sale. If a break-up expensereimbursement becomes necessary, Hilcorp will providedocumentation of expenses to the court.Forcenergy also asked the court to approve its listand calculation of amounts to be paid to cure all of its pre-petitiondefaults.\"If no amount is listed, the Debtor believes thatthere is no Pre-Petition Cure Amount due and owing to thatparty,\" the motion states.\"The Debtor requests that, unless a party files anobjection to the Pre-Petition Cure Amount so scheduledand serves a copy on Debtor?s counsel by the time to befixed by the Court at the Procedures Hearing, such partyshould be forever barred from objecting to the Pre-PetitionCure Amount,\" the filing further contends.The company?s revenues declined after a decreasein gas and oil prices in late 19998 and early 1999. Thedeclining revenues also negatively impacted the companyafter 19997 and 19998 acquisitions outlays.The court has not yet set a hearing date on thebidding procedures request.

The impasse to date had been SWD's unwillingness to agree on the content of the external (V&amp;E) legal opinion we were offering.   After considerable debate, SWD instead agreed to obtain their own form of external opinion (from Linklaters). In terms of the ECT legal opinion, the changes shown represent deviations from our standard form of opinion (as of August last year).   Would be grateful for your views at to whether these would be acceptable from Mark Haedicke's point of view, and also taking into account any changes that may have occurred in the meantime.   John Thompson (who heads up the Frankfurt office) would execute the Master, and I have already arranged for the appropriate corporate authorisation from Enron Europe Finance &amp; Trading Limited.One sticking point has been SWD's demand that the opinion given under paragraph 4 (\"No authorizations, consents, etc...\") should also apply to SWD; this would seem unacceptable to me.[Please note that we intend that Jim Derrick would give a legal opinion relating to the Guaranty.]Regards and thanksJustin\n"

      "body": "\nHere is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, insertions in bold).   Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any questions or comments:A:   The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option contracts.   SP:   What's a futures contract?A:   It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of   commodity through a regulated   exchange.SP:   How is the contract different than a non-futures contract?A:   Ahem,   just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts forward or over the counter contracts.   The big difference is that the forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not.SP:   I though the futures contracts went to delivery.   I remember getting all messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans dumped in their front yards?A:   Well, er,   yes they do sometimes   go to delivery, but they are not really supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery.   They are supposed to   more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial transactions.   It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract.SP:   Well lets get to the point,   why are physical buy sells so bad?A:   That's easy.   Because they look like futures contracts.   They are not intended to go to delivery.   And if you are trading in futures contracts you are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. SP:   So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC?A:   You've got it.   But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law against you to get out of performing.   So you can think of each contract like that as having written a free option.SP:   Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward contract?A:   What do you mean?SP:   Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 29 days, would we have a futures contract?A:   Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.   I'm telling you once and for all that physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the hell out of my office!---Is this the basic idea and if so,   how much can we blend physical into it to cross the line into the domain of the forward contract?   ---Christian Basically, yes.   A lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also the parties' intentions.   If we do not intend to make and take delivery, if we intend to settle financially - or even intend to just have the option to settle financially, we have a problem.   The closest thing we have to an exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to deliver.   That is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform.   We argue that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when there is a failure to make or take delivery.   Unfortunately, in the power world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out.   However, each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen - we do not enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out.   The book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the book-out.   In fact, if we didn't want to book them out, we could stand on our legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery (although I assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time).\n"

      "body": "\nI'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night.   I'll bring along some sailing info. but thought I'd let you know now what we've got in mind.   Dan &amp; Jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 6 of us.   We have gotten a quote for a relatively new 46' sailboat in the British Virgin Islands for the week of Thanksgiving.   We'd fly down there on Saturday the 20th, pick up the boat the next day and return either Saturday the 27th or Sunday the 28th.   [The return date is still under discussion - so far we have (i) Jamie who wants to fly Saturday so we have a day at home before going back to work, (ii) Mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as possible so wants to come back Sun., and (ii) Ted who when he heard the question said \"Let's start back Saturday and spend the night in South Beach!\"]   The charter company is the Moorings (their website is ww.moorings.com) and the specific boat we reserved is called a Moorings 463.   You can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom.Each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible - get up whenever (I seem to remember Jamie getting up pretty early &amp; making coffee), have breakfast on the boat, decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked out, maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way, maybe not.   Maybe stopping for lunch somewhere, maybe making sandwiches while we sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day.   Most days we only actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 2 or 3:000 and spend the afternoon swimming (Ted's favorite), snorkeling (the masks, etc. come with the boat), hiking on shore, exploring the coastline in the dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading, chatting, napping or whatever (my favorite).   There's a CD player and we listen to a variety of music - luckily Ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal proclivity for the duration of the trip.   If you scuba dive there are dive companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip - there is at least one really good wreck dive (in 70 - 90') in the BVI.   If you want to learn to dive, you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in NYC and do your certification dives in the BVI (Dan &amp; Jamie might be diving, Ted &amp; I probably won't).   Sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail hour for me.   There's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the boat with food (there's a fridge, stove &amp; bbq grill on the boat) and as you might guess Dan and Jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board if we don' feel like going ashore.   While no one is excluded from any activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary, we don't always do everything together, either.   Everybody usually pitches in and shares what work (cooking, cleaning up, sailing stuff) there is, although if only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and Ted probably wouldn't be expected to cook.   In the past Jamie has been the only smoker and he has invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck.As for $,   the boat, provisioning (food on board for breakfast lunch and a few dinners), taxes, airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night we get there all comes to about $760 per person.   Extras include drinks (only fair since you and Jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us) and any dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare.   I've tentatively got   flights for you (through the boat company) that come to $5444 per person, though if we decide to come back on Saturday that might go down.   Ted &amp; I usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're not always successful.   It's such a popular week to sail we need to decide pretty soon so we can put a deposit down - the boat is not actually reserved until we do.I'd better stop &amp; send this - it's turned out to be a good bit longer than I intended but I get carried away sometimes when I daydream about sailing!   Check out the website &amp; let me know if you have any questions.\n"

      "body": "\nFYI - I found this on the internet today:=ABB: Power Derivatives Trading In Germany Still Long Way Off [Dow Jones News Service via DowVision ? Rcvd: Mar 18, 05:51 AM ] By Axel Revheim OSLO (Dow Jones)---Derivatives trading in the German electricity market won't take off until certain structural blocks in thepower industry are cleared, paving the way for a spot market to develop as a first step, Jonas Kollberg, head of ABB FinancialEnergy told Dow Jones this week. ABB Financial Energy is a division of Swiss-Swedish engineering and construction conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.(ABBY). A small number of large, vertically integrated German electricity companies are effectively hindering the development of freetrade - presenting a stumbling block by both owning the production of electricity and controlling the means of transmission, orgrids. Currently, if a third-party wants to transport power, it must separately negotiate access and prices for each grid - an impracticalarrangement for the spot market, Kollberg said. 'The advantage of the Nordic model is that you have great liquidity for derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged systemprice. You also have several producers creating a well-functioning spot market. I can't see how they're going to solve this inGermany. They have too many isolated (monopolized) grid areas,' Kollberg said. Financial power contracts like futures, forwards and other derivatives are based on an underlying reference price, often anaverage of spot price throughout a region or country. There won't be any power derivatives trading in Germany before anacknowledged reference price is established, he said. A Liberalized Market In Law Only The practice among German utilities of pricing electricity transmission based on the distance traveled, is a powerful barrier totrading, Kollberg said. In the fully liberalized Norwegian power market, for example, independent producers are charged feesfor access to grids based on an established point system. Producers pay the same tariff, regardless of how far the electricity istransported. Germany's new energy law, in effect since April 19998, paves the way for all German consumers to choose who supplies themwith electricity. However, without clear, published grid access tariffs or a national reference price, few customers have, inreality, been able to move away from their regional supplier. No decision has been made yet as to how Germany will organize its spot market for electricity sales. The first German electricitybourse is likely to be set up in either Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg or Leipzig. But interested parties such as the DeutscheBoerse in Frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be in place before futures trading can beintroduced. Nord Pool, the joint Swedish-Norwegian power exchange, recently joined up with Germany's Landesbank SachsenGirozentrale, the Leipzig town authority and the Saxony state government to establish a power exchange in Leipzig. Using expertise gained in the Nordic market, Kjetil Knutsen at Nord Pool Consulting told Dow Jones that the plan is to developa spot market in Germany along the lines of the Nordic model. There will be one system price for the whole of Germany, based on spot prices in the seven regions which are controlled byGermany's 'Verbund' regional transmission companies, he said. 'One can solve the spot price problem,' he said. The question isn't whether Germany will have a functioning spot market, butrather when, he said. Separation Of Producers, Grids The Key Even if Germany eventually establishes a reference price, the problem of vertical integration remains. One needs unbundling(between producers and grids) to open the way for competition, ABB's Kollberg said. According to ABB's own analysis, between 78% and 83% of German power transmission lines are owned and controlled bythe big German power producers. As long as domestic producers have such grid control, power imports and exports from Germany won't be free, said Kollberg. Any overcapacity of French power generation could be imported to the benefit of German consumers. however, becauseGerman producers control transmission, the tendency is to shield the domestic market from competition, observers said. French electricity imports could lower prices sharply for German end-users of electricity. According to Kollberg, there's anovercapacity of 40 terawatts of electricity in France, while Germany too has an overcapacity of 31 TW. \n"

I am pleased to hear that he is making a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer so that I can feel the benefit of it.I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some help.Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking piling up).At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.We will look forward   to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.Bye for now,DebPS Dad is using e-mail these days and has got his own e-mail account.

Chuck Grassley introduced legislation last night tooverhaul the nation's bankruptcy system.The bill he introduced - S.2220 - is identical to the final conference reportapproved last year by the Senate and House of Representatives butpocket-vetoed by President Clinton.Grassley said that he looks forward to Senate action on the measure whichhad veto-proof support last year. Senators voted 70-28 for the finalpackage, and the House gave the conference report unanimous approval inDecember. Rep. George Gekas is expected to reintroduce the legislation inthe House.The Senate Majority Leader has indicated that the bankruptcy reform billcould be ready for consideration by the Senate as early as next week.Grassley said the proposal which he sponsored last year with Sen. RobertTorricelli of New Jersey \"is unfinished business that has strong bipartisansupport in Congress and at the grassroots.\"The reform measure is aimed at reducing the number of bankruptcies filedeach year by fixing weaknesses in the code and designing a more balanced,fair approach for debtors and creditors. The number of bankruptcies havesoared during the last decade despite a historically strong economy. And,according to a study released late last year, experts are predicting a 15percent increase in bankruptcies in 20001.The legislation advanced by Grassley and Gekas also includes permanentstatus and an expansion of Chapter 12, which is tailored to help farmersreorganize debt and stay in the business of farming. It also includes apatients' bill of rights for residents of nursing homes and hospitals thatdeclare bankruptcy. Another key provision helps to strengthen the MedicareTrust Fund by prohibiting the discharge of debts arising from inflated billsand fraudulent claims.The legislation reintroduced today reflects the bipartisan, bicameralagreement reached late last year on the most comprehensive reform ofbankruptcy law since 1978.Grassley said \"reforming the system will be good for consumers and families.It would bring more fairness for those who work hard to pay their bills.Every bankruptcy filed puts upward pressure on interest rates, so decreasingthe number is good for people trying to buy a new house or pay for a car.Reforming the bankruptcy system will help usher in a new era of greaterpersonal responsibility.\" The Iowa senator began his effort to reform thebankruptcy system in 19997, when he held a hearing on the relationshipbetween credit card debt and consumer bankruptcy.The bill that resulted addresses the problems caused by irresponsibleconsumerism, an aggressive credit industry, lax bankruptcy laws andlawyer-run bankruptcy mills. It sets up a flexible formula for bankruptcyjudges to channel those with repayment capacity to Chapter 13. Currently,the overwhelming majority of debtors file under Chapter 7, which effectivelywipes away their debts. Only about one-third of debtors opt to file underChapter 13, which requires some repayment plan to reimburse creditors.The measure also seeks to improve the bankruptcy system for consumers bypromoting credit counseling services and educational courses for debtorsprior to filing a bankruptcy petition. The plan strengthens enforcement andpenalties against coercive tactics by creditors. It penalizes creditors whoseek a double-payment and establishes tough penalties for creditors who usethreats to coerce debtors into voluntarily agreeing to pay a debt whichcould be wiped away in bankruptcy.The legislation will minimize court dockets and keep costs down. It promotesthe alternative dispute resolution process by saying that if someone infinancial trouble tries in good faith to work out a reasonable repaymentplan, but a creditor rejects this, then the ability of the creditor tocollect in bankruptcy will be sharply curtailed.The bill also would make Chapter 12 for farmers a permanent part of thebankruptcy code. The package strengthens this tool for farmers by making anincreased number of farmers eligible for Chapter 12 protections and makingthe federal government last on the list of creditors when a farmer sellsfarm assets during reorganization. Changing the treatment of capital gainstaxes under Chapter 12 would give farmers greater flexibility inreorganizing their financial affairs.Finally, the reform proposal includes:- a provision to protect quality of care for patients - especially nursinghome residents - when a health care provider is in bankruptcy. Current lawdoes not guarantee the well-being of patients in a bankruptcy case. Twoyears ago, residents of a California nursing home were literally evictedonto the street by a bankruptcy trustee.- a provision setting new requirements for credit card companies and protectconsumers. These provisions reflect some of the most significantpro-consumer legislation considered by the Senate in a decade. Under themeasure, creditors are required to display prominently a minimum paymentwarning on every credit card statement. This feature would include atoll-free number for credit card holders to learn how many months it wouldtake to repay a certain balance with minimum monthly payments. It alsorequires credit card solicitations to disclose when a low introductory rateends and what the subsequent rate will be. And, it requires credit cardsolicitations via the Internet to comply with the Truth in Lending Act.- unprecedented new protections for child support claimants. The reform billallows claimants to access otherwise off-limits property and has the supportof key child support advocates.- limits on the ability of individuals to protect assets by purchasing anexpensive home. Right now, there are no limits on the value of a homesteadthat is off-limits to creditors. Although the General Accounting Officefound only scant evidence of systemic abuse of the homestead exemption, thebankruptcy reform bill includes changes long-advocated by Sen. Herb Kohl ofWisconsin and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to put a $1000,000 cap on homeequity acquired within two years prior to declaring bankruptcy. TheKohl-Sessions proposal requires that an individual establish residency fortwo years prior to bankruptcy in order to claim the homestead exemption of aparticular state. The bill also allows creditors to seize any home equityacquired with the intent to delay or hinder collection efforts within sevenyears prior to declaring bankruptcy. And it says the home equity built upapplies to the $1000,000 cap even if an individual relocates from one stateto another.Since 19990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 1000percent. Since 1980, the number of Americans declaring bankruptcy hasexploded from 3331,264 to just under 1.4 million last year. Filings began toincrease dramatically after 1985, despite the strong economy.-30-Home| Constituent Services| Grassley News |Legislative Information|Kids' Stuff| Biography / In Action\n"

      "body": "\nWho knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre.___Subject: Darwinian Kharma, Very weird   (A true story from AssociatedPress,by Kurt Westervelt)Stick with this...it's worth it!   This is the strangest thing I've everheard.   The series of events that had to have taken place in order forthisto happen are astounding!   At the 19994 annual awards dinner given forForensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded hisaudiencewith the legal complications of a bizarre death:   On March 23, 19994, themedical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that hediedfrom a shotgun wound to the head.   Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of aten-story building intending to commit suicide.   He left a note to thateffect indicating his despondency.   As he fell past the ninth floor hislifewas interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killedhiminstantly.   Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safetynethad been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect somebuilding workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able tocompletehis suicide the way he planned.   \"Ordinarily,\" Dr. Mills continued, \"Aperson who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even thoughthe mechanism might not be what he intended\" is still defined ascommittingsuicide.   That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have beenanunsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused themedicalexaminer to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.   The room on theninthfloor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man andhis wife.   They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her withashotgun.   The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that hecompletelymissed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opusashe passed by outside.   When someone, intending to kill person \"A,\" killsperson \"B\" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.   When confrontedwitha murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they bothsaidthey thought the shotgun was unloaded.   The old man said it was hislong-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.   Hehadno intention to murder her.   Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appearedtobe an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.   Thecontinuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's sonloading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.   Ittranspired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support andtheson, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgunthreateningly,loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot hismother.The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.   Nowcomes the final twist!   Further investigation revealed that the couple'ssonwas in fact, Ronald Opus.   He had become increasingly despondent over hisfailed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.   This led him to jump offthe ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgunblastpassing through the ninth floor window.   The son had actually murderedhimself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it asuicide.\n"

      "body": "\nJanuary 7, 2000   Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85   A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | ENTERTAINMENT   Filed at 3:21 p.m. EST   By The Associated Press   LONDON (AP) --- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th   century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of legions of   readers, has died. He was 85.   O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book   for several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not given   and there were conflicting reports of the date.   The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but newspapers   and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday. O'Brian   had lived in France since 1949.   O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy   during the Napoleonic wars.   A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him to   evoke a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic jets and   smart bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of   sea battles fought under sail.   The series, begun in 1969 with ```Master and Commander,''' is the story   of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack   Aubrey, and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and secret   agent who doesn't much like sailing.   Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic   readership from the start, it wasn't until the 19990s that they achieved   wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ```historical fiction'''   genre in which they generally were reviewed.   In 19991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ```the best novelist you   have never heard of.'''   ```Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which happens   to be set largely at sea,''' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 19997, praising   ```the intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the plotting,   and the brilliance of the writing.'''   O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, specialist   language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't   remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the frantic activity   on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement as a   man-of-war turns to engage the enemy.   A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, but   O'Brian didn't think definitions important.   ```Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,''' he once said.   ```Explanation almost certainly would be.'''   O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John Bayley, a   former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's   ```originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of (history) to   invent a new style of fiction.'''   ```No other writer,''' Bayley wrote, ```not even Melville, has described the   whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet lyrical   accuracy.'''   O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted questions   about his personal life.   He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, and   it wasn't until 19998 that he was revealed to be the son of an English   doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily   Telegraph said in an obituary Friday.   The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but   changed his name in 1945. During his school years, he was frequently ill,   spending much time reading. His writing career began at age 15, when he   published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow leopard.   During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly   with Britain's Political Intelligence Department.   In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern   France. His first seafaring novel was ```The Golden Ocean''' in 1956,   about a Pacific expedition.   O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in Britain   by the beginning of the 19990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the   American publisher W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight home.   The rest, as they say, is publishing history.   Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 20th   book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily   Telegraph reported.   O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph   Banks. A linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone de   Beauvoir and Colette.   O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 19995.   Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard,   from his first marriage. \n"

I know how depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night.   Even though the hotel where I lived for the first three months I was in Jakarta was very nice, it was still just a hotel room.   I was so glad to get out of there into an apartment - major quality of life improvement.We've been just busy enough for me this month: Austin for a couple of days on Presidents' Day weekend, a Rockets game last Friday, and we're off to the Diverse Works annual gala on Saturday.   Ted wants to leave town to do something - anything - next weekend but I'm trying to talk him out of it since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following Saturday.   Since my arguments carry no weight, I'm just lucky that air fares are surprisingly high right now - $1000 rt to Ft. Lauderdale is even too high for Ted.Ted's brother is working on a   project here in town so we had him over the other night for dinner.   Ted had planned - can you guess - tuna steaks, having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish.   How do you just forget something like that?   Luckily they went to the gym ahead of time and Ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and bought his brother a steak on the way home.That nice January bump in Enron's stock price is ancient history now - pretty much the whole thing has been given back.   I'm still going to buy a new car - looks like an Audi A6 - but just one.Hope you are doing well!Mark\n"

      "body": "\nHi Dave:Thanks for your note!   It's hard to believe that Washington House was over twenty years ago now.   I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law school in Michigan.   My first job after graduating was for a law firm in Houston.   They opened a New York office in the mid 80's and I went there to help out.   The office wasn't successful but I loved living in New York so I moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total.   One of those years was spent working in Asia - primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong.   I've now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron - a large energy company - and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues.   We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit periodically.   I'm actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I'm helping them get some products ready to trade online.   I get back to Washington a couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually have been there when you were in town - I think I was there the 111th &amp; 12th.I've stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M.C. from time to time.   Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of international mutual funds for American Century.   I was on the Alumni Board for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see the people who came back - unfortunately I haven't really stayed in touch very well.   There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while - of course Woodbine is gone, there's a new theater, a big addition to the gym and several major interior renovations.   And I understand there are big plans for more - they are going to close Sixth Street, tear down Gibson and expand the campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm, a big expansion to the sports facilities (indoor track, pool, etc.) and a redesign of the library.   Enrollment is up above 1000.Congratulations on your successful career - who would have thought when we got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well!   There are doctors, bankers, chemists and lawyers everywhere you look.   I guess we really did learn something while we were there.Let me know if you ever get to Texas.   It would be fun to get together and catch up.Mark Taylor13222 Rutland St.Houston, TX 7770008(713)863-7190(home)(713)853-7459(work)\n"

As you know, Enron is a 50 percent owner of the Dabhol project, which should be operational next month.We want each of you to know that this report is entirely without basis.   We are very disappointed that Human Rights Watch has chosen to listen to the perspectives of the people who have opposed the project since the beginning. As you are probably aware, project opponents filed more than 20 lawsuits against the project in the Indian courts over the past four years.   Every lawsuit was dismissed, withdrawn or ruled in DPC's favor.   The project is clearly above reproach.Enron was advised of the Human Rights report just a few days before it was issued.   The Dabhol Power Company, the Government of Maharashtra and our many supporters were never even contacted.DPC has worked hard to promote positive relations within the community.   A handful of people who oppose the project were interviewed for this report in great detail.   Unfortunately, the good relationships we have built with a large percentage of the community were not reflected.   Our community efforts have included building a school and a hospital, planting thousands of trees at the site, building wells for drinking water and conducting numerous job training programs for area residents. Last year, Enron made a $5000,000 grant to CARE to be used for programs in the state of Maharashtra.Our media statement on the issue is as follows:Dabhol Power Company does not tolerate human rights abuses by its employees or contractors.   And, while we respect the work of Human Rights Watch and its mission, this report is out of context at best and dredges up allegations that have been put to rest over the past four years.   Much of the report deals with concerns over state police actions, over which we have no control, and it is misleading by Human Rights Watch to allege so.Please refer any media inquiries to the Enron International public relations office at 713-646-6416.\n"

I remember hearing that there were times that the construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the protesters.

On this one point:It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.   IBJ is the most sophisticated Japanese player in the derivative market and one would believe that they could handle the documentation for both financial and non-financial entities.   I note, I have heard that it is not market practice for Japanese financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions, so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position. I understand.   My view is just that it is probably not a systems issue but a position and it irks me to have the point made as a systems issue when it is not.   As we both agree, the   issue may be moot depending on what Credit thinks.\n"

Attached you will find an e-mail that I sent to Alan regarding ISDA documentation, for which I need approval from Houston.   Alan has informed me that he left you a voicemail on this subject and I was hoping you could provide me with guidance as to whom I should contact to obtain approval.By separate e-mail, I will be forwarding weather derivative GTC's for use on EOL with Enron Japan Corp. as the Enron counterparty.   Please also advise who I should be in contact with to obtain the requisite approval for these GTC's, as well.Best regards,John---",

Guarantee.The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted.   It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other counterpartiessuch as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.   I note that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa.Please note:1.   There are still a number of \"options\" in the documents which I have not completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.   These are indicated in squarebrackets.   Please let me know how you would like to deal with these;2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in the documents;3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that appropriate counsel reviews same;and4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common inJapan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties.Please let me know if you have any questions.Best regards,John\n"

(this is funny!)If Airlines Sold Paint...BUYING PAINT FROM A HARDWARE STORECustomer: Hi. How much is your paint?Clerk: We have regular quality for $12 a gallon and premium for $18. How many gallons would you like?Customer: Five gallons of regular quality, please.Clerk: Great. That will be $60 plus tax.BUYING PAINT FROM AN AIRLINECustomer: Hi, how much is your paint?Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends.Customer: Depends on what?Clerk: Actually, a lot of things.Customer: How about giving me an average price?Clerk: Wow, that's too hard a question. The lowest price is $9 a gallon, and we have 150 different prices up to $2000 a gallon.Customer: What's the difference in the paint?Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.Customer: Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint.Clerk: Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do you intend to use it?Customer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off.Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $2000 paint.Customer: What? When would I have to paint in order to get the $9 version?Clerk: That would be in three weeks, but you will also have to agree to start painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least Sunday.Customer: You've got to be kidding!Clerk: Sir, we don't kid around here. Of course, I'll have to check to see if we have any of that paint available before I can sell it to you.Customer: What do you mean check to see if you can sell it to me? You have shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there.Clerk: Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have it. It may be the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on any given weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12.Customer: You mean the price went up while we were talking!Clerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of times a day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing to happen again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. How many gallons do you want?Customer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe I should buy six gallons just to make sure I have enough.Clerk: Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the paint and then don't use it, you will be liable for penalties and possible confiscation of the paint you already have.Customer: What?Clerk: That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your kitchen, bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the bedroom, you will be in violationof our tariffs.Customer: But what does it matter to you whether I use all the paint? I already paid you for it!Clerk: Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the way it is. We make plans based upon the idea that you will use all the paint, and when you don't, it just causesus all sorts of problems.Customer: This is crazy! I suppose something terrible will happen if I don't keep painting until after Saturday night!Clerk: Yes, sir, it will.Customer: Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy my paint.Clerk: That won't do you any good, sir. We all have the same rules. Thanks for painting with our airline.\n"

The theory there is that as the market moves against us, we are cushioned by our \"out-of-the-moneyness\" and will be able to ask for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in the money.   I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.   We need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the credit work sheets --- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the paralegals can suggest something?).   I suggest we add the following language (taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far we go out of the money: \"Credit Support Amount\" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as provided in the definition of that   term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent Amounts.I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of alternatives for Paragraph 13.\n"

I agreed that you and I would rework a couple of examples for her, and then she can apply the same principles to the remaining descriptions.I think the best way to proceed on this is if we work up example wording for most of the different publication types, and/or verify any wording suggested by Jennifer against the original confirm language.I will bring up the originals to you, but my suggestion for a rework is:Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL):The Index for a day shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the following calendar day under the heading \"Daily Price Survey\" in the Oklahoma - PEPL section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a business day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding business day.Monthly price example (For NGI, Northern California Border):The Index for a month shall be the \"Bidweek Average\" price for the Northern Cal Border Average as listed in the table entitled \"California Border &amp; Non-Utility End-User Citygate tables\", published in the first issue in such month of Natural Gas Intelligence Weekly Gas Price Index.Monthly price example (For Inside Ferc, Texas,Oklahoma PEPL)The Index for a month shall be the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co - Texas, Oklahoma (mainline) price as listed in the section entitled \"Prices of Spot Gas Delivered to Pipelines\", published in the first issue in such month of Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report.In each of the above examples, PCG will need to substitute the price name and section name for each of the applicable prices in each purblication.Dave\n"

As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will alsoneed to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are anyoverriding local laws which could impact on the use.   The overseas lawyershave copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line andthe ETA will be posted on the Website.   Each person authorised by acounterparty with a password must \"click through\" the Agreement beforecommencing trading.   This will only be done on one occasion.We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, thata counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it wasnot aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA areenforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitationsof liability etc.   Having said that, the view might be taken that byentering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterpartyreceives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in aposition where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.   Once thecounterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is madeand the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time thatthe counterparty has clicked through the ETA.   I suspect that this is theapproach that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell had in mind.   It is also worth bearing inmind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering intothe ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have hadinternal legal sign off.   This may delay trading.Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAAoff line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents aremarked up with that structure in mind.   As agreed yesterday, I have onlymade changes to the document produced by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell where I thinkit is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.   I have thefollowing brief comments on the changes I have made:1. Parties:   You will see that both documents are entered into by adesignated Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron groupundertakings.   The reason for this is that Transactions will actually be made between thecounterparty and various different Enron entities.   We therefore need to ensure thatsuch Transactions with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of thesedocuments. I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we needto list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the Transactions.   I think there maybe some confusion here. This is not the case.   I assume that the current Enron entitieswhich trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so onthe Website. The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve thisbut I assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages onthe Website depending on what password has been inserted.   The documents now contemplatethis.2. \"Services\":   I have removed the references to Services as I am notsure what this means. I would have thought that these agreements need to govern thecounterparty's access and utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry outany Transactions.   Therefore, I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred toServices, it can now refer to \"access and utilization of\" the Website.3. Contract Formation:   I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3of the ETA which provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enrongenerates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that anyelectronic records of Enron will prevail.   I note that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell envisage adocument being attached which explains this.   This is also acceptable.4. Data Protection:   On reflection, it will be more appropriate forrelevant data protection wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. livingindividuals, rather than corporate entities such as the Counterparty.   Before providingappropriate wording for this, could you please let me know what information will becollected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.   Forexample, when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this orcan you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or otherinformation on them once they have entered the Site.   You will need to check this with yourtechnical people.Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have yourcomments.I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleaguesfor their review.

Perhaps you could apprise Louise of the situation, and find out for definite (if possible!) what will in practice occur with the trading system (viz. viewing the long descriptions).If we need to cross refer to the GTC in the short description, my thought is that option 4. below would be the simplest solution based on what we've done to date.

I agree that it is very important to ensure that theproduct descriptions, both long and short, are incorporated into thecontract and that this incorporation is very clear. The ETA states that ifthere is no master agreement in existence between the parties the GTCs onthe website will apply. It must be clear from the website which terms theseare.As we discussed on the telephone, there are a number of ways in which we candeal with this:1. the GTCs could state that the long and short form descriptions applywhen trading on the particular GTCs - it would be necessary to list theproducts in the GTCs to which those GTCs apply. However, I am not sure how acounterparty makes the connection between the short form description and theGTC (possibly by accepting the GTCs when entering the website on the firstoccasion).   In any event, if you add a new product later which will betraded on those particular GTCs it will be necessary for the counterparty toaccept those GTCs again;2. a new column to be inserted on the trading screen which shows whichGTCs apply - I assume this is unacceptable from an aesthetics point of view;3. a reference to the GTCs to apply and the long descriptions to beincorporated in the short form descriptions - I assume that when acounterparty clicks on a price to bid, this reference would appear in thebid box with the short form description ;4. a reference in the short form descriptions to the GTCs being asstated in the long form descriptions and that both are incorporated - thisis on the assumption that by clicking on a price to bid, this referencewould appear in the bid box with the short form description.It is very difficult to advise properly as to which of these methods is themost appropriate without seeing the design of the website. The essence ofincorporation is whether it is clear to the user that the terms have beenincorporated. That said, I assume that 2 and 3 will be unacceptable. Withthis in mind,   you may prefer option 4. However, I would want to see thedesign of the layout of the website before confirming this advice.Please let me know if you have any queries concerning this.Kind regards.Andrew&lt; ---Original Message---&lt; From: Edmund Cooper [SMTP:ecooper@ect.enron.com]&lt; Sent: Tuesday, July 13, 1999 12:56 PM&lt; To: Andrew.Wilkinson@cliffordchance.com;&lt; Timothy.Hughes@cliffordchance.com&lt; Cc: ssefton@enron.co.uk&lt; Subject: GTCs&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Andrew and Tim,&lt;&lt; Please note Scott's point below.&lt;&lt; Thanks, Edmund.&lt;&lt; ---",

She was asking them why she could not trade with her id and password that she had been given.I called her and explained that she could not use a Guest Id to trade and told her that she needed to send in a UK PA (explained to her the location of the form on the web site).   She said she would send one to us.Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub user.   She then told me that she transacted a deal in London for EN590.   I told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood this ?Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ?   Please advise as to how we are to deal with this.ThanksArfan\n"

      "body": "\nDear John:So sorry for the delay.   I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.   I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent:Part 1 (b)   In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$1000,000,000.   To accomplish this in the schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the dollar figure adjusted accordingly.Part 1 (d)   Has Baker &amp; McKenzie recommended this?   We rely on local counsel advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.   The risk in the automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not able to protect since we are not aware of it.   In the U.S. the bankruptcy code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.Part 1 (e)   We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the non-defaulting party the most flexibility.   Market Quotation is often suggested because of its apparent objective nature.   However, in many of the markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).Part 1 (h)(ix)   This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires the posting of collateral to cover any open position.   If the party fails, it then becomes a default allowing termination.Part 1 (h)(x)   Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could happen?Part 2   Have our internal Tax people approved this?Part 3   I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of the corporate documents referred to.   Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does not think it necessary.   In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made in the corporate documents, etc.Part 5 (b) (g)&amp;(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind (although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).   If neither party is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.   On the other hand, since we are choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law applies as well.   If that is our theory, there are additional representations (the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back in.Part 5 (d)   We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.   While I think we will get there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.   So far I guess we leave it the way it is.Part 5 (j)   My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.   Any differences in Japan from US practice we should be worried about?Paragraph 13   I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 provisions as the Schedule.   My only concern here is with the MAC clause and it looks like there's a glitch in the form.   It seems to me that if the counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.   The way it is drafted now if either S&amp;P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.   The counterparty doesn't have to worry about Moody's at all.   Just a thought.On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.   My only comment is that we would usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra $5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is exceeded.Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the changes between the US form and the Japan form.   I may have a few more comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.I hope this is helpful.   Please feel free to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be useful.   We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these going forward.   It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.   It may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on other things.We're looking forward to having you back.   \n"

But before I comment on that, our stock price is still up even   if it went down that much today. It's up 40% since the beginning of the year   when the Dow was down. As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up   about 75%. That's one reason why it's so volatile. Some people bought in   along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the   uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off the   table. As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a growth   stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility, just like all   the other companies that fit into that category. Throughout the market,   technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but often   $10-$12-$15 a whack. What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility on the   upside, but I hate it on the down side.   We've had a change in the ownership of our stock. Increasingly, it's being   bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being sold by   the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower   valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and put it   back into lower P/E stocks. I know this makes everybody a little nervous, but   this is probably the world we're in now. I'd rather be in this world with a 50 P/E   than the more stable world with a 20 P/E.\n"

        " Paul Goddard/LON/ECT on 12/05/999 19:57 ---Paul Goddard12/05/999 18:58To: christopher.millard@cliffordchance.com, andrew.wilkinson@cliffordchance.comcc: Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Legal Issus with Hypertext LinksAs Louise mentioned briefly in today's meeting, we need to obtain a view on the legal implications of   \"linking\" web pages and the news and information they contain.   Some specific issues we will need a perspective on include:1) Legal issues associated with providing hypertext links to: -   3rd party websites (avoiding unauthorized links such as in the Shetland Times case in the UK). These sites may include other   interesting energy sites -   links to news items (external URL sites), etc... Is mutual consent enough? What are the liability issues? 2) The flipside: Potentially allowing linking of our Enron Online site onto websites of third parties, (e.g. in the form of click of simple hyperlinks or through   \"banner ads\" which would take users from the external site,   such as an FT.com, and bring them to our site as a marketing tool).   *3) Issue of Publishing/Re-distributing/Re-purposing news or other business information from other sources   (e.g. E-Trade shows Reuters news - what sort of legal agreement are they likely to have in place on a global basis?)   (e.g. Coral Energy - have an up-to-the-minute energy news presence with all stories footnoted as \"copyright 1999 by FWN\" - presumably another external news agency). Most of the above relates to our plans for a \"News Viewer\" and \"Links Page\" which would encompass both :i) publishing Enron commodity-related news to external (and internal) users.ii) displaying/re-distributing commodity news provided by an external agency (e.g. Reuters, etc.) to external and internal users.How do we satisfy the copyright requirements of others (i), and ensure we get full copyright protection for our own news (ii) given that all of the above will likely be viewable globally   ?4)   As discussed today, providing multiple hypertext links to GTCs .   Although it would be far more preferable to automatically personalize the site such that only legal information relevant to that customer is seen, as a fall back option, would there be any issues showing the multiple links (i.e. would users know which GTCs applied to them if bombarded with various options).\n"

I was told recently that Carol St Clair was going to help support the West Trading desk on physical transactions.   Since she came from the financial legal group I was wondering if she would be able to help with financial transactions as well.   I feel there are synergies to having the same Enron lawyer represent us for both the EEI and ISDA.   A recent example of this could be the SMUD relationship.   Carol recently completed an amendment to the existing ISDA and now is looking at sending them a EEI.   The SMUD credit and legal personnel are the same so the process should be quite smooth.   I was interested in your thoughts on this.   You can reach me by phone (503-464-3810) or email.   Thanks.Stewart \n"

If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just \"under a swap agreement?\" \n"

His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.\"Welcome to Heaven,\" said St. Peter. \"Before you get settled in, though, it seems we have a problem. You see,   we've never once had a lawyer   make it this far and we're not really sure what to do with you.\"\"\"No problem-just let me in,\" said the lawyer \"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever one you want to spend an eternity in.\"   \"Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer   to stay in Heaven,\" said the lawyer   \"Sorry, we have rules,\" said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in an elevator   and it went   down-down-down to Hell.The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked about   old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good looking.   He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.   In fact, the lawyer was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave. Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming   and waved goodbye as he got on the elevator. The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he found St. Peter waiting for him. \"Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven,\" he said. So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his   24 hours were up. St. Peter came and got him. \"So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you   must choose your eternity,\" he said.   The lawyer   paused for a second, and then replied, \"Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell.\"   So St. Peter escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.   When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and putting it in sacks.The Devil appeared before the lawyer.   She now had horns sticking out of her head, fire spit out her ears and nose   and she had a very evil laughThe lawyer stammered:   \"I don't understand.   Yesterday, I was here and   there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable.\" The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled. \"Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours.\"&lt;&lt; (Life in the Law Firm)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

My inclination was that the index should be the same language that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous contract.   Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal text could wait for the paper confirm.Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal language.Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make sense to give you my version as well.What are your thoughts?   If you'd like to discuss, I will be in by 9:000 tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the lawyers and Mark to discuss the further long description review at 111.

I gather the information will be very stale by the time eol v2 is up and running and that this will serve primarily as a place holder in our web page.From our perspective, we'd much prefer to have indenpendent \"neutral\" sources (such as Platts, ICIS, CMAI ...) do the analysis, or at least do a feed.   The reason is (a) we'll never be construed as neutral and (b) we're so thin that the traders themselves are the only ones who can put this together.Thanks,Alan\n"

The agenda is \"information\".   Jose Manuel (Board liaison) and Diane Genova (Chair) of theLatin American Committee are enthusiastically involved and Pedro is ourstaff liaison.   We have great support from the Bank of Mexico, NAFINSA,Mexder (the exchange) and the Mexican Banking Association (all of which willcontribute speakers).   We would very much welcome one or more Enron speakers- particularly from the region.   (We contemplate simultaneousSpanish/English and English/Spanish translation to accommodate and encourageboth English and Spanish speakers).   Bob, Diane, Jose Manuel will also bespeakers.

Best regards, Ruth&lt; MANAGING NATURE WITH MARKET MEANS&lt; Latin Finance - February 16, 20001&lt; By Maria O'Brien&lt;&lt; Unpredictable weather and deregulation of Latin America's electricity&lt; industry have serious implications for power companies in the region. They&lt; must simultaneously manage the risks associated with nature as well as&lt; those inherent in a free market.&lt;&lt; In Argentina, Brazil and Chile, where power comes mainly from&lt; hydroelectric dams, the industry is vulnerable to fluctuations in&lt; rainfall. Meanwhile, privatization and deregulation of the electricity&lt; market in these countries will require generators and distributors to&lt; manage shortfalls and excesses in power more efficiently, a function&lt; financial markets are already fulfilling in the US and Europe. The use of&lt; financial hedges to mitigate risk is a trend companies and regulators in&lt; Latin America want to encourage.&lt;&lt; Mitigating weather risk is not an abstract problem for the Latin markets.&lt; In 19998, power generation in Chile nearly ground to a halt when droughts&lt; caused power cuts at hydroelectric generators. One of the most affected,&lt; Chile's Pullinque 49 megawatt hydroelectric dam, was forced to halt&lt; production when river water levels dropped drastically Scudder Kemper&lt; Investments and Energia Global International, who were investors in the&lt; project, rescued&lt; the plant in a $52 million deal.&lt;&lt; John Northrop, of Scudder's Latin American power group, says the company&lt; did not consider hedging against weather risk prior to the drought in&lt; 19998, since financial cover was written into the generator's 30-year power&lt; purchase agreement with Endesa, Chile's main power company and largest&lt; hydroelectric investor. Under a unique agreement between Endesa and the&lt; generator, Endesa had to buy power from Pullinque, but the plant was not&lt; required to supply power to Endesa. Unlike other hydroelectric plants in&lt; the region, Pullinque wasn't forced to purchase expensive natural gas&lt; power in the spot market to keep the plant running at a loss.&lt;&lt; During the drought, Endesa was unable to buy adequate hydroelectric output&lt; and had to rely on older, inefficient fossil fuel power plants to&lt; supplement hydroelectric production. Since then, Chile has begun importing&lt; natural gas power through the $325 million GasAndes pipeline from Mendoza&lt; in Argentina.&lt;&lt; Power companies in Brazil currently rely on assured power arrangements in&lt; which generators cover one another for shortfalls in energy. ma&lt; deregulated market, they will be able to buy and sell power as needed.&lt;&lt; The rising number of natural gas-fired merchant power projects, which sell&lt; all their power to the spot market when demand is high, shows how&lt; profitable this business can be. According to Capital DATA's global&lt; project finance database, financing for $4.5 billion worth of merchant&lt; power projects in Latin America is complete to date, with $10.2 billion in&lt; the pipeline. Argentina already has five operating merchant power plants&lt; supplying power to the spot market. Brazil is preparing itself for&lt; deregulation in 20003 with the launch of a thermoelectric power generation&lt; program that will build 49 new plants by 20003.&lt;&lt; US energy companies such as AES, Enron and Duke Energy are lining up to&lt; snap up distribution and generation companies in government&lt; privatizations. In Brazil alone, auctions of Cesp, the S?o Paulo&lt; generator, and Eletrobras, the federally owned generator, are expected&lt; this year.&lt;&lt; Following the lead of US energy companies, providers of risk management&lt; products are looking to get involved. One innovative risk management&lt; financing structure-for a power plant in Cartegena, Colombia-has been&lt; completed in the region and insurers, re-insurers and even investment&lt; banks are incorporating risk management into debt products in case another&lt; drought stifles hydroelectric power and injects price volatility into the&lt; spot market.&lt;&lt; Setting a Standard&lt; The Termocandelaria 314 megawatt 'peaking' gas-fired merchant power plant&lt; in Cartegena sells thermal power to Colombia's spot market. Colombia&lt; derives 70% of its power from hydroelectricity as a merchant power plant&lt; selling all its power to the spot market, Termocandelaria is 1000% exposed&lt; to revenue risks.&lt;&lt; The sponsor, KMR Power Corp., originally planned to raise financing in&lt; 19998 with a high-yield debt issue in New York's 1444A bond markets. When&lt; the bond market shut its doors to emerging market borrowers following the&lt; Russian crisis, the company was forced to look for an alternative&lt; financing scheme. KMR Power secured an agreement with Centre Solutions, a&lt; risk management unit of Zurich Financial Services, to guarantee an $85&lt; million subordinated loan structured to absorb power price volatility&lt; risks.&lt;&lt; Stefan Marti, vice president at the Centre Group in New York, says the&lt; insurance company determined KMR's debt repayments based on a seven-year&lt; projected rainfall profile. Termocandelaria scheduled repayments for&lt; periods when there was little rainfall and therefore increased demand for&lt; natural gas power in the spot market. Double A- rated Centre Solutions&lt; guaranteed to meet payments if revenues dipped. Marti says there were&lt; periods when Centre would make payments and recover them later.&lt;&lt; Once KMR Power secured this insurance, Bank of America agreed to syndicate&lt; a $90 million, five-year senior loan. Centre also took a $35 million chunk&lt; of the senior debt and five local banks joined the syndicate.&lt;&lt; Centre's participation was a landmark because until 19998, insurance was&lt; designed to cover catastrophic events and not to manage fluctuations in&lt; weather patterns. That year, MG Risk Finance, a division of the insurance&lt; company American International Group, developed its snow, temperature and&lt; rain management product to protect revenues that were adversely affected&lt; by unfavorable weather. MG provided insurance for an excess or shortfall&lt; in precipitation, extreme temperatures or any other weather event as&lt; measured by an independent weather source.&lt;&lt; Since the inception in the US of the weather risk management industry in&lt; 19997, and the creation of tradable financial instruments, approximately&lt; 5,000 weather derivative trades worth more than&lt; $5 billion have been completed.&lt;&lt; Enron was the first energy company in the US to develop weather risk&lt; management products. With $1.5 billion invested in hydroelectric projects&lt; in Latin America, the Houston-based energy conglomerate is convinced the&lt; potential for weather derivatives exists in that market.&lt;&lt; 'The appeal of a weather derivative\" says Valter Stoiani, a marketing&lt; executive in Enron's global risk management group, \"is that unlike&lt; insurance-which is designed to compensate for catastrophe and requires the&lt; buyer to submit a claim and demonstrate an actual loss- a derivative does&lt; not require proof of loss. Instead, settlement is based only on the&lt; performance of the index against a strike level with no up-front cost.\"&lt; Stoiani says that unlike insurance, transactions can be structured in many&lt; different ways. In one of the more popular forms, there is no up-front&lt; premium but the buyer is still able to exchange its variable exposure for&lt; a fixed exposure. The buyer receives financial compensation in the event&lt; of adverse conditions, but pays out in favorable weather.&lt;&lt; \"The concept of a flexible and inexpensive derivative is appealing but&lt; difficult to implement in Latin America at the moment,\" says Stoiani,&lt; because the market lacks fundamental elements.&lt; Mark Tawney director of Enron's worldwide trading operations, agrees,&lt; adding that \"the biggest problem for hedging weather risk in Latin America&lt; is the difficulty in assembling enough quality data.\"&lt;&lt; Unlike the National Weather Center in the US, there is typically no&lt; central pool of historic data in electronic form in Latin American&lt; countries. The quality of the data differs from country to country and in&lt; some countries there is little information available.&lt;&lt; Marti says Centre Solutions required 20 to 30 years of weather data to&lt; structure Termocandelaria's subordinated loan and \"unlike other countries&lt; in Latin America Colombia's data is quite good.\" Stoiani says that without&lt; 30 to 50 years worth of meteorological information, \"there is no&lt; foundation for a weather index as a benchmark for structuring weather&lt; derivatives.\"&lt;&lt; Jeff Kabel, director of trading and origination for Enron Argentina, says&lt; the company is working hard to educate local energy companies on the&lt; potential of weather derivatives \"as a tool to manage cash flow exposure.\"&lt; But the lack of liquidity in the power trading markets is also a problem.&lt; Even in Argentina, with an active wholesale market since 19998, there is&lt; still relatively low liquidity.&lt;&lt; In Chile, the state energy commission still regulates prices for retail&lt; clients. In Brazil, Mitsumori Sodeyama, president of the country's power&lt; exchange administrator, ASMAE, does not expect liquidity to pick up until&lt; the market is fully liberalized in 20006, since the wholesale electricity&lt; market was just introduced in late 2000.&lt;&lt; The Brazilian electricity regulatory agency, known as Aneel, is&lt; encouraging investment in hydroelectricity and has invited bids for 31&lt; hydroelectric generation plants totaling $12.2 billion. John Foster,&lt; senior vice president of Latin America for InterGen, an international&lt; power company jointly owned by Bechtel Enterprises and Shell Generating,&lt; doesn't think this is part of any long-term plan to exploit Brazil's&lt; hydroelectric potential. He says, \"There has been massive under-investment&lt; in Brazil in the last 10 years and with demand still growing, they are&lt; trying to build anything they can, period.\"&lt;&lt; However, Aneel is offering incentives to private investors in&lt; hydroelectricity and awarding concessions for the independent production&lt; of electricity to be freely traded in the wholesale market. Small&lt; hydroelectric plants with up to 30 megawatts of capacity are entitled to&lt; discounts of over 50% in fees for using transmission and distribution&lt; systems and can trade electricity at no cost with consumers of loads of&lt; 5000 kilowatts or more.&lt;&lt; Sodeyama \"absolutely expects a secondary market as the energy market&lt; evolves to a more mature situation.\" He estimates that Brazil's energy&lt; profile will reduce hydroelectricity to 80% of total energy investment&lt; from 92% in the next 10 years and increase its investment in natural gas&lt; from to 17.5%. from 5.5%. As private investors need to manage their hydro&lt; and thermal assets, \"this means potential for risk management products,\"&lt; Sodeyami says.&lt;&lt; Enron's Stoiani agrees that \"a couple of years down the road the market&lt; will pick up, \"and as competition increases, he sees \"growing interest&lt; from counterparties looking for effective ways to hedge their exposure to&lt; weather, as well as additional interest from speculators.\" With the growth&lt; in liquidity, Stoiani foresees opportunities for arbitrage and&lt; cross-commodity trading. He says \"a hydroelectric plant with no natural&lt; gas-fired back-up plant could purchase a derivative paying out gas units&lt; in times of low precipitation.\"&lt;&lt; The Centre Group's Marti says his company is writing weather-related&lt; insurance risk for both hydro and thermal power in South America for local&lt; and foreign power companies. \"It provides an interesting profile for&lt; smaller sponsors of power projects, who may have equity capital&lt; constraints,\" he says.&lt;&lt; Foster agrees and says that as the deregulated electricity markets mature&lt; and more efficient, less-expensive products emerge, investors will need&lt; some long-term hedge, either a portfolio of diversified assets or these&lt; financial products.&lt;&lt; In the long term, Enron's Tawney predicts that the growing needs of the&lt; energy sector in Latin America coupled with the deregulation of the power&lt; market will mean \"the energy industry will be both the first and the&lt; largest\" buyer of weather derivatives.&lt;&lt;&lt; THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF,&lt; ISDA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA.

SHCP isthe government entity that is affected for crude price fluctuations, and hashedged the crude exports from time to time, but they have not implemented a riskmanagement program yet. The volume of Mexico crude exports is close to 6000 MMBbl / year, and they can hedge up to that volume.Yesterday we have a meeting with Carlos Garcia Moreno and Rodrigo Ocejo. It ispossible that they already are hedging part of the volume, but they did not saidso. They were impressed with Enron's capability of taking the volume(transaction up to 50 MM Bbl) and were interested in Enron's market view for2000. They are interested in quotes for calls, puts and swaps for Cal 2000, 1stand 2nd half of 2000 and Cal 20001.We do not know yet, what is the financial agent that they use to do thistransactions, buy we believe that it can be Nafin or Banco de Mexico.We think it is necessary start working on the ISDA and a ConfidentialityAgreement with SHCP asap, in order to be ready when the time comes to close thetransaction.We are going to continue meeting these people and start quoting them the periodsand instruments they are interested in. Also, we are sending them today a EnronAnnual Report.Regards,Agustin Perez\n"

Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at the ASE.Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.   Since arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own devices for Sunday night.   We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday night after we wrap up for the day.   We will arrange transportation from the ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.   Currently, Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.   Therefore, we are planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back to the hotel. \n"

I don't think he'd mind if you called to ask.   That department is a little dressier than my area (they actually wear ties most of the time Mon - Thurs) but I think Friday is pretty casual there - and you have a pretty good excuse.   It might depend on who else (if anyone) you'll be seeing.   The reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior guys (don't know which one, but can find out if you want) on that floor is always in a suit &amp; tie.   If you're also talking to him it might make sense to bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview.\n"

What I'm not sure of is whether their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.   Are you aware of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?   I'm just wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner Newsome tomorrow.   It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the calendar, though.   Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall background noise of a big ISDA meeting.   Maybe I can come up alone and we can do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo time in the Commissioner's face.   What do you think?\n"

The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture. The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management for OTC trading, and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated clearing position. eNYMEX will provide a single, internet-based interface to both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system, depending on the session. The Exchange's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members to participate in OTC markets. The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, with some spot cash market products also offered. Over time, this would be expanded into such areas as precious and base metals, coal, and, potentially, bandwidth, weather, and emissions. Although the initial geographic focus will be on North America, contracts are also expected to be offered for some European and Asian locations. In addition to today's launch announcement, the key milestones of eNYMEX, are expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading, followed by Internet-based order-routing for futures trading, including a common interface for OTC and futures trading, and clearing and settlement of OTC trading. Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said, \"The global energy and metals community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that provides an open, independent, and neutral marketplace for trading by all participants, price transparency, counter-party credit risk management, and the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts.\" Mr. Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other available OTC systems: ? Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange. ? The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e-commerce with \"bricks &amp; mortar\". ? The Exchange's established and well-regarded clearinghouse, which will be used to provide counter-party risk management ? Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets, providing significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and commodities. eNYMEX will be a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n"

      "subject": "O'Brian article",
      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nI found this on a sailing magazine web page:An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick O'Brian to my attention, claiming him to be the finest living author writing in the English language. Being an avid reader who had consumed about everything including, of course, all of Forster's Hornblower books, I had my doubts. But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation and awe, I wholeheartedly concurred. After a second reading of the entire series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful, life-enriching experience he had given me. Since O'Brian obviously loved the sea, it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight's cruse aboard my Perini ketch, the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea, for himself and his friends without any interfering presence from myself. I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O'Brian would be offended by receiving such a letter and her interesting reply was, \"I get about 20,000 letters per year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do anything for me - he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent him from accepting.\" So I wrote via his publisher, having literally no idea where in the world he lived, and after some forwarding delay I received his handwritten reply, in his fine and precise penmanship, saying \"I accept your kind offer with perhaps obscene haste.\"As Mr. O'Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 19995 that included San Francisco, I invited him to dinner the week of his visit and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall. His host was the poet laureate of America (Robert Haas). I was both charmed and alarmed when introduced to O'Brian's lightening quick wit and rather acerbic manner. The following evening he and his wife, Mary, came to my house in Belvedere for a 'literary' dinner with admirers and one or two other authors. Mr. O'Brian was utterly charming, if perhaps a little aloof. He took tremendous interest in an Admiralty Board (dockyard) model I have of an English First Rater of 1702. He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented my own knowledge. After the other guests departed, we settled into a series of brandies by the fire and I discovered: 1) his capacity for serious drinking greatly exceeded my own; 2) his reserve only eased very slightly in the presence of this unknown American (me) and; 3) his knowledge of the practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil.After a half liter of cognac had vanished (and we were still calling each other Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Perkins), I produced a chart of the Mediterranean and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise. I had learned that the O'Brians' home was in Collioure, a village on the Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border, in Basque country. The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby, where Andromeda could pick all of them up. O'Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily, a stop in Greece, dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour of the Balearic islands. I was stunned! How, I wondered, could this old salt possibly comprehend a tour of over 3,000 nautical miles with numerous port calls, in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots? As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a desire to drop the hook in Naples, Capri and Tangiers as well. While I could not reconcile this plan with reality, I assumed it was the wine in control and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening's end that he had a major non-negotiable condition to accepting my offer; namely that I personally would join him, Mary and their guests aboard my yacht. ?In May 19995, as the departure date appoached, I had a rough time getting Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up. Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions, I have been pasted and this was one of the worst. Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all telecommunication as well, but after a real dusting we made it and O'Brian and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and charming home. He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes, pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar. I was fascinated by his office, where the books were written. It was lined floor to ceiling with reference works on an array of subjects (botany, geography, zoology, medicine, etc.) in several languages, but not a single volume dated later than 1820. He was literally immersed in the period of his work. The following morning we were joined by his close friend, the scholar (and foremost authority on Peeps) Richard Ollard, his publisher Stuart Proffit and his agent Vivien Green. We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit all the Balearic islands and O'Brian, somewhat wistfully, asked if an additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible? Told it was not, he boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver, short-changing him on his yachting holiday.Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind, the sailing was marvelous and O'Brian was delighted. I introduced him to the helm, but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth were fanciful. He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a day. However, he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of seasickness. Mary, quiet, kind, interesting and interested, was wonderful to have aboard. However, she was very frail. They were both nearly 80 and I constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship's motion, but thankfully this never occurred. Before dinner O'Brian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with relish. All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the center of the talk and controlled its direction totally. I found the level of sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had ever experienced, and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I was left far behind. My MIT engineer's degree had, alas, not prepared me for cultivated discourse at such a level. It was literally exhausting, but a marvel to follow. The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca. O'Brian suggested that we sail (sail, not motor) into the long narrow channel leading to the port of Mahon, the location of the first meeting between Aubrey and Maturin. This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromeda's size, but I carried it off, happily, without mishap. We had an interesting afternoon ashore with O'Brian showing us about the old city with intense enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan, the local tongue. That evening, while at dinner back aboard the yacht, he suggested for the first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me.And so our cruise continued, with Patrick showing keen interest in everything; we fished with some success; we sailed every day; we visited the port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands of sea birds. Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character Stephen Maturin, who is clearly modeled on Patrick's physique and personality.?One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal. It started with Patrick asking me if I had heard of a place, Indiana, and a school, the University of Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible? The University's English department had purchased (and not yet paid for) two or three of Patrick's manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on O'Brian which Patrick found intensely offensive. Patrick then mentioned that he was destroying all of his diaries, his journals and all of his correspondence so that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels. Richard Ollard was aghast, and Ms. Green was very upset with this quite startling revelation. Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picasso's letters when he had written a well-received biography of the artist. Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him, but that he, Patrick, could not rely upon the goodwill of \"some post-doctoral American fool.\" So the tension-filled discussion continued. The analogy of an artist framing his painting was raised; it was then complete and should not require either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist's frame of mind at the time of creation. Now, after Patrick's death, we understand some of his thinking. He was his own construct, born Patrick Russ, English not Irish, not university educated, not a sailor, a father who abandoned his family, and altogether a piece of his own fiction. But, that night aboard Andromeda, only Mary knew the truth and understood his deep motives.The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine Mediterranean weather. While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in light wind, with our centerboard keel raised and guided by - as it turned out - an inaccurate Spanish chart, we decided to sail between the coast and a small island, and we ran firmly aground in shallow water. In the Med one can't simply wait for a higher tide, so we emptied all our fresh water tanks and tried to back off. No luck. I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk with compressed air, over ten tons. Still no luck. Finally, we tied a long hawser to a rock astern and, using our anchor windlass to bar-tight tension, we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster. Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations. He nearly believed, I thought, that we had arranged the event for his entertainment. One morning at breakfast, after our friendship had become more firmly established, Patrick said, \"Tom, I wish to ask you an embarrassing question which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern world. What is software?\" My answer, \"The piano is the hardware and the sheet music is the software,\" satisfied him and upon reflection, myself as well.Every afternoon between two and five, Patrick retired to my on-board office to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral, then in progress. He borrowed the yacht's charts of France, particularly the area around Brest, to incorporate detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book. Very much to Mary's surprise he showed me each day's progress. She said that he had never shared his work with anyone before completion. Later, Patrick sent me the original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I treasure.Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business required that all of Patrick's guests and I depart. He and Mary continued on to Ibiza with the yacht's crew for three further days, mostly to study that island's renowned bird colonies. Then they sailed, uneventfully, back to Port Vendres.My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year. We corresponded. He and Mary stayed in my home. They were aboard my schooner Mariette. We met at his club, Brooks, in London. He was a genius and his books remain a towering, towering achievement. I miss him greatly.- tom perkinsbelvedere This story was reprinted from the August 2000 issue of Latitude 38.

Rcvd: May 111, 08:08 AM EDT ] BW0167 MAY 111,1999 5:09 PACIFIC 8:09 EASTERN ( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line Trading of BandwidthDerivatives Business Editors/Technology Writers SAN DIEGO---(BUSINESS WIRE)---May 111, 1999---Arbinet Communications, Inc., the world's leading trading network fortelecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and options in telecommunications bandwidth later thismonth. Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's access-controlled website where buyers and sellerscan post prices anonymously. Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening process for credit, documentation andinteroperability issues. The announcement was made at the TRA Conference, Booth No. 10004. As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled derivative product that will allow anonymousweb-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs. Implementation of this product is an extension ofArbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global Clearing Network(TM) (AGCN(TM))). Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposureto future moves in the price of capacity. Furthermore, it provides a level playing field where even small operators can realize thepricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large incumbent telecommunications carriers. Buyers and sellerscan manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future. Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as submarine cable operators. Buyers can be naturalconsumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange Carriers) or speculators. \"Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the bandwidth market,\" said U. Kanad Chakrabarti,vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet. \"As a non-proprietary player, we can offer impartial execution for our clients,which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this.\" All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site, ww.ebandwidth.net, beginning May 21, 1999.The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission capacity. The option contract allows buyers and sellersto realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but currently not fully priced by telecommunications players. \"We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading company,\" said Alex Mashinsky, chairman andfounder, Arbinet. \"Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which gives us complete objectivity in trade execution. \"This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom minutes on behalf of international and multinationaltelecommunications carriers.\" For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-12000 or via e-mail at kchakrabarti@arbinet.com. Arbinet (ww.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange and switch-based clearing network for globaltelecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for international carriers in 19998, which it estimatesrepresented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year. The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presentlyclearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies including Internet Telephony Service Providers andmajor carriers. Founded in 19994, the company has 52 employees and is headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo,Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong.

On the understanding that serveris to be located outside Japan, we have only the following comments:Time of ExecutionSection 3. &amp;copy; of the ELECTRONIC TRADING AGREEMENT provides that \"Transactionshall be deemed executed at the time that Enron first signifies its acceptanceof Counterparty's offer, accessible on the Website server.\"We understand that this means a contract will be formed when Enron \"dispatches\"its acceptance to its Website server so that the acceptance can be seen by theCounterparty's computer display (if he has not yet disconnected).   In otherwords, the contract will be formed at that time even though the Counterpartydoes not see Enron's acceptance (due to disconnection, communication error, orsome other reason).   If this is indeed the intention, the language could perhapsbe clarified in this regard.   (Since the agreement is governed by New York law,we have no objection to the current language if this is clear under New YorkLaw.   Perhaps the UCC covers the point?)Governing Law/JurisdictionWe see no problem with the governing law and jurisdiction provisions as theyare.TaxationWould you please confirm the role if any to be performed by Enron Japan inrelation to this business, so that we can ensure that Enron Japan will not beseen as a dependent agent (and therefore permanent establishment) of Enron NorthAmerica Corp.Best regards---This is an e-mail from Baker &amp; McKenzie - Tokyo Aoyama Law Office (QualifiedJoint Enterprise Offices).

It strikes me that while we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, the credit considerations are more problematic.   I would guess that the back office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the trades.   This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some respects.   When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the appropriate headroom.   I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would   that be acceptable to everyone?   Another possibility is for the fund to set up a master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to back deals with whichever entities need the allocations.   That would let them do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other entities.   Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for credit on its own somehow.   Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would be difficult (upstream guarantee problems).   \tFrom:   Bob Shults   02/03/2000 02:04 PM To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Louise Kitchen, Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT Subject: We have been talking to some of the hedge funds concerning EOL.   They want the ability to allocate transactions between legal entities.   They do not want to have different ID's and make seperate transaction for each entity (during which time the price could move) in order to self allocate.   Do you have any ideas on how we can facilitate this?\n"

      "body": "\nDigital Frontiers   Calif. Says Digitally Signed Broker Contracts Are Valid By ROSS SNEL   08/03/1999   American Banker   Page 12   Copyright &amp;copy; 1999 American Banker, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   A new California law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most, if not all, of their business in cyberspace. The legislation, which applies only to broker-dealers, validates brokerage contracts that are digitally signed. Though Internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line, most require customers to enroll and order account transfers by sending in paper documents. The law makes such paperwork no longer necessary. Digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds customer identities to documents-are seen as a way to \"legalize\" on-line exchanges of information. The California legislation, which California Governor Gray Davis signed into law last week, \"gives people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable,\" said Thomas J. Smedinghoff, a partner in the Chicago law firm McBride Baker &amp; Coles and a leading authority on digital signatures. He added, however, that the law's specific definition of a digital signature could limit the flexibility of its application as the technology evolves. Certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important to securities brokers, because securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise transactions on the Internet, said Christopher Musto, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors Inc. in Concord, Mass. E-Trade Group Inc., the Menlo Park, Calif. on-line broker, pushed for the California bill, bringing the issue to the attention of state Sen. John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San Jose. Sen. Vasconcellos introduced the proposal in February, and it passed the Senate July 15. San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., the leading Internet brokerage, also offered input on the law's definition of a digital signature, according to Sen. Vasconcellos' chief of staff, Rand Martin. Schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level, however, a spokesman for the company said. \"This action is a step in the right direction,\" the spokesman said. \"But the real objective would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the use of digital signatures.\" E-Trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its transactions with customers in all 50 states, but the Schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond California is \"murky.\" E-Trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law applying across the country. Mr. Smedinghoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's electronic commerce division, said the only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated that a contract was governed by the laws of California. Legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state. For example, Connecticut law covers only medical records at hospitals, while Illinois makes electronic signatures applicable to all communications. In 19995 California became one of the early adopters of digital signature legislation, but that legislation was limited to communication with government agencies. Utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter, with a comprehensive law that preceded California's in 19995 and resulted in the pioneering designation of Digital Signature Trust Co., a Zions Bancorp. subsidiary, as a licensed certificate authority. To bring consistency at the federal level, Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) this year introduced two bills addressing the issue. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act sets out to clarify the legal status of electronic signatures in general, while the Electronic Securities Transaction Act focuses on the securities industry. http:///www.americanbanker.com   Contact: http:///www.americanbanker.com\n"

If we have already satisfactorily concluded the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will be approved.   It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet been researched that we are withholding approval.   The due diligence required involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the utility's counsel.   We usually begin that process only when a trader believes there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to justify the time and expense.   FYI, the due diligence process has in the past revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.Louise Kitchen10/06/999 02:46 PMTo: Mark E Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/LON/ECT@ECT, Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Customer DataOn Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October.Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in the system for the launch schedule.ThanksLouiseMark,On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?   ie their decision whether to trade or not.Louise\n"

We have now reformulated our position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will simply be sent to the relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to sign and return any documents.We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the ETA by stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL system will mean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master agreement.   We do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the ETA.   Obviously for this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented with the 'Accept GTC' button at the usual juncture in the system. In addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating that we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the credit provisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty accept the GTC over the master!!!).Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.   I also presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in this way will be effective under New York law. Best regards,Edmund.\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nThis issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade governed by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).   What do you think about Edmund's solution?Mark---"

I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date.   They do have the advantage of being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.   I don't think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest material.The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.   The first time the counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an \"I Agree\" box after scrolling through the agreement.   The GTC's are the contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master agreement in place.   Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.   While most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our \"Omnibus\" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a \"Deemed ISDA.\"   One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call for collateral if we choose.\n"

I have had several conversations with them concerning this however, they have requested that we provide som sort of legal framework which will allow them to transact under one ID for seperate companies.   Mark has discussed this with outside counsel and are comfortable with such an arrangement.   Essentially the document would state that physical transactions done under ID XX will be with Aquila Energy Marketing and financial transactions done under ID XX will be with Aquila Risk Management.   Please let me know if we can proceed with this type of document.   The only other alternatives at this point are to 1.) assign transacations as they are completed 2.) remove execute rights according to the company. \n"

Since Enron North America will be the Enron contracting entity for all of the transactions, I have expanded the documents to allow for European as well as U.S. transactions and to allow for multiple weather station (index) deals or single weather station deals.   The option forms work for either a put or call but that has to be specified on the web site.   I think it would make sense for one of the weather commercial people to take a quick look at the forms to make sure they agree that they work.   I'm hoping to sit down with Mark Dilworth in the morning to make sure the long descriptions are complete - when you look at these forms, it is clear that a number of defined terms have to be covered on the web site: Premium, Effective Date, Termination Date, Reference Weather Station(s), Fallback Reference Weather Station(s), Reference Basis, Reference Degrees (C or F), Strike Amount, Notional Amount and Maximum Payout Limit are the terms I have identified so far.Please Note - these are NOT ready to be uploaded to the system!   There are blanks for the weather agencies for the European deals - these are not referenced in the earlier UK drafts and I don't know who the appropriate agencies are.   I have not spelled out the data sources for the European transactions either.Mark\n"

After not following my plan afew times due to lack of discipline, my account suffered.But now, I have been winning the \"discipline battle\" thelast 6 trades and my account is at an all-time high.Thanks. Trey***Jim, Thank you for your news letter.   I have always traded options,but never with the confidence and success that I have since Isubscribed.   I have turned $5,000.000 into over $42,5000.000 in threeweeks!   AOL and CSCO have been great. Keep up the great work.Sincerely, Andrew***You guys are the best. No only do you help us make some bucksbut you are very responsive to all of our requests. Tell me,how do you pick so many good stocks?Sincerely, Ron***Jim,   this is the first email I have sent to any newsletter andI have tried many. i am a very highly pleased customer of yournewletter. Even though I started only a month ago, I have seensome gains for the first time ever. Thanks for the good work. Kumar***Thanks for your service I made over $5,000 last week on AOL.Keep up the good work.   You are the best on the internet.   Regina***I like the password this week. I made $7,000 on AOL this week alone!Thanks, David***I just wanted to let you know you have done a great job for me.I have made $10,000 profit in just one week!!!   AOL, CMGI, YHOO,and CSCO have all been good picks.   I am signing up for youryearly subscription.   Thanks, and I look forward to working withyou! -Jason***Thanks for being there!!! I have turned a $20,000 investmentaccount into a $30,000 investment account with 20 days!   Allbecause of the Option Investor Newsletter!   Keep it up!!!Thanks! Doug***I have traded about 20 calls, and YTD annual ROI about5000 %, pretty fair return if I can keep it up a year, Thanks Don***Once again, I just want to say how much I enjoy the newsletter.You and your team do an outstanding job. I also subscribe toother newsletters such as McMillan's \"Option Strategist\", so Iappreciate quality when I see it. Your newsletter is first rate!Thanks, David***Your newsletter is the best I have ever received.   Over thepast two years I have spent hundreds of dollars on newsletters.This is by far the best and the only one I have made money from.I am so excited about your newsletter that I am telling lots offriends.   I also think you give conservative advise that Iappreciate.   I am very conservative and it has taken me twoyears to realize that I could do options.   With your help I havealready been successful in one week!   We own lots of Dell stockbut the options are even more fun to watch go up.   I also followWLA, GPS, and CSCO very closely.   We also own those stocks.Options make a lot of sense to me when I'm familiar with thestocks and know how they act.   I guess earnings season is alsoa very good time to own options.   I am nervous about doingoptions after the earnings season.   Claudia***The Option Investor has been an enormous help in my buddingtrading career.   In fact, it is the first source of informationI've bought (and I've spent thousands on books, workshops, andother website subscriptions)where I can demonstrate a directand nearly immediate link between the information and actualfinancial success in trading.More importantly than this perhaps is your forthright statementabout the importance of what I would call maintaining theintegrity of the relationship between you and your customers.You are clearly a \"straight shooter\", and this is as apparentin the no nonsense approach you are taking to the websitecheating problem as it is in the advice you provide in thenewsletter. Bruce***I cannot tell you how much I support you in your actions.The people who abuse the system are not only taking advantageof you, but of all of us who are willing to pay the VERYreasonable amount for what we get.   The return on my investmenthas been several hundred times over the amount I give youand personally I thank you for taking these steps.Thank you, Lloyd***Dear Jim: I just wanted to let you know you have done a greatjob for me.   I have made $10,000 profit in just one week!!!   AOL,YHOO, and CSCO have all been good picks.   I am signing upfor your yearly subscription.   Thanks, and I look forward toworking with you! -Jason***Thanks so much for your wonderful newsletter!   I adore it andhave made some good money this week on MSFT, CSCO, etc.   Irecommend you to everyone, even told my Schwab5000 team aboutyour newsletter.   I can't thank you enough.With gratitude, Kim***guys, I'm getting richer ever day keep up the good work. I amtest driving the lexus today if AOL keeps going I'll buy anextra one for the lawn guy - bgoose***hello big guy, I just signed up a few weeks ago, and I havebeen able to pay off my credit card with that mafia intrestrate, a tune of over 3000.000 bucks the next victum is mysecond mortage, of 25 gs,   this is my goal for this   year,oh yeah this is buying two or three contracts, the oh, if Ihad bought 10 or 20 contracts id be having lunch with berkshirehathaway. Feel free to use this if you like. Thanks   NODOZ***Jim: I want to thank you and compliment your service.   Pleasefeel free to post my unsolicited remarks below as a referenceto your Newsletter Service.   Thanks for the followup on the Japan market sentiment.It's great to know that when there is a big market event youare on top of things for us.   I subscribed a few weeks ago andwant to say that I am most satisfied with the newsletter.   I was experienced with stocks and options before I subscribed,but I was kind of \"trading in the dark,\" with a lack of self-confidence in my strategies.   Now with the newsletter, I foundthat I was pursuing the right strategies but didn't have theconfidence and trading skills to perform good executions.   Theconfidence gained through the Option Investor Newsletter and thetime saved in searching for opportunities (great opportunity playsalready summarized by the newsletter) has helped me focus on \"betterexecution.\"   My results have improved dramatically.   Since earlyJune when I started the two-week-trial, my option brokerage accountnet worth has increase from $20,000 to $70,000 today.   I alsobelieve that I am trading a lot smarter, actually incurring muchless risk than before.Thanks, Tony***Dear James: I would like to take a moment to thank you for thejob that you and the Option Investor staff do.   I am sure we(subscribers) don't know half of what you guys must contendwith day in and day out to get the newletter to us.   However,do know that you are appreciated.   I must readily admit that I am totally addicted.   I lookforward to Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday nights.   I am like achild at Christmas time.   When I first subscribed to yournewsletter I was somewhat unfamiliar with your format andrecommendations.   I would pick half hazardly and not plan myexecution strategy.   However, as I sat back and analyzed yourpicks, paper traded for sometime, I then started actual trading.I went from a negative portfolio to a positive within 3 weeks,all the credit going to you guys!   I am still attempting toconcur the art of letting the profits run (I still tend to getout a little too quick), but I am better at stopping out whenthe trade hasn't gone as expected.   Keep up the good work and I look forward to a long lastingrelationship.Thank you, Darrel***Jim:   I just had to write you to tell you that during my firsttwo week free trial, your information made me $2,000 from a$2,000 investment! Needless to say, I subscribed and since thenthe website has made me an additional $2,5000. All of this in lessthan 30 days! I have been to Wade's WIN site free for a weekand your information is much easier to understand and use. Ihaven't been this excited in years! Your site has literallychanged my life!Steve***I am just a lame rookie with options, but I profited nicely($15K) in one week with one trade per your news letter, and itwas not from an Internet stock! I would have profited greaterfrom another transaction if I would have heeded \"pigs get fat ,hogs get slaughtered\". I have more of your suggested options inthe works and am cautiously looking for similar returns! Thanksfor the great information. cb***HI, I have to tell you that \"WE LOVE YOU GUYS\"   Our life revolvesaround Sun., Tue., and Thur. Thoughts, comments.   I know you workhard to get the information out and you do a great job.Thanks for everything,C&amp;C***Hello Jim, Thanks so much for the valuable information!I have been trading stocks for many years, the last year I dugmyself an incredible hole, by investing in small caps.I just started trading options with the encouragement, help andguidance of your newsletter. I was able to recapture my 30 K lossin three weeks!   and my Schwab account is back in   positive territory!This is incredible! I am comfortable now with option trading,using the stop loss and diversification principle coupled withgood research your suggested 'method'   works!Thanks for the advise on the books too!   V.R.***I got my first issue of your FREE two week trial and I can onlysay... I AM EXCITED!!!I took your Sunday recommendations and decided to find out theresults if one were to simply follow your suggestions without anyanalysis of their own...As of Wednesday... over 63% of your calls were in positiveterritory with an overall gain of about 80%...IN 2 DAYS...OUTSTANDING!!!This really excites me because I have some extensive knowledge intechnical analysis, so when I filter your recommendations with thecharts, I should come up with about as close as \"SURE THING\" tradesas I will probably ever get! :)Thanks for the research and the recommendations... keep it up!David G. - NEW subscriber :)***Dear Jim, Your trading rules saved me last week.   I've tradedoptions for years but my success has been twarted by not knowingwhen to get out, staying too long, getting greedy, hoping it wouldgo back up, etc.Well, a trade went the wrong way last week and normally I would havehung on but you say so often, \"If it goes down, sell it\" that itmust have finally sunk in.   Though it was down by 5 for the day,I got out with only losing the previous day's gain thanks to \"TheRules\".I love your site and newsletter. Thanks again.   BB***Dear Jim:Yours is the best I have seen bar none.   I just signed up lastweek after my free trial.   I find your letter friendly and chatty,but not condescending, as some others I won't mention.   And nottoo technical!   Without trying to impress, you have done so.Thanks so much for COF, and CSCO, both of which returned excellentresults for me.   I can't show you a new Jaguar yet, but I think youwill make me much richer. Don H.***Dear Sirs, I've been VERY impressed with your service!   You doexcellent stock and market evaluations.   Your suggested plays areobviously predominantly on target.   Your tutoring and explanationsof your thinking behind your suggestions are so clear and wellexpressed ...AND APPRECIATED.NOTHING else I've come across has helped me more in learning howto go about trading options!   And you've helped me fine tune myapproach to stocks as well.Thanks and keep up the good work!   Ann***Hey!Nice call on Cisco! I bought is at 2.75 as you suggested andsold yesterday at 5 each, for a nice total return of about 80%.Thanks!   Nelson***Please charge my credit card for a quarterly subscription.Thanks. I was about to give up on options having lost over$3000 on my own. With your trial I was able to make that back.Cordially, John***Jim and Crew:I found your site by bouncing around the Internet and have beenimpressed with the results you folks get. Much to my wonder herewas a special alert on Tuesday that just blew me away!When I saw that the email was sent at 4am. I was super impressed.Your crew had been at this all night!I played your recommendations (bought 10 of everything --- no notreally) and made money while having a really great time.I have tried many of the other services that are out there foroption traders BUT NO ONE has the results, refreshing commentary,and right-on picks that your team does.I am pleased to tell you that I am now and dues paying subscriberand happy to be in your hands --- please keep up the good work.Skip***\n"

They are:a. banks;b. non-bank financial institutions (\"NBFI\"); andc. foreign invested enterprises (\"FIE\").Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes.   FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned enterprises (\"WFOE\"); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures (\"SFJV\") and include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.   State-owned enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises   can therefore only transact through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.   So it looks as if China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a year or two ago on these issues.   If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd be happy to send a copy on.\n"

        " Maria Ines Granado/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on10/30/98 08:38 AM ---\"Cochran, Fielding (Tres)\" &lt;fcochran@velaw.com&lt; on 10/30/98 07:07:30 AMTo:   Maria Ines Granado/ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc:Subject:   Petrobras Swap&lt;&lt;ECTOCT2.doc&lt;&lt;Maria,   Please follow this message with the attached file to Gareth.   For some reason I cannot get it to go to Gareth directly.Gareth,Attached is the current draft of the swap confirmation for the Petrobras transaction.   The swap has two components --- the fixed/Libor rate swap and the \"spread\" swap.   The fixed/Libor swap is composed of the amounts computed pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (i) of the definition of floating amount.   The amounts computed pursuant to clauses (iv) and (v) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (ii) of the definition of floating amount is the spread swap.This is going to be a very unusual and highly structured swap in many respects in order to tailor it to the risk sharing that exists in this transaction among Petrobras, the Lenders, and Enron as swap provider. Because the swap includes both the rate swap and the spread swap, the benefits and obligations under the swap will need to be allocated internally at Enron between EI and ECT.   Randy and Scott recommend that a memorandum be generated that will reflect the manner in which this allocation will be made.   Essentially as it is explained to me, ECT will be allocated the benefits and obligations related to the fixed/Libor swap and EI will be allocated the benefits and obligations related to the spread swap.One other feature that EI will be responsible for is the Deferral Amount mentioned in the confirmation.   This arises if a Reserve Deficiency occurs and the Reserve Indemnity is no longer in effect.   In this situation, if any amount is owed to ECT on the rate swap the Company will not have sufficient cash flow to pay the full amount due to ECT and the Lenders.   The Lenders will be deferring a prorata part of their interest and principal, and ECT as swap provider will also have to defer a prorata part of the amount due to it.   The amount to be deferred is called the Deferral Amount in the attached draft.   EI will be responsible for any Deferral Amounts that may arise.   If after a Deferral Amount is generated, the Company is able to recoup any of the Deferral Amount, the portion payable to the Swap Provider under the Participation Agreement would be a \"Makeup Amount\" and would be allocated to EI when received under the swap.A great deal of additional thought and fine tuning will continue to need to be applied to this portion of the transaction to make sure that it coordinates as appropriate with the Credit Agreement, Participation Agreement and Transaction Documents.   Any suggestions that you or the ECT swap lawyers may have would be appreciated.   One thing that would be useful would be a \"breakage clause\" that would describe in as much specificity as posible how the breakage would be computed whenever it is necessary to adjust the notional amounts under the fixed/libor swap.Tres Cochran - ECTOCT2.doc\n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nPets In the Office It's A Growing Trend In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some companies. Workers are bringing their pets to the office.   Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has been taking his golden retriever, Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early Show and talked with Co-Anchor Jane Clayson.   The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. \"He brings a lot of emotion and people love it. He's very relaxed.\"   But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to the office if he wishes. Not everybody can bring their pet to work.   \"A lot of it depends on the dog,\" says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not a rowdy dog.   \"He just hangs out,\" explains Paucek. \"He's easy to get along with.\"   Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, \"My wife brings him in and drops him off at the office,\" Paucek says.   While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also many legal issues to consider. John Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend of bringing pets to the work place is really growing.   \"More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their working place employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace,\" says Challenger   He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and employees need to explore before they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy.   \"One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a policy like that, is take a poll of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain employees that don't feel comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy.\"   There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be liable if a dog or cat bites or scratches another employee.   \"The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of policy in effect,\" says Challenger. \"The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites someone or the cat scratches someone, it can't be the company's fault.\"   Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office.   \"Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, will you put them in a certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? Many don't feel comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats and dogs and what about birds? What about the noise of birds?\"   Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, \"It gets chaotic.\"   In 19997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,2225 pet owners. They found that:   21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work   76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the job   333% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should:   poll employees before they let the pets come   provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome in the office   establish an off-limits-to-pets area   make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated   bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office   tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should make a rotating schedule.   When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when he and Hoss arrive at work, \"I get off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the employees. He has his own web page.\"\n"

If any of you care to voice your opinion about Height Blvd. the best   person to speak to is:   Mignette Dorsey, City of Houston Bikeway Coordinator   713-837-0003   I spoke to her and found out that this has been planned since the   early 90's (see how fast our government works).   She said that she   has received several complaints but the project will continue until   completion (they have to put down the bike symbols) before it would   be reconsidered.   If you don't like the restriped Heights Blvd. I   suggest you call Ms. Dorsey and email the following:   Jeff King - Public Works   wjohnson@pwe.ci.houston.tx.us   Robert Litke - Planning &amp; Development Dept   rlitke@pd.ci.houston.tx.us   Annise Parker - City Councilwoman   aparker@cnl.ci.houston.tx.us   Thanks!!!   Gordon Hagendorf   &lt; On another issue, I don't know if you've driven down Height   Blvd. lately   &lt; but they turned it into one lane (yes only one lane) and made a   side   &lt; bike lane.   I don't like it and think it's unsafe.   I've written   the   &lt; following email to Ms. A. Parker and would appreciate if you   would   &lt; share it with any Heights residents to see if they feel the   same.   &lt; Thanks very much, miss ya,   &lt;   &lt; Gordon   &lt;   &lt;   &lt; Dear. Ms. Parker,   &lt;   &lt;   &lt; I would like to know who I should address a complaint about the   way   &lt; Heights Blvd. has been turned into one lane with a bike lane and   parking   &lt; taking up what used to be a driving lane. I do not like the   re-striping   &lt; for the following reasons:   &lt;   &lt;   &lt;   1.   There is too much traffic for one lane.   &lt;   &lt;   &lt;   2.   It is now very difficult and dangerous to cross Heights   Blvd.   &lt;   from one of the side streets because the line of cars is   much   &lt;   longer (since there's only one lane). Cars are having   having to   &lt;   shoot across very quickly to make it to the other side.   &lt;   &lt;   &lt;   3.   Cars are using the bike lane as a driving lane making it   very   &lt;   dangerous for bicyclist.   &lt;   &lt;   &lt;   4.   We have too much parking on Heights Blvd. and this only   &lt;   encourages many more people to park there. This will also   &lt;   encourage large trucks to park on Heights Blvd. making it   very   &lt;   unsafe.   &lt;   &lt;   &lt;   5.   The more cars that park on Heights Blvd. the less   attractive the   &lt;   area looks. All of the cars parked along the street take   away from   &lt;   the historic beauty of the area.   &lt;   &lt;   &lt;   6.   Besides all of the above, why do we need a bike lane for   only 2   &lt;   miles? It would be much safer for the bikers to use any of   the   &lt;   side streets in the neighborhood to bike the short 2 miles   between   &lt;   I10 &amp; 20th street.   &lt;   &lt;   &lt; Is there anyway to have this reversed? Thanks very much for time   and   &lt; attention. I really do appreciate you time,   &lt;   &lt;   &lt; Gordon Hagendorf   &lt; 713-270-2450 Day   &lt; 713-861-08885 Night&lt; \n"

As I would ultimately like for someone from legal to officially sign off on something like this, please review with that in mind.   Thanks very much.   Please call   me if you have questions or comments.   \"All FX deals are to be verbally confirmed as soon as possible after the trade is executed.   A comment should be written on the deal ticket noting who the deal was confirmed with and the date and time.   Once a deal has been verbally confirmed, and entered into TAGG, deals with an expiration within one week of the trade date should be sent to the file room.   If the deal has settlements beyond one week from   the trade date, a confirmation should be generated based on the template for that particular counterparty.   All intercompany deals should be paper confirmed.   In the event that we are unable to verbally confirm a transaction by the end of trade date + one, a written confirmation should be generated and sent to the counterparty.   Any discrepancies noted when verbally confirming should be brought to the traders attention.\"Thanks.   LEt me know what you think.\n"

We will need your approval on the wording that was suggested for the long description and other legal sign-off. I have already gone through the product descriptions with Andrea and no mayor comments came up. Regarding Natural Gas products, her comments were that we are creating a Firm product with TOP 1000%, but that is OK. Then on the additional information like delivery points, term, currency and unit of measure, all those alternatives have been given to Dale for him to load into the system.Please give me an update on your timetable for these issues.RegardsPatrick\n"

This definition, I believe, describes agreements like the ISDA Master   Agreement.2) Both versions amend Section 362(b) (the exceptions to the automatic stay) to provide for a concept that permits setoffs with respect to amounts due and claims under one or more master netting agreements or any contract or agreement that is subject to such master netting agreements.   Mark and I think that through this provsion, cross-product netting would be permitted to the extent our physical and financial contracts separately or collectively come under a master netting agreement.   We wanted to confirm that that was the intent of this language since it is not entirely clear from the drafted language how this would work if for example we had separate netting agreements for our physical and financial contracts.   In addition, as currently drafted, the only caveat to this setoff right is that these rights are derivative of the setoff rights that are permitted by Sections 362 (b) 6 (forward contarcts), 7 (repos) and 17 (swaps) with respect to each individual contract.   This may still present some problems for us in that no amendments were made to Section 362 (b) 6 which permits setoffs with respect to forward contracts but only to the extent that our claim against the debtor is for a margin payment or a settlement payment .   We were hoping to see an amendment to this Section that   broadened this language to include any type of payment that would be due from the debtor under a forward contract   since we are still unclear as to what a \"settlement\" payment means.   If you look at Section 362 (b) 17 which deals with swaps, this language is much broader and it was our hope that the setoff language for forward contracts could track the setoff language for swaps.   Also, we were hoping that the setoff language for forward contarcts would apply to anyone taht was a party to a forward contract and not just \"forward contract merchants\" as currently drafted.   Again, the swap setoff language has a concept of \"swap participant\" that is much broader.3) Finally, we like the fact that the definition of \"swap agreement\" was expanded, but are concerned with the new language and how it would apply to our newer products such as weather derivatives since in order to fit within the new definition, it must be something that is currently or in the future \"regularly\" entered into in the swap market.   There are some further revisions to that definition which I want to discuss with you as well.In summary, while this language gives us some stronger argumants with respect to \"cross-product\" netting, we feel that it doesn't go far enough.   Mark has called Cadwalader to get their read on the draft language.   Call me when convenient so that we can discuss what the next step for us may be.Carol \n"

        " Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT on 07/08/999 03:15 PM ---Mark Elliott02/23/999 10:03 AMTo: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan B Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Sefton/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in IndiaMark, Further to my e-mail to you of last week on the above subject, I have now reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local Indian Counsel (Crawford Bailey &amp; Co.) on the above topic in January 19997.   That due diligence reveals the following:Prior Reserve Bank of India (\"RBI\") approval required to do business in India:   If   Enron is considered to be \"doing business in India\" (which it would, for example, if we had a branch or entity there) we shall require the prior consent of the   RBI under Section 29 (1) (a) Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1973 (\"FERA\") e.g. to set up the branch or entity.   Please note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel (14th January, 19997), Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain approval from the RBI to do business in India.   This needs to be revisited as to the requirements.Repatriation of proceeds / Exchange Control:   Please note that in the approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI, such approval would state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated e.g., to the USA, or not.   I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it.   We also need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation.   FX / Interest Rate dealings:A. It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate Products for the Enron Group (i.e., an internal Treasury Desk) to trade with dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the RBI.   B. FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by the FERA.   Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA.   It is not clear what are the exact ramifications of   dealings in contravention of FERA; this needs to be investigated. C. What are the Rules of FERA (see A above)?   It appears that the RBI requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates, and authorised dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated deals.   The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the dealer.   It appears, however, that there was a relaxation of the Rules shortly before the 19997 due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a back-to-back basis without seeking the approval of the RBI.   These transactions are the following:1. Interest Rate Swaps.2. Currency Swaps.3. Coupon Swaps.4. Purchase of Interest Rate CAPS/Collars.5. Forward rate agreements. In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers are required to ensure that:(i) The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying loan transactions.(ii) The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the outstanding amount of the loan.(ii) The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to maturity of the underlying loan(iv)   The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved (a once and for all basis is sufficient) the relevant financial limits and the authorised designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions.Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of underlying \"loan\" transactions.   Hence query, e.g., whether a simple currency swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption - and if not, query how one obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this.   This needs to be investigated.   If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a transaction.   Speculative transactions are void:   Please note that transactions entered into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section 30 of the Indian Contract Act 1872.   Indian counsel opines that provided the rate or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid. Capacity and Authority: It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that the transactions were covered by its objects' clause and similarly that our counterparties' objects' clauses covered the products in which we wish to deal - there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside their capacity.   Furthermore, in relation to authority to enter into transactions, it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties' documentation in this regard.   Derivatives and Borrowings:   If we were to establish a company in India, we would be subject to the Companies Act 1956 in relation to limitation on the quantum of monies which it could borrow.   Any borrowing in excess of stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the company in general meeting.   Accordingly, in relation to derivatives' transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency, one would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by the members of the company in general meeting. The power to borrow itself, must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors. Collateral: It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided / received, for example, in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India, would be legal, valid and binding, as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its insolvency; however, the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge, pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance.   The due diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due diligence consider outright transfers of collateral (e.g., under English law) rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral situated locally in India;   these issues need to be checked. Choice of Law and Arbitration:   It would appear that Indian entities may enter into agreements (e.g., ISDA Masters) governed by New York or US law and it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work.Insurance business:   Indian counsel opined that interest rate/FX derivative transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India.Income Tax:   Please note that if an Enron entity, or a branch of an Enron entity, was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake such business, then any income arising to the Enron entity / branch in India from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax.   Please note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA, UK and Singapore with India.   However, no details of rates of taxation or further explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in the opinion.Gross-Up Clauses:   Contractual gross-up clauses re withholdings (e.g., the standard gross-up clause in the ISDA Master) would need to be approved by the RBI.   Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved. Close-out netting:   Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel, the existing due diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum (e.g., if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a close-out against them in their insolvency).   This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel.Oral Contracts:   Please note that in relation to oral contracts, whilst it is possible to sue upon an oral contract in India, it is not possible to take any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the permission of the RBI under section 47 of FERA.   Indian counsel does not state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to obtain. Mark, I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above before I take any further action on the above.Kind regardsMarkApart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a subsidiary in India, and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the US any proceeds of such business, there did not appear to be any other trade control or other laws which would inhibit Enron's ability to do business in India. \n"

        " Mark Elliott/LON/ECT on 02/03/999 111:41 AM ---Mark Elliott02/02/999 06:333 PMTo: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Sefton/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Proposed London Equity Trading DeskI have reviewed the above proposal (which includes having had some in-depth conference calls with Slaughter &amp; May, London) and conclude that the project is technically and legally viable provided that the points listed below are dealt with.   Mark, once you have read this note, if you would like to discuss the contents with Scott and me, please do not hesitate to give us a call.SFA Authorisation and StructureOn account of the potential frequency and size of trading (even on an execution-only basis for ECT Investments Inc), the London Desk should be authorised by the SFA.   The personnel involved in the activity should be registered with the SFA as, at least, Securities Representatives, and preferably as General Representatives.   Accordingly, subject to Tax Department's input, the London traders should be located in EEFT (already SFA-regulated) which would act as arranger or agent for the existing Houston-based equity trading corporation, ECT Investments, Inc (the latter as principal).Subject to Tax and other internal considerations, it would also be possible for EEFT to act as agent to do this business for, as principal, either ECTRIC, the proposed replacement vehicle for ECTRIC,   or a new UK unregulated entity (the latter would apply if a UK book was required).   A UK entity, as principal, would be \"unregulated\" if it was a purely passive booking company.Provided that the ultimate principal is either ECT Investments, Inc., ECTRIC or an unregulated UK principal, there should not be any UK regulatory capital requirements.The SFA would need to be informed in advance of our intention to have an equity trading capability in London and EEFT's SFA business profile would need to be extended to cover both arranging and dealing as agent in respect of equities.Transaction Reporting   As the business would be SFA regulated per the above, SFA Rule 5-49 would require all transactions to be \"Transaction Reported\" - for pure cash equity business (wherever the equities are listed) this would be accomplished by computer-entry of trade details which would then download to one of the London Stock Exchange's (\"LSE's\") systems known as either \"SEQUAL\" or \"CHECKING\".The purpose of such reporting   is not only to enable the LSE and SFA to establish daily market volumes, etc.,   but also, for example, to provide the relevant information to the LSE's surveillance unit which actively monitors all trades for signs of Insider Dealing.Systems' impact On the above structure, there should be no extra systems' requirements, except:- PC screens for the traders having feeds of market quotes / market information (e.g., Reuters, Telerate, etc):potentially a computer-link for settlement purposesa computer-link for the Transaction Reporting of executed deals to the LSE (see above)a computer-link to produce exception reports of executed deals to enable a Compliance Department to monitor for Disclosable Interests in Shares (see below) a computer-link to produce reports of executed deals for monitoring against the Watch and Restricted Lists (see Insider Dealing below)Accountants, e.g., Arthur Andersen, would be the best placed to advise on the correct form of computer-links, especially those for Transaction Reporting purposes.Disclosure of Interests in shares   Re UK listed companies there are the following disclosures to be made of equity interests:-S. 198 Companies Act '85 - acquisition of 3 % interest or more, or disposal to below a 3% interest, or acquisition of each whole % above a 3% interest of a UK Public Co's voting capital requires to be disclosed to the company.   Group interests / concert party interests are aggregated to arrive at the thresholds and \"interest\" includes a right or option to acquire shares.Substantial Acquisition Rules - acquisition of over 15% interest in a UK public company requires separate disclosure to the Company and, if listed, to the LSE.Rule 9 Takeover Code - acquisition of 30 % or more of UK public company's voting shares leads to a requirement to make a cash offer for the remainder.S. 212 Companies Act '85 - UK public companies can request at any time an entity to disclose to the company particulars of their, and other persons', interests in the company's share capital, including such details for the last three years.Rule 8.3 Takeover Code - during an \"offer period\" relating to a UK public company (and the offer is a \"securities exchange offer\"), persons owning or controlling directly or indirectly 1% or more of relevant securities of that company (including cash-settled derivatives) must disclose such interests to the Take-Over Panel.Please note that there may be similar rules in other jurisdictions, depending on where the relevant equities are listed - indeed in some jurisdictions there may be   prohibitions on foreign ownership of equities. Insider Dealing   Looking just to the UK legislation (The Criminal Justice Act 19993), the various criminal offences of Insider Dealing are committed, basically, when an individual has Inside Information (meaning unpublished price-sensitive information) concerning the securities of an entity or entities (whether UK or non-UK) which are officially listed in any State within the European Economic Area or admitted to dealing, or quoted, on a \"Regulated Market\" (e.g., including the major European markets, NASDAQ, etc).   Please note that \"price-sensitive\"   means likely to have a significant effect on the price of any securities - not just those of the entity or entities in respect of which one has the knowledge; and \"securities\" includes shares, debentures, options to subscribe for shares / debentures, depository receipts, futures and CFDs.   Once in knowledgeable possession of insider information, the offences are commited if one deals in price-affected securities in relation to   that information, or encourages another to so deal or discloses the information.   The offence is punishable by imprisonment and / or fines.   The offences are highly technical and there are certain defences available.   The manner in which to try to prevent the internal commission of the offences is to put in place, simply, \"established and effective\" Chinese Walls between those individuals who would be involved in the Equity Trading facility and others in within the Enron Group who may have such inside information, to prevent the potential flows of Inside Information between those with such information and the Equity Traders in London.   Both I and Slaughter &amp; May feel that potentially replicating in London the Enron Chinese Wall   policy actively followed in Houston could suffice in this respect as it is generally felt that the US requirements should be at least as stringent as those required in the UK.   Alan Aronowitz is in the process of   sending me Houston's policy in this regard for review and upon receipt that policy will be reviewed accordingly.However, the relevant Chinese Walls would need to be put in place for Insider Dealing purposes between, in my and Slaughters' views, (a) on the one side, the Equity Traders and (b) on the other side, originators and traders, and persons involved in any corporate finance, M&amp;A, Joint Venture, and financing   activity.   Not only would the Chinese Walls need to be implemented, but also they would need to be actively monitored by a Compliance Department in London to ensure that they were being observed and effective.In addition to the Houston Chinese Wall policy, there should be implemented both a \"Watch List\" and a \"Restricted List\" procedure (I understand the latter already exists and would need to be combined with additions to such list in London ) - the Watch List does not actively prevent trading in relevant securities, but is an intermediate step before a stock is placed on the Restricted List: i.e., companies in which Enron is involved in sensitive transactions would be placed on such a list and an internal Compliance Department should then actively monitor for any unusual deals by the Equity Traders (e.g., by volume etc) in stocks of the Companies on   such list.   If any irregular trading activity is then spotted - it could be internally investigated.   Obviously, an internal procedure would need to be established to gather information on sensitive transactions so that they could be placed on the Watch / Restricted Lists as appropriate.Other Confidential InformationIn addition to any specific Insider Information, various Enron Group entities will be party to specific Confidentiality Agreements (or other forms of Agreement, e.g., Master Agreements, containing confidentiality clauses) with third parties, pursuant to which the Enron entities may have confidentiality obligations to those third parties and which may prevent the contracting Enron entities from disclosing certain information to affiliated Enron entities.Obviously, in order to comply with our various obligations in this regard we would need either to check each contract or ensure that Enron personnel were aware of their obligations in this regard and never disclosed to the London Equity traders any information covered by the confidentiality obligations.   The Watch List could be used to log, for monitoring purposes, companies to whom Enron owes confidentiality obligations.   Both with regard to Insider Information and this form of confidential information, employees would need to be actively trained to ensure that only generally available market sentiment on a third party could be passed on to the London Equity traders and not more specific information.   Compliance Department If this proposal moves ahead, my suggestion is that Enron in London would need to hire an experienced   Compliance professional for the following purposes:-active implementation of, review of, and consistent monitoring of, the Chinese Wall policy;active monitoring of executed deals against Watch and Restricted Lists;active monitoring of executed deals for Disclosable Interests in Shares in the UK and similar rules and prohibitions in other jurisdictions;handling SFA and   LSE queries on Transaction Reporting; handling potential LSE and Takeover Panel queries on executed Transactions; andrunning continuous training courses for Enron personnel on Insider Dealing, confidentiality obligations, etc.   In addition, such person could have responsibility for the implementation of, monitoring of, and ensuring compliance with, SFA Conduct of Business Rules and Moneylaundering compliance, and any relevant exchange rules, firm-wide in London across all of Enron's business - e.g., its OTC Derivatives' business.

        " Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT on 02/08/999 09:17 AM ---Mark Elliott02/05/999 04:15 AMTo: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Sefton/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: London Equities Trading Desk - US legal adviceFurther to my Questionnaire to Maureen Bartlett at Cadwalader on the applicability of U.S. securities' laws in the context of a London Equities' Desk, I received Maureen's responses in a lengthy telephone call yesterday afternoon.   I shall only comment where according to Maureen we shall have to be mindful of an issue - where I do not comment, Maureen said the answer to the Question was \"no\" (i.e., good news for us).   Hence, Maureen's advice:-Q 6 - Generally, ECTII would only bear responsibility to US regulatory authorities for EEFT's acts and omissions if ECTII was a \"knowing co-conspirator\" in an EEFT act or omission which violated US securities' laws.   EEFT would not have any responsibility for its acts and omissions to any US regulatory authority.   EEFT would not have any responsibility to US regulatory authorities for any acts or omissions of ECTII except again only to the extent that it may have colluded with ECTII.   The only exceptions to these positions are set out below.   Q 7 - U.S. disclosure requirements re interests in equities - where initially EEFT acts as pure arranger without any discretion for ECTII (i.e., pure execution-only facility in London), the U.S. disclosure requirements will be down to ECTII to comply with (as the principal).   This will still be the case if EEFT moves to having agency authority (i.e., having discretion) to book trades to ECTII - the only difference here is that there will need to be extra careful monitoring to ensure that EEFT does not do a deal in a stock out of London which, when aggregated with other Enron Group interests in that stock, take us over a disclosable amount (e.g., under s 13d SEA '34, a 5 % holding of a stock registered under s 12 SEA '34; and 10 % under s 16a SEA '34).   This will mean that we shall need extra careful use and monitoring of Watch and Restricted Lists between London and Houston and may be London having a policy preventing acquisition by the London desk of a large block of stock (to be defined) in any U.S. entity without Houston's consent.Q 8 + Q 9 - U.S. Insider Dealing laws apply to (a) stock of U.S. issuers and (b) stock of non-U.S. issuers listed in the U.S...   EEFT would not be liable under U.S. Insider Dealing laws unless it knew that it had price-sensitive information (as defined under U.S. laws) and dealt in either (a) or (b) or encouraged another to deal, etc.   ECTII   would not be liable vicariously to the US authorities for EEFT in this respect - ECTII would have to have committed the offence itself, e.g. by having the knowledge then dealing etc or colluding with EEFT.   Vice versa applies re ECTII - EEFT.   Basically this comes down, once again, to having adequate. and well monitored Chinese Walls, procedures, education of staff re what they can and cannot do etc.   As well as other Chinese Walls, obviously ECTII staff would not be able to pass price-sensitive information which is not publicly known to EEFT staff and vice versa.Q 10 + 111 - Re Reg S new issues.   As ECTII would be the principal and is in the US, not only is ECTII directly prevented from buying a Reg S offering within the lock-out period but so would EEFT as ECTII's arranger / agent.   If EEFT purchased a Reg S offering within the lock-out period, ECTII would have broken the rules.   Obviously this would have to go into the compliance manual governing EEFT's conduct and again London trading would need to be actively monitored for compliance.I still firmly believe that there is nothing in the above advice which makes a London equities' facility for Houston legally and technically difficult - it comes down to Chinese Walls, policies and procedures and active daily monitoring by a compliance department of the activities of the London desk.Maureen will shortly be sending me her written confirmation of the advice which she gave me over the telephone.Kind regardsMark   \n"

The idea would be to talk about e-commerce in the energy business.   Specifically, Enron might propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.   We would probably discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?Should legal counsel be in attendance?Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?\n"

We've gone to some lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long Description contain all of the necessary terms.   It's not clear to me that we intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of Commercial Terms.

Below is a&lt; list of initial&lt; questions regarding which we would be grateful for the&lt; benefit of your advice.&lt; For your background information as you consider these&lt; questions, be advised that&lt; counterparties must sign a written \"Password Application\"&lt; which provides that&lt; the counterparty intends to be bound by agreements entered&lt; into by \"clicking\" in&lt; the appropriate spaces on the website.   Please feel free to&lt; contact me with any&lt; questions you may have.   I can be reached either by e-mail at&lt; Mark.Taylor@enron.com or by telephone at (713)853-7459.&lt;&lt; 1.   Have relevant regulators in your jurisdiction made any&lt; statements regarding&lt; marketing of or dealing in any of the following types of&lt; products through the&lt; internet or other electronic systems:&lt;&lt;   Commodity transactions relating to oil, gas, electricity&lt; or other energy&lt; commodities, whether derivative&lt;   transactions (cash settled) or physically settled.&lt;   Financial derivatives - i.e. interest rate, foreign&lt; exchange or credit&lt; derivatives.&lt;   Weather derivatives.&lt;   If so, please could you provide us with a brief summary.Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connectionwith the marketing or dealing in the above types of   products through theinternet or other electronic systems from publicly available source.   We willet you know if we find any previous or future statements.&lt;&lt; 2.   Do any specific laws or regulations exist in your&lt; jurisdiction which would&lt; prevent or in any way impact upon marketing or trading of any&lt; of the products&lt; set out in question 1 above through the internet?   In&lt; answering this question&lt; please address issues relating to contractual formation and&lt; enforceability of&lt; contracts entered into via the internet.   In particular, if a&lt; transaction&lt; entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or&lt; U.K. law and the&lt; transactions contain a choice of such law, will such&lt; transactions, including the&lt; choice of law, be enforceable in Japan?We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or tradingof any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.   UnderJapanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers oracceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties maymake most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishingthat the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In mostsimple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy toprove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller'selectronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy productY should be enough in this context.In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should becarefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to thequestion of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, thelegal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may besomewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over thecounter).   Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases theproduct. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click onan Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, with acarefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able tolet the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on theicon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms andconditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrapin the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that thecustomer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly maybe more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or U.K.law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.&lt;&lt; 3.   If the answer to either of question 1 or 2 is \"yes\",&lt; please indicate&lt; whether the impact of any relevant statements, laws or&lt; regulations will differ&lt; depending upon whether (a) the relevant internet site is&lt; maintained in your&lt; jurisdiction or elsewhere; or (b) the party effecting the&lt; marketing/trading&lt; through the internet is locally licensed.N/A&lt; 4.   Please confirm that by marketing to or trading with&lt; counterparts in your&lt; jurisdiction via the internet local relevant regulatory&lt; bodies/local laws or&lt; regulations will not consider the party maintaining the&lt; relevant website to have&lt; established a physical establishment/branch in your jurisdiction.We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,regulations, or court cases.   So long as   the party maintains the relevantwebsite with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of Japaneseregulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such websiteestablished a \"physical\" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.&lt;&lt; Thank you in advance for your attention.   We look forward to&lt; hearing from you.&lt;&lt; Sincerely,&lt;&lt; Mark Taylor&lt;&lt; \n"

UnderJapanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers oracceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties maymake most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishingthat the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In mostsimple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy toprove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller'selectronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy productY should be enough in this context.In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should becarefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to thequestion of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, thelegal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may besomewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over thecounter).   Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases theproduct. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click onan Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, with acarefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able tolet the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on theicon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms andconditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrapin the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that thecustomer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly maybe more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or U.K.law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.&lt;&lt; 3.   If the answer to either of question 1 or 2 is \"yes\",&lt; please indicate&lt; whether the impact of any relevant statements, laws or&lt; regulations will differ&lt; depending upon whether (a) the relevant internet site is&lt; maintained in your&lt; jurisdiction or elsewhere; or (b) the party effecting the&lt; marketing/trading&lt; through the internet is locally licensed.N/A&lt; 4.   Please confirm that by marketing to or trading with&lt; counterparts in your&lt; jurisdiction via the internet local relevant regulatory&lt; bodies/local laws or&lt; regulations will not consider the party maintaining the&lt; relevant website to have&lt; established a physical establishment/branch in your jurisdiction.We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,regulations, or court cases.   So long as   the party maintains the relevantwebsite with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of Japaneseregulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such websiteestablished a \"physical\" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.&lt;&lt; Thank you in advance for your attention.   We look forward to&lt; hearing from you.&lt;&lt; Sincerely,&lt;&lt; Mark Taylor&lt;&lt; \n"

For these reasons, we think we should agree&lt; on an ISDA where conditions acceptable to both parties can apply to the&lt; intense trading between the two companies.&lt;&lt; In order to speed up the process, I have enclosed to this message Dow's&lt; template for the ISDA Schedule. We would appreciate if Enron could review&lt; the attached draft and come back with any comments or issues for&lt; discussion. Please forward this message to the responsible person asking&lt; him to contact me for any discussion.

Essentially, this means that Greg would attend a couple of meetings per year and participate in a handful of telephone conversations all aimed at helping the editors at InternetWeek calibrate themselves in terms of what's important and what's not in the technology world.   Here are the advantages I see:Greg gets to work with several high-level CTO's and technology CEO's who also participate on the board.   This is good exposure for our plans to provide IT services as a business.Good exposure in terms of IT recruiting.   The more high-profile places we are, the better.Good media relations and the potential for us to track editorial thought in the technology world.Philippe had originally planned to do it, but I think we're concluding that it's a perfect place for Greg to be as part of his efforts to put new origination activities in motion.   From my PR perch, I see no conflicts but Greg is right to suggest that we run it by you first.   Ok with you?Vance MeyerDirector, Media RelationsVance Meyer, Enron Corp.(713) 345 44459---",

UrgentWeather Derivative Advice ...(Document link: Jane   McBride)   Dear Alan and Mark,   I am going to need you to help me make a risk decision.   Iwelcome input   from Mark Evans but he may be more comfortable leaving this upto Alan and   Mark because Alan and Mark have been involved in this gamblingissue from   the beginning.   Jeremy Pitts and I have had a brief conversation re my email tohim below,   this afternoon, but he will not be able to get written commentssigned off   by Japanese lawyers to me until Monday.   The situation relates to the Tokyo's office's first weatherderivatives   deal, which is with a company called Toa Reinsurance.   In anutshell the   situation is that negotiations have come to a standstill becauseneither   side can move on their positions re the gambling warranties.The deal of   course though has already been done over the telephone severalweeks ago.   In a nutshell then, based on discussions with Jeremy Pitts, butto be   clarified by Japanese lawyer on Monday, the situation is:   1.   In terms of Enron Japan's ability to trade weatherderivatives here,   we are operating in the grey even if we can get warranty5&amp;copy;(ii) from   them.   2.   ToaRe will not give us the important warranty - 5&amp;copy;(ii)below,   because they say they can't.   They say they are not actually\"entering into   the deal to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinarycourse of   their business\" - which is what the subject warranty says.   B&amp;Mhave   advised that the obtaining of this warranty from a counter partyhelps keep   us in the grey and out of the red in terms of what we are doingand also   gives us comfort that the counter party can do the deal.   3.   ToaRe is, in addition, separately asking us to give themthe same   warranty.   Jane McBride analysis   Re 3 - Given that our legal situation is grey at best, I do notthink we   should be giving the warranty they have requested.   They saythey will not   give us that warranty.   The issue then is whether we can goahead without   getting the warranty from them, bearing in mind that a bindingtelephone   deal has been done.   If you agree with me that we can't give the warranty, then wehave to   decide whether we can go ahead without getting the warrantyreferred to in   (2) above, from them.   I am not sure however that in practice weeven have   a choice given that the trade has been done.   If we go ahead without giving and without getting the warranty,the risk to   us is that we are more likely to be in breach of the prohibitionon   gambling in the Criminal Law.   Are we willing to take this riskand who   needs to give me this answer?   Jane   Jane McBride   To:Jeremy.Pitts@BAKERNET.com   10/20/2000   cc:Paul.TYO.Davis@BakerNet.com, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, John   02:06 PMViverito/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mark Evans/Legal/LON/ECT@ECT, Jonathan   Whitehead/AP/Enron@Enron, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT   Subject:   ... UrgentWeather Derivative Advice ...(Document link: Jane   McBride)   (See attached file:Weather-HDD-Floor-OTC-ToaRejmb2000-10-20!.doc)   Dear Jeremy,   I would like to refine the following instructions.   There aretwo (only)   issues on which we need specific written advice and they bothrelate to   Warranty &amp;copy;(ii) of the draft which says \"XYZ is entering into aweather   derivative transaction to hedge weather related risks arising inthe   ordinary course of its business\".   1.   (a)   Can Enron Japan give the warranty at this stage in itsgrowth?   Have we already had any written advice from you on whether EnronJapan can   warrant along these lines?   If so, when?   If not, the facts seemto be   that:   Enron Japan plans to trade commodities which are energyrelated but   because we are still building up the business we are nottrading these   products yet.   As you know, we are getting into the power market.   If wehave done a   weather derivative, then we can of course offer better priceson the   electricity deals we are negotiating.   Other Enron companies are of course already trading manyweather   dependant commodities and power.   It could be argued therefore that unless we can rely on theweather related   risks of other Enron companies to justify our weather derivative   transacting in these early days, that this is a speculativetransaction   constituting gambling (depending on how the law on this works).It is   understandable that ToaRe would want us to warranty in effectthat we are   not gambling because we are asking them to do so.   I know wehave had sign   off from B&amp;M re our weather derivative trading but I wonder ifanyone   considered what the situation would be before we ourselves hadother   transactions giving us weather related risks.   (b)   If not, how could it be amended so that we can give it?   &amp;copy;   If still relevant in the context of your answers to (a) and(b) above,   they did offer previously to take out all warranties so thatneither party   gives any warranties.   The deal cannot be cancelled because itwas done on   the telephone late Sept.   Accordingly, what is the practicalrisk of us   proceeding without the benefit of any warranties from ToaRe(including the   warranty that they are under the Insurance Business Law - ie aninsurance   company.)?   2.   They are insisting they not give (ii) and that we besatisfied with   (ii) only for the purposes of the Gambling Law   Pls confirm inwriting   whether you think we can still go ahead on this basis.   Thanks.   Jane McBride   Senior Legal Counsel   Enron Japan Corp.   Otemachi 1st Square Bldg.

      "body": "\nInitial thoughts - Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron Japan?Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the word \"ordinary\" or maybe the entire phrase \"in the ordinary course of its business\"?Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or \"no action\" type of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK?   It may not be quick enough to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business.If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade.   If necessary, my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal sanctions issue to Mark H.

Urgent Weather Derivative Advice ...Have spoken with Joe Hirl.   If there was any way we can take advantage of or use for the purposes of establishing Enron Japan weather exposure, all the exposure of other Enron companies, this should help us to establish legitimate weather exposure.   Enron always has weather risk and we keep a global weather book although of course we have open positions sometimes.Obviously we are mostly concerned about criminal liability.It seems to us that if we cant do the first deal, there is no position for market makers here, which just doesn't make sense.Thanks.Jane McBrideSenior Legal CounselEnron Japan Corp.Otemachi 1st Square Bldg.West 111th Floor1-5-1 Otemachi, Chiyoda-kuTokyo 1000-0004JapanTel.:   81-3-5219-45000 (Main)   81-3-5219-45553 (Direct)Fax:   81-3-5219-4510Assistant (Maggy Yamanishi)Tel.:   81-3-5219-45554   Email:   Yo.Yamanishi@enron.com Jeremy.Pitts@BAKERNET.com\t10/20/2000 06:17 PM \t\t\t To: Jane.McBride@enron.com\t\t\t cc: Alan.Aronowitz@enron.com, Mark.Evans@enron.com, Mark.Taylor@enron.com, Paul.TYO.Davis@BakerNet.com\t\t\t Subject: RE: ...

As discussed, your answers to my questions can be quite briefand pls cross   reference previous advice rather than repeating it.   I think the answer to question 1 - whether we can give thewarranty - has   got to be no.   So short and sweet on this is fine.   Re whether we can go ahead without the same &amp;copy;(ii) from them(but with   &amp;copy;(ii))) is a harder question and I understand that all you cando is   explain our risk and exposure, in light of the current factualsituation.   This is a risk appetite question at the end of the day.   Jane   ---"

It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with travelingto the USVI; since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI Iwouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland orPuerto Rico. We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be anexploratory trip for us - not at all a bad thing.   We can't get the boat to theUSVI till Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's tons ofwork getting all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).   Best bet is to pick Bruceup in St. John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a large, busycommercial port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with the cruiseships (not fun).

Basically, I was not able to get hold of a travelpermit. Vermont apparently has lost my documents including travel permit andFederal Plaza cannot step in.   I cannot drive to Vermont, because they onlydo postal.   I think I would feel slightly better had I known theoutcome at the start of the day rather than at the end. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I asked the question of whether Icould goto the US Virgin Islands.   The first answer was \"no\", so Ipersisted and the second answer was \"yes; can I point you to the US in the USVirgin Islands\", so feeling very patronised but having achieved somethingfor my day at Federal Plaza I left. We now have 3 choices: 1.   Go to US VI...I definitely cannot go to BVI 2.   Delay flight a couple of days and hope that travel permitcomes through (which it should because my lawyer) 3.

If not, how is the liability limited and on whose credit would we be relying if we trade?MarkMark Elliott04/06/999 06:02 AMTo: ECT London European Tradingcc:   Subject: APX - Membership ApplicationJust to let you know that last Thursday, we submitted, in the name of Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Limited, an application at very short notice to become one of the first members of the Amsterdam Power Exchange.The Exchange still has many outstanding issues to resolve re its mode of operation and I shall keep you informed of progress.   The Exchange is due to go live, however, at the beginning of May 1999 but our feeling is that there are so many substantial issues remaining to be resolved that either it shall not hit this deadline or, if it does, it will be in a very chaotic state.   However please note that initially it is proposed that the Exchange is simply for day-ahead physical power deals; the Exchange is the counterparty to transactions and there is no separate clearing house.It is proposed that at some future stage a financial futures' market will develop when our SFA-regulated entity will then have to become an Exchange member - but this is some way off. Kind regardsMark \n"

Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today.For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no WHEREAS is a good start.RegardsLouise \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   David Gilberg &lt;gilbergd@sullcrom.com&lt;   25/05/999 000:16 To: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT, lkitchen@enron.co.ukcc: GW125B.NY125333.RAISLERK@gw1.wise.net, GW125B.NY12534.PURVISM@gw1.wise.net (bcc: Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT)Subject: Access and Trading AgreementsAttached are clean and blacklined versions of the Access Agreement and Trading Agreement, which have been revised to reflect Mark's comments and some additional changes we have made.

I will talk to them again tomorrow and suggest that we shut off their capability to trade physical gas online (and vica versa for Aquila Energy Marketing).   They have asked us not to do this however I believe it may be time to revisit this.   We do have the legal ability to hold them to their click deals however they do not have the contracts to manage physical gas. This would obviously make a messy situation.   I suggest that you call Jennifer Denny, Torrey Moorer or myself as soon as you see one of these transactions in the future as we can check into it immediately.   All transactions that have occured will be assigned by Aquila to Aquila.

Aquila can restrict themselves via the administration function should the elect to.   This will mean that Aquila's contract and credit people will need to talk to their commercial people. Debbie Brackett requested collateral on all financial trades done by Aquila Energy Marketing.   This prompted Aquilla's credit to say they would stop trading as such.   Aquilla's traders feel we should provide an alternative solution.   The contractual solution we have proposed will resolve the contractual issues however it does not fix the intraday credit issue.   EOL will not apply the trades to the correct headroom number when doing the credit look prior to the completion of a transaction.We need to evaluate if there is a systematic solution which can afford to give the customer what they want and cover all the credit bases.   The solution would have   the system compare the ID and the product and then allocates the trade to the appropriate company for both contractual and headroom purposes.For now we will continue to assign trades between companies and credit will continue to request collateral as appropriate.Please let me know how you would like to proceed.David Forster12/29/999 03:24 AMTo: Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Aquila Risk/Energy Marketing Profile ChangesBob,Is this the latest on Aquila?Is this still an issue for KN?I note that the Aquila contacts requesting a profile change are Contracts and Credit - have we spoken to the traders? I'm not comfortable that limiting the profiles provides the best solution for the customer - bearing in mind that our primary customer is the trader, who will be the one actively using EOL.I'm also not real happy about restricting a customer's profile - although I realise that we have done so for Power (license issue) and we do so for credit purposes. More importantly, though, we are talking about restricting a customer's profile to make it harder for an actively trading counterparty (valid or not) to be doing trades.To my way of thinking, we need a solution which encourages the traders to trade without annoying other elements in Aquila to the point where they pull access to EnronOnline - which brings me back to the assignment solution, hairy though it may be.Thoughts?Dave---",

We need to check with Robert George on this issue.)Imbedded Capital Contracts---(Scott Porter raised the issue of developing a new form of template with Andrea and asked that we discuss the issue with Robert George.)Distribution Contracts---The commercial group would like to have preapproved distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a commercial bypass.   Only two distributors have had their form approved by the ENARGAS.   We are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution contracts with the LDCs to avoid long delays.ENARGAS Expedientes---ENARGAS has issued an order to Enron to amend three of its gas contracts to modify references to firm transportation and to unbundle the pricing.   The ENARGAS also sent a letter to our customers which we feel overstepped their regulatory role.   The meeting between Roberto Pensoti and Hector Formica was held last Thursday.   Roberto had a follow up phone conversation with Hector on Friday and had a meeting Monday morning with Alicia Federico to get a feel for the amount of resistance we will get. We have been given a 30 day extension to respond to the order in order to have meetings with the ENARGAS and try to come to some resolution on this issue. The first meeting will be scheduled early next week.Neuquen Tax Assessment---Andrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information regarding the stamp tax assessment on the Technical Assistance Agreement between TGS and EPCA to George Frumkin, Anna Sepulveda and Michelle Blaine who will co-ordinate with TGS and Perez Companc on the strategy for responding to the assessment.   Michelle will call TGS outside counsel today in order to hire him to also represent EPCA.   EPCA has filed its response to Neuquen using the arguments prepared by TGS on January 27.   Michelle Blaine has requested information regarding what the next step by Neuquen might possibly be.   We will look into the issue.Tax Lobbying---Jordan Mintz and Terry Thorn are proposing a series of meetings with government officials in late February and have asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can also arrange a meeting with Mr. Lenicov at that time.   Issues include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level.   There is a proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the VAT tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax.   The focus of the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who should be involved in the actual lobbying process.   Jordan Mintz is handing off the responsibility he had assumed on this issue to Jim Ginty.   Jordan has asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can set up a meeting with Mr. Lenicov on March 111th or 12th since Terry Thorn can be in Buenos Aires on those days.Transportation Capacity Release Guidelines---Must review and comment on new ENARGAS proposed guidelines by February 5.   Comments were made on February 5.Vandenfil---Vandenfil has filed for a pre-bankruptcy proceeding which has not yet been \"opened\" by the court due to the January recess.   For the last three months Vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending themtermination notices with a two business day cure period.   The most likelyscenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will be \"continued\" by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing deliveries of gas.   After the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not been served notice that our contract is \"continued\" within 30 days we would be allowed to terminate the contract.   One of the risks that we face with this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate the contract claiming we are providing a public service.Imasa Bid---Format of Enron's original proposal structure changed.   Enron and Albanesi submitted joint termsheet to Central Puerto in November   where Enron proposed signing two contracts with Central Puerto, one for the supply of all the gas transportation and another for the supply for 60 percent of the gas requirements and Albanesi proposed two contracts, one for supplying 40 percent of the supply of the gas and another for the building of the pipeline spur.   Central Puerto is studying the proposals and has not responded as of January 25, 1999.Dow Pipeline Spur Feasibility Study---Enron and Dow are studying the feasibility of building a pipeline between TGS and two affiliates of Dow. Issues include determining whether our CEIASA shareholder and owners agreements preclude Enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory guidelines.   Andrea will be putting together a short report based on her meeting with Nestor Martinez.   A team meeting consisting of legal, regulatory, commercial, credit and structuring met yesterday to discuss the broad parameters of the Dow spur proposal.   The commercial group is preparing a first draft of a build, operate and finance termsheet that they would like to present to the customer on Thursday to be reviewed by Robert George. Credit is still doing its analysis of the two proposed counterparties.Contract Review---Preliminary gas contract reviews for Central Puerto and Ave Fenix for Rob Rice and Federico Cerisoli.Gas Deals:Chauvco---20 day gas supply contract being draftedCerro VanGuardia---Amendment to the gas sale agreement being drafted to cover negotiated changes to the take or pay provisions.Bagley---Two Offer letters sent to two Bagley entities for review, Enron was not the low bidder.   I have been asked by to look into how other \"marketers\" are avoiding the turnover tax and thus be more competitive than we are.   The customer is looking at the relative risks between firm distribution and interruptable distribution but is running up against a deadline for actually requesting a contract template for distribution services.   The contract is slated to begin March 23, however, the distributor has 30 days to respond for requests for distribution services.Total---Spot master agreement proposed for transactions out of Neuquen.   Short term draft offer for gas out of Chubut being reviewed by Total.   A separate one year supply contract template supplied by Total is being reviewed.   The customers template contains the same type of language that gave us Antitrust trouble in the PCR contract.   Peidra Buena---Gas sale agreement for peakinggas.   Final offer sent and Gas has started flowing.   We are now working ona one year contract.   A termsheet has been sent to the customer. Dow---Negotiating offer letter format for sale of gas to two Dow affiliates. Gas deal is related to but independent of the spur issue.   A mark up of draft has been received the end of last week, Dow indicates that further comments are to be sent soon.Power Deals:We need to draft an output marketing form of contract for the purchase of electricity.Argentine Signatories:Scott Neal has approved a new structure for signatories in Argentina.   I will work with Hope Duggan firm on the new POA's.\n"

      "body": "\nThe hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=\rhe=20\rterms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.   I'll=\r=20\rhave to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =\r I=20\ralso have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=\r=20\rtraded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20\rDescriptions:\r Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=\ry=20\rclear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=\rn=20\rthe box at the top of the relevant Annex?   If so, maybe we should add a lin=\re=20\rsomething to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20\rTransaction.'   Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the=\r=20\rrelevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20\rreferring to the quality as well.\r Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?\r The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=\r=20\rthere is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=\r=20\rGTC.   Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes=\r=20\rmore intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa=\rme=20\runits.   If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number=\r=20\rsome counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.=\r =20\rThe GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit=\r. =20\rIt seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20\rvolume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth=\r=20\rUnit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20\r Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20\rbeginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=\r=20\rthe GTC.\r The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.   Can the=20\rparenthetical reference come out?   (The EnronOnline people may care about=\r=20\rthis more than I.)\r If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=\r=20\rwould suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=\r=20\rUnit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=\rt=20\rthe unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=\r=20\rmonth'.\r Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?   This needs to =\rbe=20\rclear from the Long Description.\r   So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=\r=20\rsomething like this:\r A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&amp;EBS=018=\r)=20\rpursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=\ry=20\rof Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.

(Revised)\r The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=\rhe=20\rterms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.   I'll=\r=20\rhave to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =\r I=20\ralso have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=\r=20\rtraded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20\rDescriptions:\r Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=\ry=20\rclear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=\rn=20\rthe box at the top of the relevant Annex?   You are correct. If so, maybe we=\r=20\rshould add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS=\r-3=20\rfor this Transaction.'   Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc=\re=20\rto the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20\rsentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten=\rce=20\rof the long description to read \" A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20\rBroadband Services, L.P. (\"EBS\") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an=\rd=20\rthe Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20\rCounterparty via the Website.\r Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t=\rhe=20\rindustry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the=\r=20\rlong description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20\rincredibly long, complex and technical.   If you feel strongly about it, we=\r=20\rcan include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you=\r=20\rshould include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20\rnecessary.\r The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=\r=20\rthere is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=\r=20\rGTC.   The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G=\rTC=20\r(and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price=\r=20\ris being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component=\r=20\rof the \"Unit Price\" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to=\r=20\rconfuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20\rdescription and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit=\r=20\rPrice was calculated using the price quoted.   Unless industry trading=20\rconvention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the=\r=20\rvolume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.   If the volume is=20\rBandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or=\r=20\rperhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.   The GTC contains the=\r=20\rdefined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.   It seems to me tha=\rt=20\rif we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20\rUnits, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number =\rof=20\rDSO miles for the transaction. =20\r Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20\rbeginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=\r=20\rthe GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig=\rht=20\rto customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20\r(which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi=\rth=20\rus.   This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted=\r=20\rthis fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20\rcosts to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation=\r=20\ragreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process.\r The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.   Can the=20\rparenthetical reference come out?   (The EnronOnline people may care about=\r=20\rthis more than I.) Agreed\r If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=\r=20\rwould suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=\r=20\rUnit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=\rt=20\rthe unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=\r=20\rmonth'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20\rSince the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20\roffered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.   We are also a bit=20\rsensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo=\rng=20\rdescription.   From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20\rlanguage used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate.\r Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?   This needs to =\rbe=20\rclear from the Long Description.   If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3=\r=20\rBandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20\rwould be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.   I hope=\r=20\rthat this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear.\r   So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=\r=20\rsomething like this:\r A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&amp;EBS=018=\r)=20\rpursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=\ry=20\rof Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.

Chris Long (Enron) was there withEllen Levinson of our Washington office.The \"big\" issue discussed was whether to push hard for amendments oncross-affiliate netting.   The consensus was that while everyone in the room(and all of Wall Street was there,as well as ISDA and commodities groups)wants the amendments, they are considered controversial by the President'sWorking Group and could derail progress on the version of bankruptcy reformcurrently before Congress which everyone also agrees is very goodlegislation for financial markets participants.   On the basis that gettingthe current bill enacted quickly is of paramount importance, theAssociation determined to \"back pocket\" the cross-affiliate netting issue,meaning that if the current legislation moves quickly, the Association willnot raise the issue but if the legislation gets bogged down in committeeand other nontechnical changes are being proposed, the Association will usethat opportunity to add cross-affiliate netting provisions.Feel free to call if you have any questions.___Rick B.

I don't believe it would be consistent with Enron Corp's policy to have a lawyer working for the business developer. ECT Legal and EI Legal need to get together to decide who Brent should be reporting to, but I can assure you it should not be me.   This is a seperate issue from who is covering Brent's costs.   I do believe he is under the Argentine office's cost center since he is dedicating 1000% of his time here.   This is consistent with EISC's policy of allocating legal costs out to the business unit that is incurring the cost.

The online \"making of a market\" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time prices for both purchases and sales of commodities2.   The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity derivative transaction.3.   The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation of the \"Stack Manager\" which automates this process in many ways so that the system can react more quickly than a person.4.   EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line \"short description\" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty.5.   The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the counterparty profile containing both credit information and information concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place.6.   It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application)7.   The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading authority of various password holders.8.   Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in which he or she is interested.9.   The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.Mark Taylor \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Mark E Haedicke   04/18/2000 04:52 PM To: Travis McCullough/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sborgman@velaw.com, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Business Methods on Paper.comBased on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business methods that may be novel from a patent point of view:1.   our site is offering \"prime\" paper rather than seconds or ends2.   credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost to customers3.   customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk on physical paper products4.   customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on prime offeringsPlease give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.Mark Haedicke\n"

Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the process - possibly mid September.\tMark E Haedicke@ECT\t08/111/2000 09:30 AM \t\t\t To: Chris Long/Corp/Enron@ENRON\t\t\t cc: Allison Navin/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRON, raislerk@sullcrom.com, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EEES@EES@ENRON, Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES@ENRON, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t Subject: Re: CFTC ReauthorizationDo you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong opposition of the CFTC?

As you are all aware, all financial confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm desk in Calgary.   However, it seems that there has been some confusion relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for Canadian physical confirms.   That is, as is currently the process for physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation letters, with no involvement of the legal department.   However, for any financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms (as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.   Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark Powell.   Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, approve and have executed.   The executed confirm will then be returned to either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the counterparty.   Again, this will only be required for transactions which are out of the ordinary.With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have responsibility for such matters.   Therefore, to the extent that we need to put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in Houston.Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our legal group to deal with these matters.   As well, we will need to ensure that Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact me.   Otherwise, I think we should implement these procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp winter days in Calgary.ThanksGreg\n"

      "body": "\nGreg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.   My only comments would be (i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual matter.   I agree about Tana.Mark\tGreg Johnston\t111/06/2000 02:34 PM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation ProcessMark, as discussed here is a draft of my proposed e-mail for your review.

David confirmed that while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor is located would govern perfection.   Because of this uncertainty and because of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral?Peter, As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash as collateral.   In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such cash.   I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such cash proceeds are property of the estate.Let me know what you think.

(\"Enron Canada\") is in the process of negotiating a Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement (the \"Master\") with BC Gas Utility Ltd. (\"BC Gas\").   In this regard, we have recently received a request from BC Gas to amend the \"applicable law\" of the Master from Alberta to British Columbia such that subsection 17.12 of the Master would read as follows:\"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed, enforced, and performed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia, without regard to principles of conflicts of law, and each Party hereby submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of British Columbia.\"   BC Gas has also asked that the applicable law for the guarantee of Enron Corp. be governed by the laws of British Columbia.While I am fairly sure that we will be able to persuade BC Gas to accept the State of Texas as the appropriate law for the Enron Corp. guarantee, it seems unlikely (because the counterparty is a British Columbia utility that operates primarily in British Columbia) that BC Gas will accept any jurisdiction other than British Columbia with respect to the Master.Although I have not been called to the bar in British Columbia and there may be some quirks and minor differences between the jurisdictions, it is my understanding that the commercial law of British Columbia is generally not much different from that of Alberta.   Nevertheless, I am seeking your comments and consent to such an amendment to the Master.Should you have any questions or require additional information, please give me a call at (403) 974-6708.   Thank you for your assistance with this matter.Yours truly,Mark Powell\n"

      "body": "\nSorry for the delay in getting back to you.   I never did come up with a good solution last year to the \"cat climbing the Christmas tree\" problem except fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the tree they didn't shake off.   This year she seems content to just hide underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just gotten too big.   I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about double-sided tape?   I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the tree).   And of course, the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden and metal ornaments - nothing breakable.   \"Peter Knop\" &lt;Foundation@Ticonderoga.com&lt; on 10/17/999 02:42:111 PMTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Christmas Trees and catsChristmas is coming again, and in reviewing our mail, I came across your\"problem\".   Did you come up with any solution??? A friend of ours (non-catowner) suggested putting mouse traps under the tree - a couple of paw snapsand maybe no more???   Sounded cruel to me, especially for my oldest cat (13years).   We have used pepper in some cases in the garden, but in the house, thiswould probably be more damaging to the humans than our 4 footed friends :-)   If you have had any luck last year, please let us know, and we can postit on our web page which we are revising.   Others would find it interestingand perhaps amusing as well.

        " Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT on 10/19/2000 10:26 AM ---Ron Nolte10/16/2000 12:37 PMTo: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Torrey Moorer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Johnson/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: City StreetsJust came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey Moorer informed everyone about the new venture between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered on EOL.I solicit comments from everyone.As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto HoustonStreet.Com and   deals offered on EOL will magically appear. The party might think, \"Hey, I can't do better than this on EOL, I'll take this deal\".   The deal is transacted   and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.   As soon as the \"Do the Deal\"   button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL whereit is validated.   An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.In the case of a gas deal,   the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and TAGG.   The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:   HoustonStreet.Com Deal #   EOL Deal #   Sitara Deal #   TAGG Deal #Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.   If you are in TAGG,   you should be able to access the deal usingHoustonStreet.Com   Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.If you are in DCAF II,   you should be able to access the deal using HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I assume ) will need to be changed to capture boththe HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.   The TAGG Deal number itself   is assigned by the Capture program.This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was assumed that there is only one \"Originating System\")   program modifications to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,   DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( clears Power deals ).Now for some issues:1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the confirmation?   Whichever Enron entity   offers that product on EnronOnline will be the party for these trades as well.   Will a HoustonStreet.Com and a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?   There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information is set up based on who the external party is doing business with. In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information set up for these same external   parties that do trades on EOL will have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com logo? No.   The confirms may reference the platform on which the trade was done but otherwise it should look just like a regular Enron confirmation.3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?   Same process as exists for EnronOnline transactions.4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under EOL.   But who are the contracts between?   If new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, then contracts will have to be set up between the new internal parties.   But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes through EOL, how will the appropriate contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, is   a different contract assigned   in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself? Seems to me it should be the same - we only have one agreement with Koch. \n"

Todd, could you check with the EOL folks (Dale Neuner/Frank Davis) to determine the answer, and revert back so we can make a final decision for CL.

Tom, have any decisions been made with respect to that issue?\tThomas D Gros@ENRON\t09/08/2000 02:28 PM \t\t\t To: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: CommodityLogic Legal DocsHi guys,Louise was concerned that CommodityLogic might not have borrowed the latest edition of EOL documents for use on the CommodityLogic website.   Could I please ask you two to ensure that we are using the latest legal stuff.   I am not sure who actually holds the definitive copy of the latest EOL legal docs...Thanks very much,Tom\n"

Is there an English language version of your presentation available?MarkMartin Rosell12/15/98 07:41 AMTo: ECT London European Tradingcc:   Subject: Commodity Derivatives Committee (Norway)Earlier today, Thor Lien and I held a 1.5 hours presentation for the ten members of the above Committee.   The Committee has been assigned the task of examining issues related to commodity derivatives trading in Norway and to propose a concrete regulatory framework (currently financial commodity trading is not regulated in Norway) on 15 June next year at the latest.   The background knowledge of the Committee members, representing different Norwegian interests, appeared to be quite shifting; while certain Committee members had in-depth knowledge of, for instance, EU capital requirements others revealed limited understanding of the functioning of the power markets.   The Committee took a great interest in the two regulatory points that I brought up, the lack of recognition of close-out netting in Norway and the forthcoming implications of CAD2.   The discussions sometimes were vivid, but I believe that we succeeded in getting most of our message through.   The vice-chairman of the Committee (lawyer) invited us to render further comments in writing and said that he would return to us for further discussions when the drafting process was about to start next year.Martin\n"

No Enron employee is permitted to trade any commodity for their own account (or for the account of another) which Enron trades.   The only general exceptions to this are for equity and debt securities - and there are special restrictions on persons who trade those items for Enron.   This policy is modified from time to time by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors and is monitored by the Risk Assessment and Control Group.   I believe Cassandra Schultz currently has that responsibility.   I am sending her a copy of this e-mail (so in case I have misrepresented the policy in some way, Cassandra please correct me) and if you need any further information, please contact her.Mark\tVikas Dwivedi@ENRON\t02/20/20001 04:08 PM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Commodity Trading AccountMark,I am interested in opening a personal commodity trading account.

      "body": "\nApparently there was some miscommunication.   It was very clear to me after our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were going to add the consent to the notice letter.   It was that consent that was to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities could be listed.   As we discussed last week, without that consent each proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.   Neither of these evaluations will be easy or quick.   While Enron North America has been reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.   We have not yet determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to make important judgment calls.My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them as a Reference Entity.We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the evaluations mentioned above.   Please send the list of proposed Reference Entities as soon as possible.Bryan Seyfried01/19/2000 06:35 AMTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: ConsentJust to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions and why it is good for them.   My hope is that there are very few reference credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.   As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we have a potential fiduciary responsibility.   The latter obviously will not be black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.   I would expect that are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies for the miscommunication.Call me if you want to discuss further.bs\n"

In short, he wants to be behind one and apparently John Sherriff is comfortable with this.   I have therefore asked Ken Raisler to advise us on how to construct a Chinese Wall from a practicle, US perspective, with the intention of having Sanjev at Slaughters modify the \"instruction kit\", as necessary, to work under English law.   Given Ken's involvement on equity trading, he appears to be the right place to start.   There remains the possibility that when the traders see the procedures they will change their minds and wish to stick with the existing procedures you have seen.This will not impact launch of credit trading online which, as advised, is still set for tomorrow.Please let me have any thoughts on this.RegardsPaul\n"

If you are still trying to decide about shore excursions, I was just remembering my trip and have the following observations:I found the volcano on the Big Island to be marginally interesting, not particularly pretty, and from where I was staying (Kona), a very long day.Kauai was very beautiful - the Na Pali coast is particularly spectacular (that coast and the nearby beaches are where South Pacific was filmed) but it is quite rugged and nearly inaccessible as I remember it except on foot or by boat.   I would highly recommend seeing it by boat if that option is available, otherwise, you can just drive up to the end of the road and get a pretty good view.   There is also a river boat trip I didn't get to take so I can't recommend it - it was popular with visitors.I didn't make it to Maui but I've always thought it would be fun to go to the top of the mountain to watch the sunrise (in a car or bus) and then ride down the hill on a bicycle.   There was a bay near Honolulu on Oahu (near Diamond Head) where I did my first-ever snorkeling.   It was very popular (crowded) but a lot of fun and while there were plenty of fish to see the reef itself was pretty dead (not a lot of pretty coral).I found the web site for the dolphin lab where I worked but a quick look didn't indicate they have a visitors center.   You might call them when you are there if you have the extra time and want to go.   http:///dolphin-institute.org/As far as your clothes are concerned, since you won't have to carry them yourselves, why not   take them all!Have a great trip!Love, Mark\n"

They discuss generally what ECT can offer and if the customer wants to do a deal they are told to contact Hector Ramirez in Houston who actually does the trade directly with the customer.   Neither EI Argentina nor any employee from this office should be mentioned in any document going to the customer since we are not technically involved in the trade.   As a relationship issue our people here are anxious to make sure the documentation and confirmation of trades goes smoothly.   There may be a finders fee paid by ECT to EI for customers directed to ECT depending on various factors which I am not privy to.   I hope this helps.If you find a decent tickler program let me know.To: Brent Hendry/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT @ ECTcc:   Subject: DAPSAI have resolved the Consent to Service of Process with CT Corporation and Mr. Blaquier and am going to send Mr. Blaquier the originals tonight for execution.   I don't know how to handle the check, he suggested dropping it off at your office.   I think I'm just going to have him include it back in the package to me and then send it on to CT along with their form.   CT will then issue a letter to DAPSA reflecting their acceptance of their role.   We need to get a copy of the letter that Mr. Blaquier receives, and then we're covered.This will be renewed on an annual basis, with CT directly sending the bill to DAPSA.   If they do not receive a renewal check within a month they will cancel their agency relationship.   So, somehow, we need to followup on this on an annual basis.   Unfortunately, we do not have a tickler system to remind us annually to do something.   I'm going to talk to Mary Solomson, they have a tickler in Global Contracts and I'm going to see if we can get it added to it.   I can see this falling through the cracks.   Any suggestions?One other thing, at the Legal/Credit meeting we discussed the DAPSA agreement and I was quizzed as to who the business people were and they only ones I know of are in Argentina, and won't that cause ECT to have a presence in Argentina if we transact the trades down there?   How is that going to work?   Are the trades going to be entered into from Houston?   Can you let me know so I can report back.Much thanks!\n"

Please return your approved language asap.ThanksJohn A. PeytonDear Mark Mey,We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products.   For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction in which Enron North America would purchase a Financial Call Option (\"Cap\") from Noble Drilling Corporation for the Calculation Period   April 1, 20001 through June 30, 20001 for one Rig.   The Strike Price would be $65,000 per (Rig*Day) and the premium which we would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation (within Five Business Days of the Trade Date) would be US Dollars $2000,000.The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and low Rig Day Rates for JU-3000'-IC as published by Offshore Data Services, Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable Calculation Period, on the page entitled \"Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and Day Rates\".   The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.We have authority to enter into the above this type of transaction and would be able to move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract.   Because the market for dayrates is highly volatile [and because we may have made similar proposals to other counterparties] (is this true?), this indicative proposal is only good until August 31st, 2000.   We look forward to further discussions. This document contains indicative terms only and is not intended to create a binding or enforceable contract nor is it an offer or commitment to enter into any transaction.   All terms are subject to change until agreement as to a specific transaction has been reached.   ENA is not acting as a fiduciary or advisor and you should evaluate and understand the terms, conditions, and risks of all transactions in making your decisions with respect thereto.   The proposal described herein is subject to further review and approval by ENA and Counterparty and, among other matters, further review and approval of the board of directors of each party, and the negotiations, execution and delivery of definitive agreements containing all appropriate provisions, including those related to credit, limitations of damages and others.Sincerely,John A.

It's quickly becoming one of the world's largest tradedcommodities, yet it's one of the last to be bought and sold over theInternet. But that's about to change today when Houston Street Exchangeintroduces HoustonStreet.com, a new online electric power trading floor thatallows power traders to buy and sell electricity faster and better thanbefore.Houston Street Exchange hopes to do for the power industry what Erade did for the stock market: turn the industry upside down by bringingtogether buyers and sellers in a real-time, efficient online format. Thiswill shift the control of the $70 billion wholesale power market in theUnited States by putting it directly into the hands of power marketers,utilities and other traders that are entering the increasingly deregulatedenergy market. HoustonStreet.com serves as a portal for power traders,providing critical information regarding weather, energy news, stocks andother direct links necessary for trading electricity. HoustonStreet.com ispioneering the emerging business-to-business e-commerce power tradingmarket.Lights out for phones, static Web sitesHoustonStreet.com delivers what has so far been elusive to the power trader:an easy-to-use, fully Web-based trading floor that gives power traders allthe information and flexibility they need to post offers, make bids, counterand re-counter instantaneously, until they close the deal.Historically, power marketers have attempted to finalize deals whilejuggling numerous phones and praying no one is undercutting theirtransactions because they can't see a real-time picture of market pricing.They lose precious time because they must call around to get the latestmarket prices.   HoustonStreet.com eliminates that by giving power tradersinstant access to current pricing fluctuations in different regional powermarkets.\"The real-time environment of the Web naturally lends itself to tradingwholesale power,\" said Paul Messerschmidt, manager of Power Markets Servicesat Energy Security Analysis, Inc. \"But existing online products areinflexible and they typically require proprietary hardware or software tooperate.   Until these issues are rectified, wholesale power trading onlinewill remain dormant. Houston Street Exchange is positioning itself as theindustry's wake-up call by providing a secure, reliable and flexibleplatform that allows traders to trade power the same way they do today, butmore efficiently.\"HoustonStreet.com enables traders to make deals based on the product andterm of their choice, providing them the flexibility to buy and sell thesame way they do now, only utilizing a much more efficient and easy-to-usemedium-the Internet.\"The leadership of Houston Street Exchange has a vision for changing thepower marketing industry\" said Alan Herrick, senior vice president atSapient Corporation (NASDAQ: SAPE) the e-services consultancy that helpedcreate HoustonStreet.com. \"They understand the importance of first-moveradvantage and the need to continually provide a world-class experience fortheir targeted market.   Sapient is delighted to be Houston Street'spartner.\"Built with power traders in mindDesigned by power traders for power traders, HoustonStreet.com enables usersto maintain total control over each transaction, view their complete tradinghistory, sort offers and bids by price, term, volume and delivery point, andtrade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year using an online service that ensuresthe security and anonymity of each transaction.Easy to access, navigate and use, HoustonStreet.com gives tradersup-to-the-second market information, allowing them to make the best deals atthe right time without having to leave the site.   Traders are able tocustomize their Web page so they can see information that may impactdecisions on trading strategy such as updated weather reports, newsheadlines about the energy industry and stock prices.HoustonStreet.com provides users with the ability to enter their owninformation regarding trading agreements and credit status without betrayingthe anonymity of other parties. Knowing whether an enabling agreement is inplace and credit issues have been resolved beforehand gives a power marketera tremendous advantage in making split-second decisions.Because of its ease of use and real-time environment, HoustonStreet.com willallow power traders to make more transactions and become more efficient.HoustonStreet.com will initially cover the Northeast regions (NEPOOL, PJM,NY) and expects to roll out the remaining trading regions of the countryover the next several months.\"Wholesale power trading in the United States has grown by about 9000 percentsince 19996. In 19998, more than 3.0 billion megawatt hours were traded, withvirtually all of it done over the telephone,\" said Frank Getman, HoustonStreet Exchange's president and CEO. \"We are redefining how power is tradedin the wholesale market, making it much more efficient and easy for powermarketers to buy and sell electricity. HoustonStreet.com represents apowerful convergence of two major trends: growth of business-to-businesse-commerce and deregulation of the electric power industry.\"About SapientSapient Corporation is an innovative e-services consultancy.

What should the consistent market convention for determining the first tranaction be?   If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the premium swap as the \"first transaction\"   and the discount as the second.   This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.   Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.   I will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.   The product description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily be able to determine the correct direction to trade.   I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get back to you .Thanks Pete\n"

Besides further streamlining and refining of the doc, I've also styled it somewhat differently why it, on the face of the mark-ups, may appear even more amended than is the case. I've chosen to call the doc. 'Nordic Power Master Agreement' and inserted the Norwegian name of the Nordic Power Traders Association (\"NPTA\") in the header (hopefully, NPTA will be prepared to launch and market the doc. in its own name).   I've also prepared a brief Schedule addressing the optionality offered by the document.   The document is originally based upon ECT's Industrial Master Agreement.   In the Industrial Agreement, terms such as \"the Contract\", \"this Contract\", \"this Agreement\" and \"the Agreement\" are used interchangeably and not always with great preciseness.   In the attached document the terms \"this Master Agreement\" or \"this Agreement\" are used consistently (the latter to include all Transactions).   These are my remarks to the (principal) changes made, and to some issues that the new doc gives rise to:1.   Transactions.   I've introduced some ISDA wordings herein (for example, the \"Inconsistency\" provisions) and deleted text that I find less appropriate or necessary in the current context.2.   ObligationsThis is a critical Section since it also refers to products for which there currently are no NPTA documentation (\"Options\" and \"Collars\").   When I discussed this with the Nordic trading desk it sounded less thrilled about us expanding the current Nordic bilateral power contracts range, and I have therefore left references to options (other than swaptions and Asian options) within square brackets (including related definitions).   (Supposedly, this will be something for the Working Group, Reference Group and the NPTA to determine.)   I've expanded the text on SWAPs and included a brief reference to ASIAN (options) and also streamlined the Tax clause. 3.   RepresentationReps are not particularly common in Nordic law contracts.   The \"No Reliance\" reps appear to be typically American and may not be to everyone's taste.   Since parties seldom are prepared to give \"Payee\" reps I've cut out that part and also taken out the \"Payer\" reps as something that we should be able to do without.   I also feel a bit hesitant towards S&amp;M's proposed \"Changes in Representation\" and therefore rubbed that one out as well (whilst being at it).4.   Market DisruptionSince the underlying reference price (Nord Pool's spot price) is quoted on an hourly basis, some wordings have been included to reflect that.5.   Events of DefaultI'm mostly concerned about the cross-default clause.   Insofar as ECTRIC (and its possible Credit Support Provider) is concerned, we may, in this particular context, lose more than we gain from a cross default provision.   Also, the cross default   also only appears to apply to \"borrowed money\" (and \"such obligation\") and not default under any other \"specified transactions\".   It's worth considering making cross default optional and part of the Schedule instead.6.   RemediesAs the enforceability of close-out netting in certain jurisdictions may require the automatic termination of all Transactions, it's   necessary to offer the parties the choice of \"Automatic Early Termination\" in the Schedule.7.   Events of ChangeI've followed the route of the Nordic 'Amendment Agreement' and pulled together \"Events of   Change\" and \"Change in Tax Law\" and done my best to streamline this sections since it undoubtedly will raise questions from local players in due course.(The former sections 8 (Credit Support), 9 (Set-off) and 10 (Confidentiality) have been edited out.   The former because of the streamlining of the credit provisions (and related definitions) and the two latter since those concern issues that rather should be addressed by the parties bilaterally.)8.   Governing Law and JurisdictionAs previously discussed, this part is something for the parties to agree upon in the Schedule.9.   DocumentsAs above under 8.10.   MiscellaneousI've crossed out the former \"Currency Provisions\" since it won't be enforceable in certain jurisdictions.   (Might be something for the Schedule.)111.   DefinitionsSome of the credit terms have been stricken out.   With reference to my earlier comment with respect to the uncertainty relating to the inclusion into the document of further options instruments, the related terms defined are in between square brackets.   Some of the defined terms may need to be further refined to better reflect the products, trading routines and settlement mechanisms in the Nordic Electricity market.Exhibit A The relevant details can be found in the Schedule.---Please return with any comments you may have before close of business on Thursday (Oslo time).Martin\n"

There are a large number of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever an Enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and negotiating from here.   To the extent you are interested in using ISDA Master Agreements, we will be happy to continue in the same way.   I'm not sure they will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements I suspect you need.   If you need the printed form of the ISDA Master that the schedule relates to, let me know and I can have it faxed to you.When the transaction is physical, even if there is an embedded swap or option of some kind, we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from commodity to commodity.   I will ask Elizabeth Sager to send you some sample electricity forms and Jeff Hodge or Dan Hyvl to send some natural gas forms.   In a trading context, since Enron may be on either side of one or more transactions with the same counterparty, the forms are drafted in a bilateral fashion (basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give).   If your situation is different (e.g. our transactions with one party involve only the purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity, dramatic changes to these forms might be in order.With regard to loan/finance transactions, I am not at all familiar with forms they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent that they don't even use forms as such.   I will ask Julia Murray to contact you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk about those types of transactions.   Unfortunately, I don't know of an electronic table of contents to the forms.

Many of the risks that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were close to meaningless.If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii) the widespread use of multiple \"Omnibus\" short-form contracts for trades before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).   Item (i) could be fixed with legislation (as it has in New York).   Item (ii) could be reduced if the traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign master agreements.I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side in the contract negotiation/formation process.   That buy-in needs to be at all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from the top.Mark T.\n"

As a result, ASIC is not able to simply\"transfer-across\" its approval of EAF under the electricity declarationwithout separate consideration as to how EAF can meet the prudentialregulation criteria specified in PS 70.They have asked for further information in this regard.   Obviously Imentioned the presence of the Enron Corp guarantee. However, ASIC mayrequire something further, such as evidence of procedures in place toprevent an Enron failure.   PS 70 states in this regard (in paragraphs 46 and47): \"The ASC considers that providers of safe harbour market facilitiesshould be subject to regulation which at least sets minimum capitalstandards and ensures regular reporting against them. This is because thefinancial stability of a facility provider is a crucial factor in thestability of any market conducted by that provider. This will ensure thatrisks associated with the conduct of a safe harbour market are monitored.Standard setting and monitoring will contribute to the continued financialstability of the facility provider. If the facility provider is asignificant participant in other markets, it will also help prevent anyadverse consequences for those markets if the facility provider fails. Regulatory supervision of this kind may occur in a number of ways.For the purposes of the ASC's policy, it is not the identity of a particular supervisory authority that is important, but the factthat the organisation is subject to supervision which produces the resultsmentioned in para 46. Regulatory supervision will meet this test only if thecapital standards which it imposes on an organisation take into account theorganisation's derivatives market activities.\"The following paragraphs are also explanatory, particularly as they refer tocertain US licensees.   Are any Enron entities subject to prudential orsimilar regulation due to the licences/authorisations which they hold? Thiscould be a useful starting point.They also mentioned that there may be difficulty in achieving the 23 Junetimetable.   However, the focus of the discussion was the policy issue ratherthan timing.Best regardsScott FarrellSenior AssociateMallesons Stephen Jaques SydneyDirect line (61 2) 9296 2142Fax (61 2) 9296 3999\n"

That meeting revealed that a lot of work still needed to be done on the confirms.   Of course, there still hasn't been time to finish the liquids products EOL confirm templates, and I think the priority got less urgent, since these products will be among the last to be traded by EOL.   But the quesiton lingers about the need to attach GTCs to each confirm that's sent out to the EOL counterparty.   It seemed to us that perhaps you and Mark Taylor and others might have had discussions on that topic ahnd reached some conclusion.   Rob Cass made a rather cogent appeal that we not require the attachment (lots of manhours, for one reason, since the computer will not automatically generate the GTCs or autofax them).   But we never had a chance to talk about this, so I'm wondering if you could give me your thoughts.

Mark seems to think that this methodology is rather difficult, and the liklihood of it being accomplished anytime soon is LOW.There is a report that will be generated with each days trading that will identify who our Active customers are (meaning a User ID and Password has been issued). That report will give us that day's exposure; exposure meaning there was activity for that customer, for that day; no exposure meaning there was no activity for that customer, for that day. With activity we would know that an ETA had been signed, and then you could go in and see that the GTC had been signed off (should be simple, as the GTC would match the Product Type being traded). This report would identify new customers as they traded, but would not identify those customers that sign an ETA and do not do any trades.Mark has agreed that our idea is certainly do-able for Phase 2.Dale3-9746\n"

Basically I don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.   My other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't think the Buyer Payment language works   -   can you give me a call so we can discuss my concerns?\n"

It seems to me that the position Justin Boyd outlined is the one that will need to be followed in the US for physical trades.   The Trading Partner Agreement which a party will agree to on-line specifically states that if a master exists between the parties, then that master will govern any on-line transactions.   For those parties who have masters that have been deemed insufficient, something will have to be done to override the Trading Partner Agreement.   That is what Justin is suggesting-a procedure to override unacceptable masters.If that does not answer your questions, please give me a call.

If the terms of a Master are unacceptable to us for whatever reason (e.g. due to insufficient credit provisions), then it may be appropriate to terminate that Master.   If however, we wish to keep a Master in place but do not wish to use it for on-line trades, then the counterparty needs to be notified of this and give its consent.

If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is continuing on any Trading Day, the Floating Price for such Trading Day shall be determined pursuant to the Floating Price Source specified in this Transaction for the first Trading Day thereafter on which no Market Disruption Event exists; provided, however, if the Floating Price is not so determined within three Business Days after the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined by reference to the Alternative Floating Price Source specified in this Transaction, if any, which is not subject to a Market Disruption Event.

These market disruption provisions provide the mechanism for determining the index price if the referenced price is unavailable or there is a material change in the formula or calculation of the referenced price, etc.   I am just waiting to confirm with Mark Taylor that the on-line form of GTC applicable to financial transactions is the same as for the form used for transactions not entered into through EOL.ThanksGreg---"

However, there are some countries with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those issues with specific PA provisions for those countries. 2. No.   Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that only the first time they trade that product.   The GTC's are arranged by \"Product Type\" so you only have to agree to it once for that type - regardless of how many products there are - so for example you only agree to the financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of swaps and options you subsequently trade.3. No.   But if that would be helpful it can be arranged.4.   This one doesn't make much sense to me.   EnronOnline itself doesn't make any money.   There is no advertizing, and EnronOnline doesn't trade - the trades are all done by the various Enron trading entities.   EnronOnline is actually providing them a service.5.

They posed the following questions that I did not know the answer to.   Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible?1.   They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section (2) of the password application that prohibits the user form using the password outside their country.   I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but was not sure.2.   They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC each time they transact a trade.   I believe each product is represented by a separate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought several related products will probably have identical GTCs.   I told them I thought that for each product that you only had to select it once, but that for each product, even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have reviewed, you must accept the GTC again.   Is this correct?3.   Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for use of the system?4.   They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc. for each product could be considered \"content\" for EOL and be considered value for which EOL should pay the trading entities.   I haven't heard of this issue before but I said I would ask.5.   As a proof issue, what would be the process of proving and electronic trade?   How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the data.   How would the data be presented to a court?   6.   How long are the electronic trades retained in our systems and how are they retained?Any help you can give me would be appreciated. Thanks,Brent\n"

This doesn't really make sense to me:   if it is Enron's use then that's our problem and I don't see Eastern's concern and if it is Eastern's use that should be their problem, not ours - how will we know what arrangements they have in place with third parties?   No one else has raised this issue - is this something that is particularly of concern in the UK?they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their learning of the same. When they notify us is not an issue - as long as they understand that they will be liable for anything that happens with their passwords - whether authorized or not.they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time   What is there in the PA that would prevent them from telling us about changed information?ETAThey do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron (see 1(ii)))   This language refers to a variety of language on the site - including things like the submission screen, the Mater User's abilities to restrict sub-user id's, the long descriptions, etc.   It is simply not possible to create a list of every single item on the website that controls how the site is used and contracts are created.   This is one they will just have to live with.   They have to give their traders the credit to read what they are doing and if they don't like it they can stop trading.   They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see last sentence of 2(b)))   I think 2(b) already limits our use of the information to \"Enron\" which is defined pretty much as Enron and its affiliates.   Are they asking for more than that?   You can point them to section 5 which severely limits what we can do with confidential information. They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal EOL is not set up to allow one entity to trade on behalf of another.   How would we ever know who our counterparty really was?   If they want to trade for several counterparties, they need to fill out a separate PA (and separately click on the ETA) for each legal entity.   They should subsequently restrict the sub-user id's for each of those entities to trade only the products appropriate to that entity.To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e)))   We have agreed that we will continue to furnish confirmations where we have a master agreement in place that calls for us to send confirms.   I've had a number of counterparties ask for this and have explained that even when there is not a master in place, in most cases we intend to continue to send confirms.   In fact, it is our intention (and the instructions you and I have received from Louise in no uncertain terms) that the trading should look as close as possible to its current form.   That includes contractual terms and the sending of confirms.   Having said all that, the commercial people look forward with fondness to a time when confirms will become electronic and therefore this language was put in the ETA.   I would be surprised if, should we ever reach such a time, we would refuse to send confirms to those counterparties stuck in the dark ages of \"blue ink on dead trees.\"   Given the frequency with which this on comes up, I wonder if future versions of the ETA should omit the offending language.They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful default/negligence/omission.   This strikes me as a non-starter.   The best we can do is to exclude damage we suffer by reason of our own gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct.   If they want to be without risk, they can continue to use the phone.They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a))), and wish that electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e))).   They can stop trading at any time and do not need to terminate the agreement.   We have agreed on rare occasions that we will deactivate their password if we receive written notice from them requesting deactivation.   I have suggested that they might feel more comfortable giving the Mater User ID and password to someone in their control group so that they don't have to worry about the trader leaving and taking the important password along.   The Master User can always turn off a sub-user immediately.   I'm uncomfortable with the delivery issue since I usually don't get \"notice from the system of delivery\" when I send an e-mail.   Even if return receipts were always used, I don't know that they always work and I wouldn't want the counterparty to be able to prevent our giving notice simply by refusing to open our e-mails.   Certainly no one would successfully assert that an e-mail notice was effective unless properly addressed.   On the other hand, to be practical, if the issue is critical, we will not be relying on an e-mail notification in any event and I can understand their concern that someone might be on holiday when the e-mail is received - not as big an issue with a fax or letter that can be easily opened by someone else.Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points.   Please let me know what you think - thanksIn some cases you just have to wait these guys out.   I know the traders are anxious to get people online and trading, but remember that the same is true on the other side.   Luckily for us, Louise is willing to back us up on this and tell our counterparties to just sit back and watch the rest of the world get the good prices if they don't like our agreements.   In several cases, counterparties who have called with difficult legal departments like this ultimately just went ahead and clicked on the thing to start trading.Justin\n"

Of immediate concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next week. Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments. These are in the annexes to the advice. Following are my commentsPassword Agreement   - Fine, seems a good to give address for notices etc.ETA - I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under Australian law. The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a near opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3&amp;copy; I believe we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality.GTCs - Minor changes. The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to the   collateral clause. Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs for different counterpartiesAs a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the ETA for inclusion in Road Show. I expect to settle the advice early week   and will circulate it.   ---"

One of the attributes of the Phase 2 launch is the development of individual Commodity/Country Home Pages.   The objective of the individual home pages is to allow each commodity group create its own web site (within EnronOnline) and to deliver a more personalized experience for the customers.   A significant aspect of the home pages is the addition of content which will be developed at a desk and or company level.   The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and require constant changes.In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current interesting content on the web site.   In addition we will need to make sure that we include the neccessary disclaimers to avoid other issues.To date we have started to accumulate a significant amount of content (written, audio, PowerPoints and video) which is scheduled to be included in the Phase 2 launch.   We will need to sign off on this content within the next couple of weeks.I have asked Lorraine Becker by copy of this note to arrange a meeting to develop a process of content approval.\n"

You could argue that it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.   The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day convention.This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives   -   should we apply a different interest rate to non-US$ payments?It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives trading agreements be subject to arbitration.   We rarely submit to the jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the US.   Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we decided not to include one here for a particular reason?Again. sorry for the delay.   I will be here all week and happy to discuss any of these points.MarkEdmund Cooper02/15/2000 10:29 AMTo: \"Brown, Gavin\" &lt;Gavin.Brown@SlaughterandMay.com&lt;cc: Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT, Sanjevwks@SlaughterandMay.com, Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Credit Product Documentation   Dear Gavin,Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.   I have marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small tidy-up changes as well.I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references to \"the United States\" in Section 111(B) should remain as references to \"the United Kingdom\" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.   Please let me know if this is unclear.Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local counsel.Many thanks,Edmund.\n"

Mario mentioned that there is still some debate as to whether the contracts should be under Japanese or US law etc... This was something that they were debating about 3 weeks ago.My understanding was that international contracts would be used. These are contracts that trading houses and investment banks would already be familiar with. Could you clarify the exact nature of the hold-up and get a date by which they will finalise this issue. The name of the legal guy is Mark Taylor. I'd like to contact him directly some time to make sure everything is progressing as planned (after all, if we don't have the contracts ready, noone can trade)* Help deskIt is not a good idea to totally rely on the Houston help desk for EOL (especially during Japanese business hours). It took them about 4 minutes to get a translator. Using the translator was time consuming (also remember, international call), the translator was quite rude...and, in any case, I agree that there should be some support on the ground (demonstrate Enron commitment to Japan)Please feel free to give me a call. I'm at the Okura on +81 3 3582 0111To: Joseph P Hirl/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Rousseau Anai/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: EnronOnline - JapanJoe,After extensive probing I discovered that the marketing materials EOL has planned cannot be delivered in time for our plans.   I can think of a number of alternatives for addressing this problem, including: changing brochures to one that can be more easily produced, changing printing firms and/or locations, and delaying the launch date until the following week.   At least one person at EOL suggested that we have a \"press conference\" on May 10 and then send out the materials.   I do not think this is an acceptable approach because it wastes the opportunities from the Nikkei interview on April 10, the higher profile McDonald/Hirl interviews during last week of April and buzz from counterparties receiving the packet.There appears to be a pervasive misunderstanding of our strategy and timelines.   To correct this, I have asked for a meeting with all of the interested parties (except Louise) on Monday afternoon.   We WILL walk through every step of the marketing plan and ensure that we have buy-in and accountable parties for the parts of the process that are outside of the control of Enron Japan.   After the meeting, I will let you know where we stand and what we can reasonably expect.   If we cannot resolve everything, I'll confer with you before taking it up with Louise.JohnPS Please note the following exchange.   Please let me know if you want for me to soften my position.---",

I look forward to our getting together to nail down the details while there is still an opportunity to make necessary adjustments. On the subject of cover letters, there are several reasons for our approach:Given the urgency of completing the necessary pieces of the   mailing, it is more expedient to include two letters than to go through approvals on a new joint letter.We want our counterparties to understand that there are two avenues of communication into Enron - EnronOnline (initially in English) for its e-commerce platform and Enron Japan for a host of Japan specific business lines.   It is important that we position them as separate but complementary.   It's very easy for people in this market to confuse multifaceted business interests.   To be effective, we need to direct them to the appropriate sources/authorities.At this point EnronOnline will only be available in English, so potential users would need to be able to read your letter in English anyway.   However, in following Japanese protocols, many of the packets will need to be sent to higher level officials, who would then pass the packet on to the end users.   These are the people that we need to notify of Enron's Tokyo office and that EnronOnline is one of the many products and services available through Enron.   It is essential that this higher audience have the name of just the top Enron official in Japan, otherwise they may think that they should bypass the Enron Japan office and always go to Houston.   (In this culture it is a real risk.)   This would   jeopardize Enron's strategy for Japan.I hope the above mentioned considerations are helpful.   I look forward to discussing this further when we meet Monday.John   David Forster@ECT03/31/2000 07:111 PMTo: John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRONcc: Mario Parra Cardoso/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kal Shah/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Japan   John,It seems strange to me that we will not be translating the cover letter.

      "body": "\nAlan:Regarding the legal comments below:My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue:   i.e. the umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice of law provision.   These agreements have been approved by local counsel in Japan.   This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.   As is the case for all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the counterparty is situated.   When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that bridge is still ahead of us.I don't know what the \"international contracts\" are that Rousseau refers to.   There is no standard agreement for online trading.   The ETA provides that if a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place (such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions.   The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed.In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, the legal side of things is ready to go.MarkAlan Aronowitz04/03/2000 111:52 AMTo: Joseph P Hirl/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rousseau Anai/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Japan   I have copied Mark Taylor on this note and asked him to call me to discuss.

In fact, as she becomes more familiar with EOL and its structure/issues generally, she will make a great back-up for me for all EOL issues.Louise Kitchen01/25/2000 111:21 AMTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: EnronOnline PAsWe are experiencing an high level of cusotmers wishing to speak to a lawyer on the EnronOnline agreements and bearing in mind you have other jobs we need to have someone permanently manning the phone for all the industrials.   Could you get another Edmund type working for you who mans the phones permanently so we can get people on the system immediately.ThanksLouise\n"

It sounds like a valid concern - any reason we can't just send people to the web site and ask them to print out the relevant PA?Mark\tSheri Thomas\t10/03/2000 10:05 PM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: EnronOnline PAsMark -Now that my responsibilities have been increased to include both EnronOnline and Clickpaper, something was brought to my attention that I am concerned about.   Clickpaper has been instructed not to send password applications to customers via e-mail.   This is something we have been doing since the inception of EnronOnline.   The concern is that customers will alter the language in the agreement, sign   and return it to us - hopefully, this will not happen, but could be a valid concern.   I am hoping you can shed some light on the original decision that was made to allow sending the PAs to customers electronically.   One solution that we could implement in the future is to send the file to the customer in .pdf format; however, the customer will need the applicable software to launch the program (we could include a link to download this).   The immediate solution is to discontinue this practice until I have discussed it with you.   I know you are out of the office until Monday, and I am out the rest of the week as well.   Please let me know your thoughts when you return.Thanks!Sheri\n"

The principals to the metals trades would therefore be the US Corporate and ENA.   These trades would however be \"arranged\" by MG London Inc. (an FCM) as \"arranger\" in the US for ENA.o Enron Metals Limited (EML) from London would agree to provide metals prices to ENA and/or MG London Inc. in the US, and in return receive a commission from MG London Inc.o ENA would back-to-back OTC metals derivatives with EML via an intra-group ISDA Master.Look forward to your views.Thanks.Justin\n"

I've atached an example (but I'm not sure it is thefinal version).MarkDavid Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT111/17/999 02:53 AMTo: Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Justin Boyd@ECTcc: Mark Taylor@ECT Subject: Enron OnlineEdmund/Justin, I would appreciate your advice on a few points.   I am correct in understanding there can be different versions of the   Password Agreement and Electronic Trading Agreement?   I have seen Password Agreement NA Version 1and an Electronic Trading Agreement Version 1 that both have Enron North America Corp and/or its affiliates as the Enron contracting party.   In Australia we will have to enter into   electricity derivatives through the Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.(EAF)   which is the only Enron entity authorised trade in these products. Would EAF also be a party to a Password Agreement and ETA with its potential counterparties?If   I   was starting with a clean sheet in drafting GTCs for Australian financial power trades I would incorporate into it the   19992 ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)and as well as the 19993 Commodity Definitions. This is what Australian counterparties would expect to see. However, I notice this approach has not been followed with any of the GTCs I have seen. The closest is the incorporation   EFA terms   for the UK power contracts. I suppose this raises a general question are there any established protocols for drafting GTCs? Small point - I notice the limitation of liability clauses in all the documentation follows the US form.   I notice even for contracts interpreted under English law there is an exclusion of \"special damages\".   In Australia and I thought England special damages were defined money damages that must be specially damages as opposed to general damages such as pain and suffering that cannot be quantified and are assessed by the court. This is completely different   to the meaning of this term in US. Has this issue been considered and for whatever reason a decision has been made to go with the US wording?   How much work have we done on issues such as those relating to formation of contracts? I note it was excluded from the scope of your surveys of the various European jurisdictions. I am taking my brief to include those issues relevant which are material to ensure that Enron is complying with the law and will also have enforceable agreement. This may go wider than just regulatory compliance issues.If you prefer give me a call to discuss 612 92229 2310.   \n"

These relate to thedemo of the game I was sent a while back (i.e. a \"Five Flags Down Under\"demo) and may therefore have been superceded (or the impact lessened) byevents.a)   Under the \"edit groups\" section in the demo contetstants are told   \"wantto have your own private Unamed Contest for friends, colleagues orco-workers?   you can! it is simply a matter of choosing a group name,entering a group password and telling your fellow contestants to go to thispage to join etc\"I assume that since fellow group members need to register, the \"friends,colleagues and co-workers\" are all actually employees of Enron customersanyway i.e. they can register in their own right if they want to?   Is thisthe case?   If it is the case, perhaps it should be made a bit clearer thatan employee of an Enron customer can't   include friends who don't work forEnron customers in their group.b) Our Intellectual Property department have   \"flagged\" (excuse the pun!)the issue of using national flags in a commercial setting.   Use of the UKflag wouldn't seem to create problems - there is no copyright in the flagbecause it is over 2000 years old and it is widely used on, for example,T-shirts as decoration.   However, they believe that there might be issuesassociated with using the US flag -   this flag doesn't, for example,routinely appear as a decoration on T-shirts etc.Is this something that has already been thought of and dismissed in the US?We believe that, in practice, national governments might not take action toprevent the use of their flags in/on commercial products, as long as the useis in good taste.   In addition, we believe that copyright provisions inflags are normally only enforceable within those particular countries.Flags are usually restricted under international copyright law from beingregistered as trade marks, but consent can be obtained to waive theserestrictions, so there is a possibility that particular national flags couldbe registered trade marks.Given the particular circumstances of the game i.e. the flags are being usedin \"good taste\", for a limited audience, for a limited time,   and Enron ispresumably not seeking to obtain an unfair advantage from using thereputation of the flags, problems do not seem particularly likely.   Mysense is tha,t if the use of flags is thought a \"non-issue\" in the US, thenit is probably even more of a \"non-issue\"/less of an issue   in Europe, butif you would like me to take this further/check with the various EUjurisdictions, please let me know?ThanksRachel___This message is confidential.

In fact, we used that language to mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms when they first signed up for EnronOnline.

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms for GTC-governed   transactions without asking the customer first.   Whether or not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will leave to others.   Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally available...\tAndy Zipper/ENRON@enronXgate\t04/25/20001 08:41 AM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: FW: Elimination of Confirmations for EOL TransactionsQuestion:Does the ETA trump any language in an existing ISDA regarding the signed confirm being the governing doc for a trade ? ---Original Message---From:   Beck, Sally   Sent: Tuesday, April 24, 20001 1:24 PMTo: Gros, Thomas D.; Zipper, AndyCc: Piper, Greg; Reeves, LeslieSubject: Elimination of Confirmations for EOL TransactionsLeslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on EnronOnline.   Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.   This elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.   Next steps:   Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution of a transaction (ease of availability, type of   record available, retention schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?)   Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for elimination of confirmations - large number of   transactions, those that have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot)   Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth   Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on   ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting) \n"

Buying a stronger whip.   2.   Changing riders.   3.   Threatening the horse with termination.   4.   Appointing a committee to study the horse.   5.   Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.   6.   Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.   7.   Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse.   8.   Creating a training session to increase the riders load share.   9.   Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.   10.   Change the form so that it reads: \"This horse is not dead.\"   111.   Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.   12.   Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.   13.   Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting   its full original cost.   14.   Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.   15.   Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would   improve productivity.   16.   Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.   17.   Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs   better.   18.   Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.   19.   Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.   20.   Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.\n"

As we discussed in our conference yesterday, Envera cannotpermit DealBench or EnronOnline to disclaim consequential damages that maybe payable to a plaintiff in a trademark infringement action.   Envera is notseeking to recover Envera's own lost profits or consequential damages, justthose that Envera must pay to a plaintiff in an infringement action.Envera's request is that a statement be added to the indemnity sectionclarifying that any damages awarded in a final judgment or paid insettlement of an infringement claim be deemed \"direct\" damages.   Dean statedin yesterday's e-mail that DealBench, as a matter of policy, does not agreeto such requests.After some discussion among Envera business people, Envera is uncomfortablewith the position taken by DealBench and Enron on this issue.   If DealBenchand Enron are not prepared to stand behind the trademarks that they sovigorously protect in the Linking Agreements, then Envera is not prepared toshoulder the risk that Envera would be required come out of pocket for aplaintiff's lost profits.   Envera is not able to control the risk thatEnronOnline and DealBench have chosen infringing trademarks, other than bynot establishing the links at all.If the concern of DealBench and EnronOnline is that they could be requiredto pay punitive damages that arise from Envera's misuse of the trademarks,this eventuality is already covered in the indemnity provision.   Neitherparty is required to indemnify Envera for infringement claims based upon anyuse of the marks not expressly authorized under the Linking Agreements.I have attached drafts of the two Linking Agreements, marked to show thelanguage that Envera would like added to Section 4&amp;copy;.   Please review theproposed changes and let me know whether they are acceptable to DealBenchand EnronOnline.   If not, Envera will need to consider whether it will evenestablish the links.Regards,JonathanJonathan R. PondHUNTON &amp; WILLIAMSRiverfront Plaza, East Tower951 E.

      "body": "\nBill -Sorry for the delay --- I was out of town and believe it or not Enron doesn't have a local access number to its computer system in Monmouth, IL so I just got your message this morning.Don't worry about sailing skills.   Among the rest of us we have that pretty well covered.   We may be a bit rusty but I'll bet we can keep the boat moving in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any serious damage.   We're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in the world to sail around for a few days.   Navigation is easy (you can always see where you're going), the waters are protected (no big waves) and the wind consistent and not too strong (so the boat will move but not be hard to handle).   The skills you mentioned (sitting, drinking &amp; socializing) are in fact the critical skills for a trip like this.   We sure don't want anyone on board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas!If you want a sneak preview, try The Moorings website --- ww.moorings.com.   Under \"Destinations\" we're going to the British Virgin Islands.   Under \"Charter Fleet\" we'll be on a Moorings 463.Since you have your tickets, please send me your flight arrival information.   I need to pass that along to The Moorings so they will pick you up at the airport.   About the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food and drinks.   Amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so Linda &amp; I will take care of most of that.   Any particular beverage requests?   Beer, wine, liquor, sodas, juices, mixers?   And finally, just a bit if extra info:1.   Your cell phones will not work in the BVI.   We will have a local cell phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there.   If you need to leave a contact number with someone, give them the Moorings' number in Tortola (284)494-23332.   They'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if a call comes in.2.   A lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for renting moorings for the night (much easier than anchoring - Amanda can explain), meals out, departure taxes, incidentals and whatever but there aren't going to be lots of ATM's everywhere so you should bring what you think you'll need.   US Dollars are the currency.3.   You will need your passport but there are no visa requirements.4.   Use soft-sided luggage (easier to stow   on the boat) and try to carry everything on --- if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later.   That's about all I can think of right now.   Feel free to ask any other questions.   I'm starting to get excited now too.   It's hard to believe it's less than 3 weeks away!

The only thing I know how to do&lt; on a boat is sit, drink and socialize.   I have no idea how to make the&lt; boat move in any direction.   I am trusting that you have some idea how to&lt; do this.   I can wind rope and stuff like that though.   And I am generally&lt; good company.&lt;&lt; Actually, I am really looking forward to this.   I picked up our tickets&lt; yesterday and can't wait.   The day is only a few calendar pages away.&lt;&lt; You need to let me know how I can help with preparations and expenses and&lt; whatever else needs to be done.   I can't count on Amanda for any guidance.&lt; All she can seem to remember from prior sailing trips is drinking.&lt;&lt; Bill McGovern&lt;&lt; P.S. Sorry we missed you in D.C. a few weeks ago.

Why Yawning Is Contagious: Youyawn to equalize the pressure on your eardrums.

I would appreciate your comments---any and all are welcome.

As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada. (3)   If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron Canada and ENA.Let me know if I can be of any help.Mark T.\tPeter Keohane\t05/09/20001 03:28 PM \t\t\t To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sharon Crawford/CAL/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Financial Transactions - Enron Direct CanadaMark (and Mark) are there any concerns with Enron Direct Canada (EDC) (the mass markets retail affiliate, that is soon to be a subsidiary of EES) as opposed to Enron Canada (as wholesale affiliate of ENA) entering into financial transactions?   To date EDC has been entering into physical transactions only for gas and power under forms that have been developed based upon our wholesale physical contracts, Enron Direct UK's form, and compliance with the local regulatory requirements for retailers.   If EDC was to enter into financial transactions, they would tend to be papered under omnibus financial GTCs with EDC (as ISDAs would likely not be marketable).   Of course credit would need to be obtained in advance, and the transactions are not booked until the counterparty executes the paper.   Please let me know.Peter.\n"

FYI, \"FirstCall\" allows online realtime access to a wide variety of debt and equity focused investment house/broker reports.We originally had access via a trial that was apparently initiated by a \"C. Weber\" who was based out of Houston but who has subsequently left the company.Unfortunately, access to this service has been withdrawn by Thomson Financial here in London on the basis that we are a \"corporate\" and not a \"financial\" or \"fund manager\".   Thomson Financial are now offering us a reduced time-delayed service (\"Investex\") which is not sufficient for our needs and consequently we would like to reestablish the FirstCall service or a service providing similar or superior functionality.Prior to meeting with Thomson, I would very grateful if you could enlighten us on any of the following:- Whether Enron has any relationship and/or agreements in place with Thomson Financial in the US;- If the latter is the case, which services we receive from this data supplier;- If this is not the case, which alternative but similar data services we do receive.I believe that if we can establish that we already receive the FirstCall service in the US it would greatly strengthen our case for receiving it here in the UK.   Alternatively, if we do not receive this service in the US it would be extremely valuable for us to know what alternative, but similar, sources of information are available, in order that we might have another option should Thomson Financial prove to be inflexible on the issue of supplying FristCall.Should you have any queries in relation to any of the above, please do not hesitate to contact me either by return or on the direct number below.Thanks for your help with this.RegardsSimon Duff (### 444 20 77783 4585)\n"

I think the best qay to proceed would be with a manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with the technology.I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the terms would be dependent of their availability.

      "body": "\n I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=\r=20\rlooks like he's going to insist on the CSA.   We are going to talk tomorrow=\r=20\rand go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.   While =\rwe=20\rhave documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20\rmaster agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.   Many=\r=20\rof these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20\rtrouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.   It would be=\r=20\rhelpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20\rmark-up.\r Following are my points responsive to their revisions:\r Part 1 (a)   The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=\r=20\rpossible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20\rexample, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=\r=20\rthis agreement would be in default).\r (g)   This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=\r=20\rto the other party.   It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=\r=20\rreason to remove it.\r Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.   Our original version spells=\r=20\rout exactly what is expected of the parties.   If the documents we listed ar=\re=20\rnot acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=\r=20\ragree we will put it in the agreement.\r Part 4 (f)   By deleting the word \"not\" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=\rt=20\rpayments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=\rt=20\r(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=\r=20\rmake the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=\rne=20\rpayment).   This is not acceptable.\r (h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=\rNA.\r Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20\rreceive payments due even though technically in default under another=20\rprovision of the agreement.   Our position is that if there are no other=20\rpossible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=\r=20\rhonored.\r &amp;copy;   The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=\r=20\rcity.   For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=\rot=20\rimpossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20\r (e)   The change to 10 business days is much too long.   This means we can no=\rt=20\rhave certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!   We can go=\r=20\ras high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20\rpractice.\r (g)   Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=\ro=20\rmultiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=\r=20\rIBJ branch as a separate entity.   This may not be an issue if we will never=\r=20\rtrade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=\r=20\rwill never do business with any other branch of IBJ.   We usually don't like=\r=20\rto restrict ourselves that way.\r (i)   We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.   If=\r=20\rthere is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=\rt=20\rwholesale deletion is out of the question.\r (j)   As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=\r=20\rmaintaining flexibility within the corporate family.   Given the frequency=\r=20\rwith which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=\r=20\rimportant to us.\r (k)   This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=\rt=20\rwent into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =\r=20\rWe disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=\rur=20\rrevision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=\rr=20\rhigh rate given their status as a bankrupt.   We feel the non-default rate i=\rs=20\rmore appropriate.\r (m)   I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20\rprotects us both.\r (n)   You know more about this than I.\r Part 6   These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20\rindividually if they object for some articulated reason.   If these provisio=\rns=20\rare not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=\r=20\rsignificant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=\r=20\rand we need to know now if they object to any of them.\r Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.   =\rI=20\rhope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.   I'm happy to discus=\rs=20\rany of these issues at greater length if you want.

My paperwhites haven't bloomed yet - I do remember from the last time I grew some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering.   I wonder if people grow them outdoors when the weather warms up.   The smell might work better with more room to disperse.   This time I have six coming up all at once - I hope I can stand it!Love,Mark\n"

My understanding of EOL is that it presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible commodity trading instruments.As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would move the assets to Enron, for example.This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into.

      "body": "\nBob:Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.   The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.   That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot   of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere.The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.   About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.   There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.   Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.   [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.   Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging --- as opposed to speculation --- was safer and therefore more palatable.   The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.

The threshold issue is that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents before trading.   That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic corporates and takes a lot   of legal resources that so far have been spent elsewhere.The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates to regulatory uncertainty.   About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, orchestrating a bail-out.   There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge funds - none of them good.   Our view is that the regulators will be paying much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.   [In case you're interested: notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.   Much of the federal regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging --- as opposed to speculation --- was safer and therefore more palatable.   The failure of a large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the financial markets.   Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or individuals - for similar reasons).

My understanding of EOL is that it presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible commodity trading instruments.As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would move the assets to Enron, for example.This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into.

I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce which is relatively new.   The most fun work project I've had was being the lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading platform about a year ago.   It has been tremendously successful.   While few people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in the world!I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international mutual funds in New York.   My work takes me there several times a year and I usually try to see him if I have some free time.   The college is thinking about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).   Ralph V. was there - whom I hadn't seen in years! - and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.   I was on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.   There were only 2 of us from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see familiar faculty faces.   With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a terrible commute.   I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.   I rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me know if you ever make it down this way.Mark\n"

It does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we should revisit   the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password Application on the EOL registration screen. As I raised in my email last week the Hong Kong regulator (SFC) has issued internet trading guidelines that state that internet sites that \"target\" Hong Kong residents will be expected to comply with HK securities legislation. Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on making public offers regarding (i) securities; and (ii) \"investment arrangements relating to property other than securities\".   Whilst it is difficult to see how a HK weather swap (or any other product listed on EOL ) would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong residents. My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password application for Hong Kong residents. The SFC could well take the view that a HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong. Again it is the act of making the offer, not entering into the transaction that is the subject of the Ordinance. Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades   may not be viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made.   l   have had an opportunity to review a 27 September 2000 advice that Jonathan Marsh obtained from Allen Overy (HK). In Section 2 they raise similar concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance. Way ForwardI would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be removed from the list on the EOL registration screen, at least for the present. The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC needs to be recognised. (This possibility exists irrespective   of the decision to list HK weather products. Clearly on a practical level a greater awareness in HK of EOL   generated by the launch of HK weather may be the catalyst that attracts   SFC interest.)   Whilst our legal analysis has not identified any   breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we mitigated the risk of an   SFC instigated dialogue on this point.   This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password application.If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the public (ie where no password is needed) provisions that are unambiguously directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC first. I note Allen &amp; Overy also raised this as a possibility.I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas. But the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present.

      "body": "\nMartin:My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for an office for you here on the 38th floor.   The room number is EB3850.   Sylvia is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office and will talk to HR about a badge.   HR should have the badge waiting for you at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.   If it isn't and your HR person is not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x333427 and she will tell them to let you in.   Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.   If you haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered lots near the building on Monday morning.   They are more reasonably priced than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you don't have a contract).   We're looking forward to seeing you!Have a good trip.MarkMartin Rosell01/12/999 07:57 AMTo: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: HoustonMark,All systems ready to go on Friday morning.   I thus expect to be in the office on Monday morning (18 Jan.).   Could you please ask one of the assistants to help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of the requisite gear).   Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact with Houston H/R, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on Monday morning).I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the Legal Dept on 18 Jan.Martin\n"

      "body": "\nJohn - While we can delete Part 6 it then becomes necessary to add additional language in each confirmation which is not part of the templates for transactions used by the back office.   Each transaction would therefore require significant additional time and effort to prepare making it more cumbersome to do business with that counterparty.   There is no down-side to having the language in the master - the whole point of the master is that we agree to these things now so we don't have to deal with them at the confirm stage.   You can say \"it's enough if the terms are referred to in the confirmation\" for ALL of the terms of the master.   Since we would insist on the appropriate provisions being in the confirm in any event, if they have a problem with this language we need to know now what the problem is.   With respect to the CSA, that is an issue for Credit.   It is certainly not necessary to have a valid agreement but it is necessary if you want to insist on collateral.   In this case, if IBJ is a stronger credit than Enron it may well be that the csa is more of a burden than a benefit.   It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.   \tJohn Viverito@ENRON\t08/30/2000 07:49 PM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Jonathan Whitehead/AP/Enron@Enron\t\t\t Subject: Re: IBJ ISDA MASTER AGREEMENTMark-We have received some preliminary comments from IBJ, attached hereto for your review.

The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES person is looking to enter into a long term EES transaction.   We sent them a draft ISDA for future transactions out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit Support Annex (CSA) is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal.   She has stated that they are not able to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their Credit support agreement.   As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot have any liens thatsecure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 million.   Can you please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a lien, and if this type collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement.   If this is a breach can you suggest other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable.ThanksRussellNegative Pledge.

(Another option would be to mix and match - taking cash up to $10 mil. and L/C's beyond that.)   Lenders frequently set up the facilities available to the borrower this way so they keep control over how much \"debt\" is supported by the asset base while still giving the borrower some flexibility.   As you can imagine, most other extenders of credit are willing to take the bank's L/C in lieu of a lien on a hard asset.\tRussell Diamond\t01/08/20001 06:42 PM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: ISDA Collateral QuestionMark, Letters of Credit are available under this Credit Facility.Please let me know your thoughts and if you need any additional information as the originator in EES is calling for me.ThanksRussell.From: Mark Taylor on 01/08/20001 05:39 PMTo: Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: ISDA Collateral Question   Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the issuance of letters of credit?\tRussell Diamond\t01/05/20001 05:20 PM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: ISDA Collateral QuestionMark,I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to certain negative pledges.   The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES person is looking to enter into a long term EES transaction.   We sent them a draft ISDA for future transactions out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit Support Annex (CSA) is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal.   She has stated that they are not able to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their Credit support agreement.   As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot have any liens thatsecure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 million.   Can you please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a lien, and if this type collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement.   If this is a breach can you suggest other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable.ThanksRussellNegative Pledge.

We think there are arguments both ways on this, but wonder whether we have a \"house view\".   Since the definition is not expanded in our standard ISDA schedule, we assume that our preferred position is to exclude derivatives transactions from the cross default provisions of the ISDA.Perhaps we can discuss this when you have a spare moment!

ECTRIC trades following commodity derivatives with MS: (a) oil swaps (priced in USD), (b) UK electricity - \"EFA\" elec. forward agreement (priced in GBP) and &amp;copy; Nordic power (priced in norwegian kroner). Are all these commodities covered by the master - at present the latter 2 are probably not covered by an ISDA commodity definition, although I understand A&amp;O plan to work on these definitions with interested parties in UK/Europe. How does the ISDA deal with FX differences - I guess there is a standard approach - GBP and NOK converted to USD at spot rate for collateral purposes.RegardsPaulShari Stack28/10/98 19:111To: Paul Waine/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Paul Simons/LON/ECT@ECT, Marie Heard/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ISDA Master -ECTRIC- Morgan StanleyI was forwarded a copy of your email to Marie Heard and Paul Simons dated 10/19/98. In response to your queries: 1. Date of the Agreement: Notes in our file state that \"Francesca\" in London advised that the earliest outstanding trade between the 2 counterparts is Nov. 4 '93. From a legal perspective, it does no harm to leave the date as is since all it means is that the Agreement is effective as of that day.   2. \"Transferable Letter of Credit\": ECT's standard is to have \"transferable\" L/C's in order to be consistent with the \"transfer\" language included in our Master Agreements. The rationale is that if ECT wanted to transfer its rights/obligations under the Agreement to an Affiliate, we would want the L/C to be transferable as well. Put another way - having a non-transferable L/C would be at cross purposes with having a transferable Agreement. Also, we in Houston were not aware that ECTRIC does not normally use \"transferable\" L/C's. Perhaps this should be made clear to whomever does ECTRIC's documentation in the future.In any case, can you pls let me know whether you are happy for \"transferable\" to remain in or whether I should go back to MS and ask for it to be deleted.   3. Name of Guaranteed Party: Agree to change; Marie will have a new first page of the Guarantee prepared and forwarded to you. 4. Guarantee from MS: The normal procedure is for them to send us their signed Guarantee when they return our execution copies. The form, though, has already been agreed and Marie will send you a copy for your information. 5. Collateral: I have discussed this with Paul Simons. As I understand it,   you have concerns whether in the event of the insolvency of MS, ECTRIC could redeem cash or US T-Bills in order to fulfil MS's obligations to ECTRIC. Mark Taylor feels that ECTRIC would have an enforceable security interest in cash even though it may be held in London. Regarding the T-Bills, Paul   mentioned that there is to be a meeting on this and other matters in the next few weeks. In order for us to go ahead and finalise the Agreement, I would be happy to go back to MS and ask that US T-Bills be deleted as a form of Eligible Collateral.   Pls let me know with regard to points 2 &amp; 5 as soon as possible. Kind regards, Shari Stack   \n"

As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will alsoneed to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are anyoverriding local laws which could impact on the use.   The overseas lawyershave copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line andthe ETA will be posted on the Website.   Each person authorised by acounterparty with a password must \"click through\" the Agreement beforecommencing trading.   This will only be done on one occasion.We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, thata counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it wasnot aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA areenforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitationsof liability etc.   Having said that, the view might be taken that byentering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterpartyreceives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in aposition where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.   Once thecounterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is madeand the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time thatthe counterparty has clicked through the ETA.   I suspect that this is theapproach that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell had in mind.   It is also worth bearing inmind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering intothe ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have hadinternal legal sign off.   This may delay trading.Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAAoff line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents aremarked up with that structure in mind.   As agreed yesterday, I have onlymade changes to the document produced by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell where I thinkit is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.   I have thefollowing brief comments on the changes I have made:1. Parties:   You will see that both documents are entered into by adesignated Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron groupundertakings.   The reason for this is that Transactions will actually be made between thecounterparty and various different Enron entities.   We therefore need to ensure thatsuch Transactions with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of thesedocuments. I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we needto list the affiliates or have one entity enter into the Transactions.   I think there maybe some confusion here. This is not the case.   I assume that the current Enron entitieswhich trade certain commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so onthe Website. The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve thisbut I assume that this causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages onthe Website depending on what password has been inserted.   The documents now contemplatethis.2. \"Services\":   I have removed the references to Services as I am notsure what this means. I would have thought that these agreements need to govern thecounterparty's access and utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry outany Transactions.   Therefore, I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred toServices, it can now refer to \"access and utilization of\" the Website.3. Contract Formation:   I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3of the ETA which provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enrongenerates a message of confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that anyelectronic records of Enron will prevail.   I note that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell envisage adocument being attached which explains this.   This is also acceptable.4. Data Protection:   On reflection, it will be more appropriate forrelevant data protection wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.This is because the data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. livingindividuals, rather than corporate entities such as the Counterparty.   Before providingappropriate wording for this, could you please let me know what information will becollected by you concerning living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.   Forexample, when a password is entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this orcan you intentionally or unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or otherinformation on them once they have entered the Site.   You will need to check this with yourtechnical people.Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have yourcomments.I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleaguesfor their review.   They may have further comments which we will send ontoyou as a matter of urgency.Kind regardsAndrew Wilkinson &lt;&lt;EnronAgC.doc&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;EnronAgMU.rtf&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;TradingAgc.doc&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;TradingAgMU.rtf&lt;&lt; - EnronAgC.doc - EnronAgMU.rtf - TradingAgc.doc - TradingAgMU.rtf\n"

Please see my note to Paul below.   It feels a bit like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan &amp; Cromwell (as suggested by Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.   The target consists of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.   My understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its customers should take.   Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in this worth investigating further?!

Our tax compliance system is premised upon the trading \"pattern\" (type of trader, location, etc.) represented to us in the materials pursuant to which we establish a counterparty.   In this case, J Aron is transacting via either a different legal entity in London or a branch of the entity that was initially approved that is located in London with a password acquired on the basis that they would be trading from New York (presumably from a U.S. corporation).   In either event, while there may not be an issue as to this particular transaction, because we do not know the type of counterparty with whom we are transacting, we could potentially have a U.S. tax withholding issue when settlement payments are made (this, of course, assuming that we settle with the London branch/entity trading with the U.S. approved password).   Consequently, we would prefer to more tightly contain the trading patterns of counterparties and not permit this type of trading (doesn't this violate reps made in the GTC?).   Alternatively, if all that is occurring is that a U.S. approved counterparty is using a password to transact from a different physical location, this presents an issue for the counterparty (namely, creation of a taxable presence in London or such other location) but, so long as we only settle with the approved counterparty under the terms pursuant to which their account was set up (i.e., in the U.S. in the case of this transaction), this should not present an issue for EOL.

She said she would send one to us.Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub user.

He's still trying to talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out what I really want.   I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the continent that's warm.   Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.Let us know when you find a place to liveMark\n"

The master user has the ability to open and close sub-user (i.e. individual trader) user ids and passwords.   So if a trader leaves, the back office master user can immediately turn off the user id for that trader.   They can react much more quickly than we can and certainly faster than 5 days.   I suppose the remaining risk there is that the back office person is the disgruntled employee.\tLeslie Hansen\t07/20/2000 02:23 PM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: Kennecott ETAI agree that it's their responsibility for dealing with rogues.   However, Kennecott's position is that all they can do is notify us and rely on us to cut off access once they terminate an employee.   They cannot ensure that the employee doesn't write the password on his or her palm to take it with them.   Apparently, they have had some bad experiences with disgruntled traders.   Thus, their proposal that their notice must be by certified mail and the proviso that we have 5 days to act on the notice.I have a question regarding the back office suggestion --- are you suggesting that no individual trader be given an id but rather you give the id to someone in the back office and the trader has to call that individual to actually submit a trade.   If that's not what you intend, even if the back office or control group holds the password, if the trader knows the password to get into EOL, what's to stop him or her from continuing to access EOL after leaving the company.   The back office can notify EOL that the password should be cancelled, but if we don't act on the notice, what is left for the CP to do.Who should be my EOL contact on this issue and other ETA issues?Leslie\tMark Taylor\t07/20/2000 01:555 PM \t\t\t To: Leslie Hansen/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: Kennecott ETAYou're right, we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other counterparties.

But I was not able to access the actual definition of Unavailable Seconds thru the ww.ansi.org website, but someone here should have them.   There would then also be a cut-off date, beyond which Buyer would not have to be satisfied with only receiving Credits, when the Unavailable Seconds exceed the threshold determined for Product Termination Event thus enabling Buyer to terminate.   But would not this construction become a bit strained if the ANSI standard refers to seconds that are unavailable in an otherwise up and running connection (as the reference to path performance monitoring may suggest)?   When you prepared the document, did you consider explicitly dealing with total non-performance (for example, by explicitly stating, for the sake of clarification, that Unavailable Seconds shall also include the case where no seconds are delivered at all)?   I understand that 10.2 (ii) is based on US regulatory requirements.   Are there any other sections that are solely based on such requirements?Robbi Rossi@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS17/01/20001 21:46To: Peter Traung/EU/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: Late DeliveryPeter,   In response to your voice message, if our supplier fails to deliver on time, we are entitled to collect liquidated damages from such supplier.

It would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the \"agree\" button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work until the agreement had been scrolled through.   I personally think that would create more problems from a commercial point of view since many counterparties will try to click on \"agree\" as soon as it appears without reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away.

He confirmed the following for me:   * Gas Storage data comes from a direct feed from Telerate.   * Lucy Oritz passes on the cumulative heating degree days to Ross.   &lt; Her source is National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration   &lt; web address = http:///www.crh.noaa.gov/grr/wfolocat.htm   - Should you require any additional details and need to make contact with Ross again...

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.) * Candace Spencer &amp; Terri Brian in Enron Canada's office pull this information from two different sources.   * They pull this information together, and fax updates us each morning.   - NGTL Pipeline Data is pulled from http:///www.nrgexpressway.com/ngtl/index.htm   * You must have a password to gain access to this information.   - Canadian Weather Forecast data is pulled from http:///weather.ec.gc.ca/alberta_e.shtml   * Upon reaching the site, you would select the appropriate City.   * Once in the city, scroll down to get the weather forecast data.My apologies for any mis-communications on your original request.

      "body": "\nJay -Thanks for your note.   This definitely falls into the \"(b)\" category.   The problem is that there are soo many things in the b pile already that I can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.   Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.   As for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.   For instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.   Was there ever any follow-up with them on that?   Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to look like an official contract).   Is the Telerate information also available from other sources?   Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very similar information?   Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate regarding the services they provide to us?Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be trying to do this the \"right\" way.MarkJames Bruce   03/30/2000 02:333 AMTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Legal Issues with EnronOnline Newsticker Dear Mark (back from South America?)I received this email from Donna Greif.   It explains the sources for her data which she puts on EnronOnline every day.   As best I know, Mark, we don't have any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from Telerate.We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site (their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their data without a right to do so.   The same applies for Telerate---we don't even give them recognition---we just post their numbers on our site.I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that, but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.   If I don't hear from you, I'll assume that you don't think it's an important issue.ThanksJay---"

Believe it or not, it actually is \"good to be back.\"   And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.   He and I are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.Harry Collins is the emissions guy.   I'm assuming he'll be part of this process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.   My plan is to ask the lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for which they are responsible.   With me here to answer questions that may result in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.   I hope to be able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.   Maybe you can help me prioritize:   should I look first at areas with predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the quality of work to date?Talk to you soon.MarkDavid Forster09/14/999 07:06 AMTo: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Legal StuffMark,Welcome back!I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of EnronOnline:1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email)2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access the long descriptions in the Product Manager 3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who should be looking after this?   Mark Taylor   Leslie Hansen   Jeff Hodge   Janice Moore   Alan Aronowitz   Harry Collins   Stacy Dickson 4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's against the products and see what you think?Thanks for your helpDave\n"

Questionnaire regarding internet trading2. Questionnaire regarding commodity derivatives tradingA couple of points I'd like to make:- the internet questionnaire refers to the European Economic Area \"passport\" (entitling you to trade in one EEA country by vitue of being regulated by another EEA country). Obviously this is not appropriate for S. America or Oceania and Asia. It is possible that you have some similar mechanism.- the energy commodity questionnaire considers commodity derivatives trading. This questionniare was only sent to local counsel in jurisdictions for which we had not already undertaken derivatives due diligence.   In respect of physical commodity trading, based on the due diligence we have done to date in Europe, we have not undertaken any further due diligence for trading via EOL. If you feel that you need to undertake any physical trading due diligence, we have a set of questionnaires which I would be happy to pass on to you to use as you see fit.Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries or questions about any of the above - otherwise, happy hunting!Best regards, Edmund.To: Justin Boyd/LON/ECT@ECT, Edmund Cooper/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Local Counsel QuestionsCan you guys please send over a copy of the questions that were submitted to local counsel in Europe relating to the online trading project?

        " Mark Evans/LON/ECT on 24/02/2000 14:47 ---Stuart Schardin24/02/2000 111:52To: rastin@velaw.com, tchandler@velaw.com, Ben F Glisan/HOU/ECTcc: Donette Dewar/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne Edgley/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Evans/LON/ECT@ECT, Maroun J Abboudy/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Margaux/WhitewingRon/Trina/Ben,I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing and determine what the appropriate course of action is.   As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.   The method by which this occurs is as follows.   Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which are held by Enron).   Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg).   Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) raises approx. $5111 mm of capital and, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $5111 MM.   In other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux.   The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux.   I've attached a structure diagram below.With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.   The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from Donette Dewar below).   My question is how do we achieve this result.   First, is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level?   In other words, does the swap fall under the definition of \"Indebtedness\" (clause (vii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?   If it cannot, is SE Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?   Once the issue of who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.   If we are indeed going to open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy task.   If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need to determine where.   Also, I'm sure this transaction will require Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.   A final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.   I'll be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time discussing these issues then.   Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next week.Best regards,Stuart---",

You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such amendment.   So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you please consider the following:1.

        " Mark Evans/LON/ECT on 24/02/2000 14:47 ---Stuart Schardin24/02/2000 111:52To: rastin@velaw.com, tchandler@velaw.com, Ben F Glisan/HOU/ECTcc: Donette Dewar/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne Edgley/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Evans/LON/ECT@ECT, Maroun J Abboudy/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Margaux/WhitewingRon/Trina/Ben,I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing and determine what the appropriate course of action is.   As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.   The method by which this occurs is as follows.   Whitewing continues to hold the equity interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which are held by Enron).   Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of the projects through the floating leg).   Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) raises approx. $5111 mm of capital and, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $5111 MM.   In other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its receiveable to Margaux.   The net result is that Whitewing receives cash proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a floating payment obligation to Margaux.   I've attached a structure diagram below.With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.   The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from Donette Dewar below).   My question is how do we achieve this result.   First, is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need to occur at a subsidiary level?   In other words, does the swap fall under the definition of \"Indebtedness\" (clause (vii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?   If it cannot, is SE Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?   Once the issue of who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.   If we are indeed going to open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy task.   If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need to determine where.   Also, I'm sure this transaction will require Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.   A final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.   I'll be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time discussing these issues then.   Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next week.Best regards,Stuart---",

Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&amp;E to assist us on the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions.

Our primary concern has not been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled carefully.   These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls generally.   Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem.   Mark\tPeter Keohane\t05/31/20001 111:54 AM \t\t\t To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: William S Bradford/Enron@EnronXGate, Russell Diamond/Enron@EnronXGate\t\t\t Subject: Margin Calls - FinancialMark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit's requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i.e. use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timing, notice addresses, etc.).   It seemed to me that the form they are using may have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is not a drafting exercise on a case by case basis.   Practically, to the extent that the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no substantive concern.   However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in commodity markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circumstances where their credit is getting \"tight\", I can see the lack of contractual compliance perhaps being problematic.   Can somebody in your group develop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron form, the \"industrial\" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.   Please call Russell, Bill or me to discuss.   Peter.\n"

My comments below in red.David Forster111/03/999 09:05 AMTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Elena Kapralova/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: More FAQ'sMark,I'm not sure how you want to handle changes to the FAQ's going forward from a legal approval standpoint. Shall we continue to send you all new questions/answers?In addition to the FAQ's sent to you last week, we also have the following:1. Is EnronOnline wholesale only, or does it do retail?EnronOnline is not intended for available to retail customers sales at this point time.2. What kind of technology does EnronOnline use behind the applications?The EnronOnline system uses various technologies to deliver the final product site to your screen. This includes an Oracle database, weblogic servers, Macromedia Shockwave, HTML, Java and Secure Socket Layer (SSL), among others.3. What is the minimum size or price which can be transacted on EnronOnline?The minimum and maximum size is different for each product and is specified by the Enron trader who is responsible for that product.   It may vary from time to time.   There are no minimum price levels.[It strikes me that there are minimum price levels (for sales by Enron) and maximum price levels (for purchases).]Thanks,Dave\n"

Please note, however, that the availibilty in Swedish courts of equitable remedies such as injuction and specific performance is restricted under Swedish law.   The general remedy in the case of breach of contract is damages.Generally speaking, a Swedish judge would not be inclined to consider matters of fairness or reasonability in respect of a Swedish law contract between commercial parties such as ECT and OM.   In the case of ambiguity, the court would try to establish the intention of the parties using different means of contract construction.   If ECT wishes to ascertain strict reliance on the contract terms and framework, any court discretion could be limited further by way of imposing an 'entire contract clause'. Om's disclaimers for liability are fairly aggressive, but I assume that this is not uncommon in these type supply &amp; services agreements.   I cannot judge to what extent ECT risks incurring any liability towards OM.The relevant Arbitration Act should be referred to as \"(1929:145)\".   More importantly, this Act   (enacted in 1929) is expected to be replaced by new legislation for ad hoc arbitration.   I believe that a bill for the purpose has been released by the Government.   I'm not yet acquainted with the contents of the bill, but even if I dare say that the new arbitration provisions are likely to be moderns and OK you may wish, rather sailing into unknown waters, to propose to OM arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.   I have no personal experience of this institute but ECT has done some due diligence on it (please see Vinge's response to the attached questionnaire), we refer to it in our physical Swedish contracts and it has a solid reputation in the world of international arbitration.   Below follows its own recommended arbitration clause: \"Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with [this contract], or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of ... arbitrators/a sole arbitrator.The place of the arbitration shall be ...The language(s) to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be ...\"If this is the preferred solution, this clause should be reflected in all agreements (and I doubt that OM would reject to it).Please check the address details of OM Gruppen AB (I believe the details may have changed to 'Norrlandsgatan 311105 78 Stockholm'.).Martin\n"

The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial counterparties.   There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.2.   Duke Energy Corporation.   At Mark's direction, I am sending his note below regarding utilities.   Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.   We are in the process of negotiating another 30.   Until those masters are executed and we have the relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot approve them for online trading.   I have made every effort to search company websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility or not.   If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.3.   Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a regulated utility.   I am unable to determine from Credit or their website what type of regulation they might be subject to.   The note is true that Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.4.   Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws specifically provide for these types of transactions.   We will not know this until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say \"no\" for Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.5.   PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an eligible swap participant (or \"ESP\").   CFTC regulation limits the derivatives trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, banks, etc).   Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.   Whenever I say \"not ESP\" or \"not eligible swap participant\" it means they have not met the financial net worth test.6.   The American Coal Company.   See prior note.---",

If we have already satisfactorily concluded the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will be approved.   It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet been researched that we are withholding approval.   The due diligence required involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the utility's counsel.   We usually begin that process only when a trader believes there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to justify the time and expense.   FYI, the due diligence process has in the past revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.Louise Kitchen10/06/999 02:46 PMTo: Mark E Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Port/LON/ECT@ECT, Bob Shults/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Customer DataOn Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October.Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in the system for the launch schedule.ThanksLouiseMark,On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?   ie their decision whether to trade or not.Louise\n"

Assuming that is still the case, it seems to me that a letter sent to the counterparty, but not signed by it, will likely not override the PA and ETA already agreed to.   This seems particularly problematic if the reason for trying to override the ETA is to take advantage of better credit terms in the GTCs.   It seems to me that we would be better off either changing the ETA or supplementing it on-line; that way, we would at least have a click agreement, which the counterparty has agreed to be bound by.   Perhaps we should discuss further.   Thanks.&lt;&lt;&lt; \"Mark Taylor\" &lt;mtaylo1@ect.enron.com&lt; 10/21 111:34 AM &lt;&lt;&lt;This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the creditprovisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want theability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for aletter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade governedby the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).

We have now reformulatedour position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will simply be sent tothe relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to sign and return anydocuments.We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the ETAby stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL system willmean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master agreement.   Wedo not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the ETA.   Obviouslyfor this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented with the 'AcceptGTC' button at the usual juncture in the system.In addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating thatwe will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the creditprovisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty acceptthe GTC over the master!!!).Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.   I alsopresume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in this waywill be effective under New York law.Best regards,Edmund.(See attached file: EOL variation letter.doc)---This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information that may be privileged and confidential.

The Notional Quantity shall be the volume for the relevant Determination Period (calculated using the volume submitted by counterparty).   The Total Premium shall be the price submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline multiplied by the sum of the Notional Quantities for each Determination Period.

The Payment Date(s) shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.The Floating Price shall be the Index. but, I'm not sure if this is latest version we came up with.

He would like the words \"multiplied by the number of days\" removed from the long descriptions of the paper/pulp product types. Should we delete the whole sentence possibly?

Also, I will get Sara's and Susan Flynn's done, just not today. I will be in the office tomorrow, and should complete them then.

      "body": "\nThis letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying those provisions which are subject to the masters.   In my view there are really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.   Most of the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.   In one case I had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow the master to control.   The only sections we had to amend were the first sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of section 6(e).   And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or another.Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and use of the website.   In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like \"Except as set forth under paragraph 3.(b) and &amp;copy; below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe master agreement shall prevail.If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to \"The agreements listed beloweachcomprises a\" or better yet \"Each agreement listed below is a\" rather than \"The agreements listed below comprise the\".

Apparently Warren is in Tokyo on a work assignment until February so it won't be so easy to meet up with him as we'd hoped.   Warren   offered to   try and fly into Singapore this weekend to meet the 3 of us but I told Julia that I'd have to confer with you first when Houston opens today.   However,   following   that conversation, Julia's note (see below)   came in. Seeing that Warren will be in your 'vicinity' next month - it certainly makes far more sense for him to wend his way to Houston in February so I shall tell Julia to shelve Warren's initial offer to fly into Singapore this weekend. I will forward Warren's academic details to you upon receipt from Julia.Thanks,Anita---"

Q2:   Are you aware of any other restrictions that would restrict us from feeding quotes for any of our other physical metals products to Reuters?   (Unfortunately, we cannot post our financial LME quotes to Reuters as this would violate LME rules, hence our desire to at least feed our Physical quotes).Sorry for the short notice but could you get back to me today on this?

The \"$10m total assets\" requirement technically needs to be satisfied at all times.2. No clear definition of total assets but his view is that total assets on a US GAAP basis should be satisfactory.3. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and on lends the proceeds to Affiliate 2 then the receivable from Affiliate 2 would qualify for the $10m total assets test.4. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and the proceeds are used to fund on going trading then if due to losses total assets were to fall below $10m then technically LLC would need to top up total assets for the losses incurred.It would appear from the above that the most effective route is to fund the LLC by way of an interest free loan and for the LLC to on lend to affiliates.\n"

      "body": "\nGive me a call with any questions.Christian Yoder09/27/999 03:54 PMTo: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECTcc: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Request for EditingMark,We are one step away from signing a brand new, much needed master power agreement with Duke, with whom we presently have over $46 million of MTM in the money exposure without adequate contracts.   That one step is over the hurdle of how we calculate termination payments.   Please, as you have so helpfully done in the past,   edit the following conversation between Mr. Know it All and Mr. Struggler.Know It All:   I don't have a lot of time so get to the point.Struggler:   Why can't we supplement   the expression \"present value of the economic benefit\" when we define the word \"Gains\" with the expression:   \"using the Discount Rate\" and defining the term so everybody understands how we calculate the present value of the   gains?Know it All:   I've gone over this a number of times with you before, but here we go again:   there are a number of ways to calculate gains and losses.   when we calculate our gains or losses, we are really just going One method is to go out to the market and asking a third party how much they would charge us (or pay us) to step into the tragically truncated transaction.   Because it is relatively fair, straightforward and easy enough to document, this would probably be our first approach in a default situation.Struggler:   So, why don't we just say:   \"the value of the foregone economic benefit?\"   Why do we even have to say anything about the stupid present value of it?Know it All:   Ahem, because, we want to maintain as much flexibility as possible and another method would be to calculate the total string of payments we might have expected to recieve from the defaulting party reduced by the payments we would have had to make.   Since we will receive the termination payment up front, it isn't fair to get the full amount of that total but rather only the \"present value.\"   In addition, using the replacement transaction (market quote) method the present value is the already built into the curve price that's quoted you numbskull!   Another method would be to unwind our hedge on the other side of the terminated transaction - presumably the amount the counterparty to the hedge would charge (or pay) to unwind that transaction will be very close to the amount calculated by the market quotation (replacement transaction) method.   This last method is quite handy when the terminated transaction was entered into to offset a particular trade or when the market has dried up and there are no quotes to be had.Struggler:   Okay,   my understanding of present value is that you imagine a guy who is going to get $1000 at a future date, let us say, one year from now.   Do you follow me so far?Know it All:   Please.Struggler:   Now, instead of the guy getting the $1000 one year from now, he gets it today.   But, the $1000 today is worth a lot more   than it will be one year from now because the guy is also getting a year of time and time is money and he can invest the money at a known return rate and so if you gave him the full $1000 today he would invest it and one year from now have   $170 instead of $1000 and that wouldn't be fair so you are supposed to give him today just the minimal amount you can get away with so he can invest it and come out with $1000 one year from now.   And so, to figure out how much less than $1000 to give the guy today, you \"DISCOUNT\" the $1000 by some damn rate that everybody seems to know about.   Do you understand?Know it All:   You've pretty well botched it up at a sixth grade level, but that's the idea.Struggler:   So, now, if we are calculating the \"present value of the economic gain\" of a terminated transaction aren't we basically saying that we would have received $1000 in the future for the power , however we now should get $30 because we have discounted it with the sacred rate and so why can't we say that the present value is derived from the \"Discount Rate?\"Know it All:   Your lack of real world experience is painful to behold.   Pleae make sure you call somebody if you are ever asked to calculate one of these things.   The Curves price that is quoted to us by the presumably creditworthy replacement counterparty or the counterparty to a hedge that is being unwound already takes into account the present valuing principle.   And of course, if you end up having to discount a stream of payments, there are big problems.   First, how will you figure out what those payments might have been?   This isn't a loan where principle and interest payments can be caluclated in advance with certainty - the payments will fluctuate witht the floating price in a swap or the cost of replacement power in a physical deal.   And even if we can figure that out how can we agree on the appropriate discount rate?   An in-the-money non-defaulting party wants it to be as low as possible since that will maximize the termination payment received.   But if the non-defaulting party is out-of-the-money then he will want the discount rate as high as possible to minimize the payment he has to make.   And just to complicate things a bit further, these contracts are usually bilateral so we have to be willing to eat what we serve.   So our contract language just says the whole thing has to be \"commercially reasonable.\"   In our view that's enough to protect us from a rapacious counterparty if we default and flexible enough to let us come to a reasonable result when we are the non-defaulting party.Struggler:   I thought the curve was just a list of prices.   You go out to October 2000 and you see $34.   Isn't that number the price we expect to pay for power or get paid for it on that future date and shouldn't we discount that number if we are getting the money one year early?Know it All:   No!   That $34 is the present value amount we would be willing to pay today of what we think for power that will be delivered one year from now.Struggler:   You mean we thing one year from now that power will actually be $1000 and that discounted, it comes back to $34 on our curve at this very moment?Know it All:   You've got it buddy.   Do you think you can handle that concept?   Or do I have to go over it again?   Struggler:   Hmm.   Well I guess so, but why don't we just say   \"the value of the economic benefit based on the Non-Defaulting Party's curve\"?Know it All:   Because then somebody would want to define the word \"curve\" and at that point you are getting too close to our holy of holies and we won't ever define our curve.Struggler.   Hmm.   Okay.   Thanks.   \n"

I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.   It wentby so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.   Apart from a fewtravel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.

We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in and use the Saturday as a day to fly down.   It's much harder to get there from Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to get there.   The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through   Wed. - not optimal from the weekend point of view but doable I suppose   - it just means a 4 day instead of 7 day charter.   If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the smaller boats - and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing won't be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can get rougher).   Plan B sounds like fun too - and then we could all go together later (it seems mean to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a blast to me!

Are you committed to an entire week?   Want to shorten it to a long weekend (or is the travel to much of a pain for you).I don't think there is any plan that will include Bill in 2000.

We could do a long weekend on either of those dates or if you want to take the whole week off, you and I could go for the week and Amanda could join us for part of it.   I don't know how much time you want to spend on this venture.   Do you want to wait until 20001?   Give me some idea what is your first, second, third choice.

But we've had one skipper mention that he wouldn't be willing toraft together with others out of fear for his thin, wooden hull.

In this case, a direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he should have approached either you or Mike.   Sending out an e-mail that might be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly contrary to our core value of Respect.

An Excel Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial products for some utilities under certain circumstances.Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation information to Tana?One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this responsibility.Mark: Can you comment on this last point?Thanks,Dave \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   Tana Jones   15/09/999 20:111 To: David Forster/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: State of Incorporation   Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, state of incorporation.   The biggest consideration with derivatives is the country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading will take place).   For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap trading.   It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.   With utilities, you cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies to one utility will apply to another.   Each utility need to be looked at individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.   I know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.   You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.\n"

Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000.   This amendment would have stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband).   The amendment failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12.   Rep. Ken Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment.   In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction.Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the bill later this week.   The Senate is still the unknown.Call me at any question - Chris---"

With respect to item #1, the first paragraph is fine.   With respect to the second paragraph, what situation is he trying to address?   For example, I thought that in situations where the counterparty clicked on a price and the price changed in the counterparty's favor before the trade was executed, that the counterparty would get the better price.   The second paragraph might negate this as written.   Can a situation really arise where the system misreads a counterparty's offer?   I think that we need to be very careful in what we say here.With respect to point #2, I need to defer to Mark Taylor on this because I thought that the confirmations control, but it could be the case that our electronic records could prevail if there is a conflict between the 2.   That would seem to make sense to me but I would prefer that Mark concurred with this.Carol\n"

First, I believe our agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.   It might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating when it was last refreshed.   Many sites providing quotes like this have a line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.

April 29 and May 3 through 5 are all national holidays (Greenery Day, Constitution Day, National Holiday and Children's Day respectively).   Furthermore, Nick advises that many people start the holiday week early and stretch it into the following week.   This makes our selection of May 1 week for EOL a most unsatisfactory choice.   I would recommend that we shoot for May 10 or 111 (which would conflict with possible high profile participation in an APEC meeting, which I'll be managing) or preferably the week of May 15.   We could introduce EOL earlier, but publicity would be reduced given Rebecca's schedule for interviews and lead time for printing/mailing promotional packets.   It would be very tight, but we could do it the week of April 24.   Rebecca could provide overview interviews, supplemented by an EOL demonstration and your explanation of how this provides a platform to build our business.   Do you have preferences/limitations from a business activity perspective?

Jay/Mark: Until we have a more developed notification process, can we have an electronic log of when a particular ticker item appeared and was then removed from the website? I assume this would have to be some sort of built text field, to account for possible multiple addtions and removals. Is this simple or hard to do? This would be more reliable than a manual log, and if generated manually, would hopefully be more admissable in court (Mark, can you comment?)Sheri/Amita/Dale: Until we have a system solution, can you ensure you coordinate on some sort of manually maintained notice log?Thanks,Dave\n"

      "body": "\nChristian,I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the Armada.   The \"Spanish Armada\" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.   The Armada was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around the English Channel.   Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.   Of course, the English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and you'd have to say \"on\" in the early 18000's   when Nelson \"broke the enemy line\" at the battle of Trafalgar.   I believe that was during a time when the Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.   The battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.   I'm pretty sure it's somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't see it on the map either &amp; wonder if it has a different name in Spanish.   Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?   The English victory has in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 2000 years earlier that it ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always referred to as the \"trading policy\" but is officially referred to as the \"Risk Management Policy.\"   It most definitely covers Portland trading operations.   I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.   Ted Murphy now has responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy.   I don't have a current version but will ask Ted for one.MarkChristian Yoder05/222/999 111:12 AMTo: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Trading LimitsMark,   I haven't had a chance to plunge into the book you lent   me at the conference because I am flailing around wildly in   as much as I can about certain Spanish topics before early July, including such things as, of course,   Cervantes, a man whose mind I have come to love almost as much as Shakespeare's, the   Catalans,   the Spanish Civil War, the War of Spanish Succession, the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada.   I have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval history.   Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?   Where the hell is Trafalgar?   I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map.   On the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.   When one considers   what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking, one is involuntarily   caused to cast one's badly   jaundiced commercial-legal   mind upon   recent events of an analagous nature on board our own beloved ship,   sailing as it has been   in the northern   commercial straits.   Has our   mighty Armada sailed out onto the seas of deregulation, only to meet the ...   perhaps I shall cease articulating   this line of thought and dwell upon the ingenuity of the Engish.   Anyway,   I have come to a point here in Portland   where I need to go back into the policy context of our trading business.   I recall in Houston that   we had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits and articulated responsibilities.   Do you still have close contact with those policies and if so, is there a discrete document that pertains to the Portland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of it?   I want to ground myself again in the fundamentals so my daily battles can be a little more fun.   ---cgy\n"

It would be grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more pertinent to our issues) but I hate to think of Carol left all by herself that much.   Let's see what we can figure out to make sure everything is covered.Sara Shackleton03/01/2000 07:43 AMTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Kaye Ellis/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Trip to BrazilMark:   I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss.   There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the commercial group and the lawyers as follows:1.   March 17 - Milbank Tweed   (Securitization)2.   March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 28).   In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.   Also, I can speak with commercial groups and plan a \"swap\"seminar for the commercial and legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio).   Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.   Sara\n"

As you know, ECTRIC is currently an unregulated booking company for our European financial trading business. As such, ECTRIC is not required to maintain what would otherwise be significant regulatory capital and is not subject to conduct of business rules. ECTRIC's status as an unregulated entity rests on exemptions which available under the Act. It is clearly important that equivalent exemptions are available to ECTRIC (and to the new US booking entity under the proposed reorg) under the replacement legislation.From an initial view, the existing exemptions we rely upon will be available under the new regime.   However, the \"devil's in the detail\" and so I am working through the exemptions in detail with Slaughter and May.Please give me a call on x65666 if you would like to discuss this area.Paul\n"

The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.   Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.   If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.   That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.   My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application --- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.   I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.Mark---"

This is clearly a free walk on ENA on the swap (ENA in essence wears reservoir risk on the swap).   If this is the commercial deal, so be it.   However, I am concerned that the \"$ fallout\" in such event be charged internally to the finance originators and not the trading arm, but I do not know who to talk to about this.   Any ideas?

I had been looking at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be able to poke around in the USVI.   I seem to remember that the Moorings won't let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might want to get special permission.   Now I'm not so sure if the place will still be all ahoo when we get there.   It might not have been the entire group's cup of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way to and from St. John.   My impression is that I might be the only soul on board who would relish that thought - particularly if the seas are still a bit rough from storm effects.   I'm watching the national Weather Service updates as they come out - roughly every two hours.Caution on the Fed Ex package for the doorman - USVI may be the US for INS purposes but not for Fed Ex - they require an international waybill for deliveries there.   You can have the package sent to their Cruz Bay office to be held for pick-up (two day service - guaranteed by 4 pm) or to St. Thomas airport (next day service by 2 pm).   I mentioned in a previous note that the main harbor in St. Thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably figure out a way to get in there if that works out best (maybe go into a different bay, dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport).

According to Mike, the below listed activities are being pursued in Argentina:Wholesale OriginationRetail OriginationEESEnronOnlinePower TradingGas TradingWeather DerivativesEnergy FinanceNetworksAlthough I would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you, I would like to suggest the following (bearing in mind that there is never a clear understanding about \"where you draw the line\"):Andrea:   Wholesale and Retail Origination; EnronOnLine; Power and Gas Trading; Weather Derivatives; Energy Finance.Fabian: Wholesale and Retail Origination; EES; Energy Finance.Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is not a significant difference between Wholesale and Retail Origination deals in Argentina.   In view of this, I would suggest the two of you assist all Origination deals (regardless of being a Wholesale or a Retail deal).   Also, both of you should be involved in Energy Finance as I believe such deals would arise from Wholesale and Retail Origination transactions.   In short, both of you would do legal support to \"Origination\", however, Andrea would focus on Trading and Fabian would concentrate in EES type of deals.In addition, Fabian would manage Luiz Watanabe's workload in Argentina, but I would leave this to Luiz to structure and implement.Kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me with your comments asap.I have not made any reference to \"Networks\" as I have no idea what it relates to ...   Is this related to Enron Communication ?As a final note, please be advised that our baby should arrive on Thursday, July 23.   As of such date, I will be available by e-mail and cel phone only.Rgds,Sami\n"

Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards the name to Credit.   At the same time, the commercial team should be identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).   2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).   If approved, Credit notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron relationships.3. Legal conducts a \"screening\" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the appropriate level of further review.   If the commercial team considers the RE the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.   In addition, if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the \"other Enron relationships\" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.   Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on the website.   Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

Concerning the D_sseldorf project we will meet with Mr. Elberskirch,=20\rgeneral manager of the D_sseldorf B\"rse, on Tuedsday, Jan. 12, between 9:000=\r=20\rand 12:000 in the morning. Mr. Elbersbusch will be accompanied by two McKins=\rey=20\rconsultants, probably Dres. Hirse and Schrader. They will discuss with us t=\rhe=20\rfeasibility study that McKinsey will present at the next \"B\"rsenratsmeeting=\r\"=20\ron Jan. 13 (the day following our meeting). As the study has not yet been=\r=20\rfinalized Mr Elberskirch will not forward any copies or drafts to us before=\r=20\rthe meeting. I have indicated that from our side Jay (possibly), Joe, John,=\r=20\rChris and myself would participate in the meeting.\r 2.The initiators of the Hannover project will meet with representatives of=\r=20\rNYMEX on Jan. 12 at 9:30 a.m. in London. According to Mr. Hagena, who is in=\r=20\rcharge of the project on behalf of the state government of Lower Saxony,=20\rrepresentatives of the \"Stromwirtschaft\", i.e. of the major electricity=20\rcompanies (in particular Preussen Elektra) will also participate in this=20\rmeeting. After this meeting, i.e. between 15:000 and 17:000, Mr. Hagena and M=\rr.=20\rWudy (Commerzbank Frankfurt) would like to meet with us. One of the issues=\r=20\rthat will probably be raised is whether Enron would be prepared to become a=\r=20\rshareholder in the exchange company (\"Tr,gergesellschaft\"); it is planned=\r=20\rthat the initial capital contributions of the shareholders (Stammkapital)=\r=20\rwill amount to DM 20 Mio.=20\rParticipants in the meeting on our side would be the same as in the meeting=\r=20\rwith the D_sseldorf people.\r 3. The \"consensus talks\" on the German energy exchange project are now=20\rscheduled for January 26, 1999 in the offices of the Commerzbank in=20\rFrankfurt. The meeting will be chaired not by the Minister of Ecomics, Mr.=\r=20\rM_ller, but by Mr. Tacke, who is State Secretary in the Ministry of Economi=\rcs=20\rand who has been Federal Chanceler Schroeder=01%s most important economic=\r=20\radviser for the last couple of years. Tacke is likely to be a strong=20\rsupporter of the Hannover project (he served under Schroeder in Lower=20\rSaxony).\rInvited to the meeting are representatives of the large electricity compani=\res=20\r(which have supposedly all already accepted the invitation), seven major=20\rindustrial consumers, natural gas companies (Ruhrgas, Wintershall/Wingas,=\r=20\rBEB), electricity traders (such as VASA and us) and banks (in particular th=\re=20\rCommerzbank and the Norddeutsche Landesbank).

There is a big difference between listing the price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.   The almost public nature of the marketing   may influence whether or not the reference entity is happy with Enron trading the product.   Even if they are not affected in this way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high ground if the reference entity later decides to object.Louise Kitchen02/16/2000 03:49 PMTo: Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECTcc: David Forster/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Goddard/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: letter to reference credits   Remove all references to EnronOnline its unnecessary in this context - suffice to say you will be trading through all the normal Enron methods.LouiseBryan Seyfried16/02/2000 20:24To: David Forster/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Louise Kitchen/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark Dilworth/LON/ECT@ECT, Paul Goddard/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: letter to reference creditsAttached is the letter that we intend to send to CFO/Treasurers of reference credits.

I would be very greatful if you could edit the following conversation and send it back to me like you did last time.   I kept that copy and it has proven to be invaluable. Know it All:   Yeah that CFTC stuff is pretty complicated.   You have to remember though that it is the option of settling financially that distinguishes the futures contract.   If you do a physical contract that has the option to settle financially it is an illegal futures contract if it isn't done on a regulated exchange   and it is just like giving the other guy a free option to termiate for illegality. So the risk in doing these things is that your counterparty can get out on the basis of illegality and secondly, you might find yourself suddenly regulated by the CFTC.   This risk is not to be confused with the other kind of risk which is where you write a mandatory financial transaction but wrap it up in physical clothing.   This is basically the risk of doing an unauthorized derivitive transaction and again, depending on the counterparty, you may have given a free option to terminate for lack of authorization. Tormented: Okay, okay, I think I've got that part, but what's all this option crap that people keep adding into the forumula?   They always say you can trade this and that and then they throw in the options.   Are options over the counter or under the counter or not on the counter or regulated or what?Know it All:   Can't you remember this stuff.   I get tired of repeating it.   Certain kinds of All commodity options are regulated and certain kinds aren't. Can't you just get that once and for all?Tormented:   No.   I've got optionality dislexia.   What kind of option is How are options regulated?   I see our traders doing options all the time and we just write them up in our confirmation letters.   There's no big deal about CFTC or regulation.   What's the problem?Know it All:   Well its like this:   if it is an option to do a futures contract it has to be done on the Exchange.   Any other options are off exchange.   It's just that simple.   Off exchange commodity options can only be done if the offeree (that's the guy receiving the offer) is a commercial user, producer, processor or merchant handling the underlying commodity.Tormented:   Hmm.   I'll have to think about that.\n"

Any comments or problems please reply.   I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email).   1.   Current CustomersWe are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the launch.   These customers will not   receive any documentation from us apart from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy marketing brochure.They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation.   All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these people.Procedure1.   A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled.2.   Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc.3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process (to include whether to send to UK os   US office).   The PA will be specific to each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to each counterparty.4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to Enron. 5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login.6.   The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).   The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either \"I accept\" or \"I do not accept\" (with no default on enter).   This ETA must be printable.7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.   If the customer is transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password).   The system will need to be loaded with the information as to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type.Elena's questionsQ:   Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the \"House\"?   No only in the garden.   PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion).2.   New CustomersThere are two alternative routes possible.Procedure 1: Off Line RegistrationPotential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade online, i.e. get the ID and PasswordEnron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for appropriate jurisdiction.Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to EnronIf the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the system administrator login and password.The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).   The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either \"I accept\" or \"I do not accept\" (with no default on enter).   This ETA must be printable.The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting GTCs for all   products and   any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password).   Procedure Two:   Partial OnLine RegistrationRegistration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in the GardenCustomer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,   print out appropriate Registration Form and PA,   fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it to EnronCustomer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to EnronIf the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the system administrator login and password.The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of origin of the customer).   The ETA must be printable and the customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either \"I accept\" or \"I do not accept\" (with no default on enter).   This ETA must be printable.The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting GTCs for all   products and   any person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under this SA password).   The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but clearly Janine may want to add more on her side.Elena's questionsQ:   1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.   YES - In the   garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for all applications) 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC prefers them to be available...YES3.   Read Only CustomersIf a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are missing.   So we will be sending them a password and login for read only access.   We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we would authorise readonly access.   We will no be advertising read only access as available.They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but view only.   Procedure1.   Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has not registered.   The trading desk with primary trading contact with such counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only access for a period of time.or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only access for one of his customers.2.   The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time dated (only valid for a certain period).3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA   - these are to be country specific.   4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the site where he has been given READ ONLY access.   5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password).6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they should register to continue seeing prices.Elena's issues1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden)2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.   Some customers may be allowed in for one day others for one month.3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not be mentioned in the garden.   The only phrase in the garden refers to customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above).4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line, but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs.Mark's commentsSystem administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned. If they are in reality that is none of our concern.   Agreed - we need to change the name of System Administrator to Trader AdministratorETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it (which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA.Guest only usersThis concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some process queries on it. See above.How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above.What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for full rights?   They need to receive a notice when their password expires which prompts them to follow the application process.2 other queries   -Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understandingLimitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn'tBob's comments1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all other users.The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?   Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get Trading AccessAlternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, single point of reference).The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives.Tim's comments The process you have described is as I understood things, exceptthat for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators,Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).   As we discussed on Wednesday andas Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows: The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online,that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator.Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address,country of incorporation   etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guestuser, the System Administrator will   e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read OnlyETA.   The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it toEnron (by fax or post).   Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.   TheRead Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest.This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going to advertise this read only capability.OK?

We have had that advice updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.   The result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the transaction can proceed.   While I have no legal objection to sending a form of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.Mark   \n"

The language that we inserted in the attached ENA financial and Enron Canada financial GTCs should also be inserted in the ENA financial (credit) and Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs.

The US version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.   We're also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be different from the UK version.   Speaking of which, I was surprised to find that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.   What's the practice in your part of the world?   One alternative is to insert the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time (2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed acceptance.   Would that work for your deals?Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.   Louise is insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.   I'll be calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since I'm sure you will have issues to discuss - and now is the right time to get changes made to the ETA if necessary.---"

      "body": "\nAs presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force covering a particular transaction, the master controls.   I don't think we ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.   For example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA, that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.   However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that way.   They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single Enron entity (e.g. all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless of what master agreements are in place.   To resolve this I suggest that the long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the ETA be revised as follows:revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product \"...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of the execution of such Transaction...\"(underlined text inserted) I think this will please the commercial and tax people; any thoughts from the legal side?\n"

The Proposed Regulations reflect changesmade to Section 12221 by the Ticket to Work and Work IncentivesImprovement Act of 1999.   The Proposed Regulations arepractically identical to existing regulations under Section12221 (the \"Existing Regulations\") with two modificationsreflecting the changes in the law --- (1) they adopt a risk\"management\" standard for defining a hedging transaction(as opposed to the risk \"reduction\" standard used in theExisting Regulations) and (2) they remove the specialrule imposing certain additional conditions on hedges ofnon-inventory supplies.   The Existing Regulations have notbeen withdrawn, but the Proposed Regulations are proposedto be effective for transactions entered into on or afterJanuary 18, 20001.---This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains informationthat may be privileged and confidential.

Raisler=20\r=09David J. Gilberg\r RE:=09Enron Online/Credit Product\r This memorandum summarizes the proposed procedures we discussed during our=\r=20\rmeeting on January 13, 2000 for use in connection with the credit derivativ=\res=20\rproduct (the =01&amp;Product=018) to be offered by Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resour=\rces=20\rInternational Corp. and its affiliates (collectively, =01&amp;Enron=018) throug=\rh =01&amp;Enron=20\rOnline=018.   These procedures, which we will be assisting you in preparing,=\r are=20\rdesigned to reduce Enron=01,s exposure to those entities on whose credit th=\re=20\rProduct will be based (the =01&amp;Reference Entities=018) as well as Enron=01,=\rs exposure=20\rto other related types of liabilities.   We have previously outlined these=\r=20\rareas of exposure in our memoranda dated December 15, 1999 and December 222,=\r=20\r1999. =20\r1. Disclosure =01* All Reference Entities should be advised, by letter, of =\rthe=20\rfact that they will be included in the list of entities that will be the=20\rsubject of the Product.   These disclosures will of course be separate from,=\r=20\ralthough related to, the disclosures to be provided to counterparties to=20\rtransactions in the Product.\r ? This disclosure should inform the Reference Entity of the introduction of=\r=20\rthe Product, and describe the general nature of the Product and the manner =\rin=20\rwhich it will be traded (e.g., through Enron Online).\r ? In general, however, Enron need not request that the Reference Entities=\r=20\rconsent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the Reference=20\rEntities, except as set forth below in paragraph 2.=20\r   2. Consent =01* Enron should, however, obtain the prior consent of certai=\rn=20\rtypes of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference=\r=20\rEntities.\r ? In particular, consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit=\rh=20\rwhich Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or=\r=20\rother services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t=\rhe=20\rReference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha=\rt=20\rcould be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme=\rnt.\r ? Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated=20\rcounterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron=\r=20\rtrades on an exclusively arms=01, length basis with no advisory or similar=\r=20\rservices being provided and with no fiduciary obligations.\r ? Where consent is sought, Enron should include a request that the Referenc=\re=20\rEntity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being=20\rincluded in the list of Reference Entities.   If a Reference Entity fails or=\r=20\rrefuses to execute the letter, Enron will need to make a determination, on =\ra=20\rcase-by-case basis, as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o=\rn=20\rthe list of Reference Entities.   However, it should be recognized that, by=\r=20\rrequesting consent, Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as=\r a=20\rReference Entity in the absence of consent.\r 3. Chinese Wall =01* We understand that it will not be feasible to construc=\rt a=20\rcomplete =01&amp;Chinese Wall=018 between the operations related to the Product=\r and=20\rEnron=01,s other trading activities.   This is due primarily to the fact tha=\rt=20\ractivities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as=\r=20\rEnron=01,s other trading activities.   However, Enron should implement a mod=\rified=20\rChinese Wall between the trading operations.   This approach would enhance=\r=20\rEnron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety=\r or=20\rbreach of duty by facilitating Enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20\rinformation had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20\rProduct. This could be accomplished through a number of procedures.\r ? First, Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20\rseparation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc=\rt,=20\ron the one hand, and Enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand=\r. =20\rEven if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as=\r=20\rother traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the=\r=20\rfloor set off by partitions or similar features.\r ? Second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio=\rn=20\rbetween Product traders and other traders if such information is material t=\ro=20\rthe creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20\rdomain.   In addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe=\rct=20\rto the procedures through training programs.\r ? Finally, senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit=\ror=20\rcommunications between the groups of traders and to review and make=20\rdeterminations on requests by traders to communicate information that would=\r=20\rotherwise be prohibited under the procedures.   These procedures will be=20\rsimilar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron=01,s equ=\rity=20\rtrading activities.\r 4. Restricted List --- Enron should establish and maintain a =01&amp;restricted =\rlist=018=20\rof those entities on which Products may not be traded.\r ? Initially, the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i=\rs=20\rnot feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its=20\rrelationships with such entities; e.g., those entities with respect to whic=\rh=20\rEnron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their=\r=20\rinclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives=20\rmaterial, non-public information.   In addition, those entities with which=\r=20\rEnron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to =\rbe=20\rexcluded, depending on the terms of such agreements.\r ? Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20\rinformation regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed. =20\rPursuant to these procedures, Enron should suspend the listing of quotation=\rs,=20\rand therefore the issuance of new Products, with respect to a Reference=20\rEntity, if Enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20\rregarding such Entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension=\r=20\rnecessary or advisable.   This would include situations in which Enron is=20\rconsidering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity.   I=\rn=20\raddition, the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud=\red=20\ror deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron=01,s possession of information as=\r=20\rwell; e.g., where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20\rrespect to such Entities.=20\r ? The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for=\r a=20\rProduct held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests=\r=20\rEnron to do so.   The procedures should also address the pricing of the=20\rclosing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th=\rat=20\rminimizes Enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20\reffecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20\rinformation.=20\r ? Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel, which should=\r=20\rinclude instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi=\rth=20\rany notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the=\r=20\rrestricted list.=20\r As noted, we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew, which wi=\rll=20\rneed to be integrated into Enron=01,s existing policies and procedures.   In=\r=20\raddition, as we have advised you in our prior memoranda, there are no=20\rprocedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities=20\rarising in connection with its offering of the Product.   However, the=20\rimplementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr=\ron=20\rin mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by=\r=20\rReference Entities.\rPlease call us if you have questions on these or other issues.\r =20\r K.M.R.=20\rD.J.G.\n"

      "body": "\nGlad to hear the rest of your trip went well.   The 'normal' sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone.   In an effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve., pick up the boat on Sunday (you get the boat around noon) and bring it back the following Sunday (by noon), take a shower and head straight for the airport.   Because of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there.   You could do a shorter trip, of course, but I never have.   I've gone for longer (we did a 10 day one-way sail from St. Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada, stopping in Bequia and Mustique, among others, along the way) but that's a pretty long trip and certainly not necessary.   Most of the charter fleets are based where there is plenty to do right in the area for a week.   One of the reasons for aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days spent.   I get both Thurs &amp; Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a whole week - I understand the gov't may not be so generous.   I haven't taken all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 20001 if that works better for you guys.My views on when to go:January - March Very fun since you will be sick of winter, very popular so a lot more crowded (harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements farther ahead), everything is open for business, high season rates.April - MayLess crowded (unless Easter or Spring breaks are late), shoulder season rates.June - AugustNo crowds (you may have some anchorages to yourself), many places are closed for the season (think beach bars and meals on shore), low rates.September - OctoberSee June-August and add in highest risk of hurricanes (http:///www.storm2000.com).   My guess is that people who planned their trips to the BVI for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got   GREAT deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund.   I've chartered during this period several times and had a blast.   One time a tropical storm came through and we stayed on the boat in port - I still get mileage out of the stories.   You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may not go according to plan (not seriously dangerous, though - you're always within easy reach of the base - if a bad one threatens you just take the boat back and let them deal with it).November - DecemberHurricane threat drops dramatically.   Crowds pick up around Christmas, everything opens up again, rates start to go up again.Bottom line:   I love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year - just let me know what works best for you guys.   Keep in mind that you do have to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance (more is better) to make sure you get flights and the boat that you want.One last thought - it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to pick someone up.   This is definitely suboptimal.   You learn a lot about the boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain or wherever.   I'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once but if it's the only way, at least it's an option.Mark\n"

I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.   It wentby so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.   Apart from a fewtravel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.   Tahiti is a trueparadise.I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem isthat my honeymoon has put me firmly in \"vacation deficit\" at the SEC.Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough daysavailable by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.

I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and which were the best times of year, etc.   I haven't heard anything from Amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.   Have you heard anything firm from Virginia?   Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells me that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone for the holiday.   The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule, too.   If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans soon - that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.   If you'd rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.

      "body": "\nBill:I am sending you by FedEx tonight a copy of the most recent edition of the cruising guide to the Virgin Islands.   It's not required reading but I thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be sailing.   Please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if we try and go to any spots we haven't been to before and since it will have the most up to date information on navigation, restaurants, bars, etc. (you will see little hand-drawn charts of the most popular anchorages - these are surprisingly useful).There's a lot of information in there.   If you want to focus on just a few, the places we are (in my humble and easily overridden opinion) most likely to visit are:Road Town - that's where we will pick up the boat so we're pretty certain to be thereThe Bight on Norman Island - deserted island but a floating bar/restaurant, good snorkeling nearbyJost Van Dyke - we have always liked Sydney's Peace &amp; Love in Little Harbor and Foxy's in Great HarborSandy Cay - the classic deserted island, very small - probably just a lunch or quick swim stopCane Garden Bay - a little tricky   getting in but well worth it - the quintessential Caribbean beach (swath of white sand, palm trees, steel bands, etc.)Trellis Bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a restaurant called The Last ResortCooper Island - nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining optionThe Baths - wouldn't be a trip to the BVI without a stop hereBitter End Yacht Club - probably about as far as we'd want to goThere are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on St. John but it is in the US Virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and customs in the BVI, then clearing into the US at Cruz Bay on St. John and then back into the BVI when we go back over there.   Kind of a lot of trouble, particularly since the anchorage in Cruz Bay is so crowded it's impossible to find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in.   We've done it before but my view is that with limited time it just isn't worth it.   Of course, we started this with the assumption that my view isn't necessarily controlling here and I know that Linda particularly likes the restaurant at Caneel Bay (fancy resort) on St. John.   So stay tuned.We will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near Tortola (which probably just means not at the Bitter End or on St. John) the night before your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport.   One alternative is to stay at Trellis Bay - or right across at Marina Cay - that night and just dinghy you over to the dock - it's a 5 min. walk to the airport.   Or we can drop you anywhere else there's a phone since there are taxis that can be called and the island just isn't that big - I don't think it could take more than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other!I put the Moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide.   They aren't that important unless you check bags.   Please be sure to use them if you check anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up with us some day.   I'm not sure, but it may also make it just a tad easier to get through BVI customs when they see those familiar tags.Here are some BVI links if you have time to do a little surfing:http:///people.we.mediaone.net/gkunkel/bviphoto.htmhttp:///www.b-v-i.com/Call or e-mail with any questions.Mark(713)853-7459 (work)\n"

Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our master swap agreement. In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the more intermediate \"Omnibus\" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one or two page confirmation agreement.   I will forward to my group so that they can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.   I will then forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these documents to the customers in advance of the deals.If you have any questions or comments, please call me at x355583.   Thank you, Tim---",

With the commodity energy market going through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a   greater outsourcing opportunity in the future.   We do not seem to have Master Swap Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, and our solutions will involve financial swaps.Thank you. Tim\n"

Agriculture Hearing on OTC derivatives/CFTCThe Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday, December 16 held a hearing on OTC Derivatives and the almost-demise of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) hedge fund.Witnesses included:Panel One:   CFTC CommissionersBrooksley Born, ChairJohn TullBarbara HolumDavid SpearsJames NewsomePanel Two:   Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets, StaffRoger Anderson, TreasuryPatrick Parkinson, FedRichard Lindsey, SECDaniel Waldman, CFTCPanel Three:   Former CFTC ChairsSusan PhillipsWendy GrammWilliam AlbrechtMartin MayerThe only members of the Committee present were Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) and Ranking Member Tom Harkin (D-IA).   Thad Cochran (R-MS) stayed only to make a brief opening statement.In his opening statement, Lugar announced that the Committee would hold hearings and \"seminars\" in 1999 on OTC Derivatives issues as part of Commodity Exchange Act re-authorization.   Lugar also announced that he would be releasing a set of questions for the Committee to consider in advance of next year's hearing.   (I will forward the questions as soon as I am able to obtain a copy from the Committee.)CFTC PANEL:1)   Chairperson Born - her testimony was essentially no different than what she's been saying since May when the Concept Release was published.   She focused her testimony mostly on the LTCM meltdown and did not really speak to the issue of the appropriateness of derivatives regulation by the CFTC.   She only continued to assert that the Concept Release raised necessary questions about the OTC market, and its issuance does not officially mean the CFTC will regulate, but was completely justified and did not cause legal uncertainty or risk in OTC markets.   She said that the LTCM situation arose because of the use of derivatives in \"highly speculative\" activities.   LTCM had excessive margin obligations to futures exchanges, derivatives positions of $1.25 trillion (1000 times its capital), and carried excessive debt.   Born said that the Concept Release raises questions that go to the heart of the LTCM problem:   lack of transparency, excessive leverage, and (most notably) the lack of controls and reporting requirements that allow firms to take positions that jeopardise markets and avoid appropriate regulation.She indicated a hope that the President's Working Group would complete its studies on OTC derivatives and on hedge funds early in 1999, and that the CFTC would work closely with other agencies toward that end.2)   Commissioner Tull - echoed Born's testimony, saying that the LTCM situation raises questions about transparency, leverage, over-lending, disclosure, and systemic risk.   He said the Concept Release questions don't mean that regulation is required --- the responses will be important to the CFTC in dealing with situations like LTCM.3)   Commissioner Holum - indicated that the CFTC should definitely not act until the President's Working Group (PWG) completes its studies on derivatives and hedge funds AND until Congress has evaluated the results of those studies and considered the issue fully in CEA re-authorization hearings.   She said CEA legislation is the appropriate forum for re-examination of OTC regulation.   She added that regulators shouldn't be able to hide behind interpretations of static old regulation, regulations must evolve with the markets.Holum said the LTCM situation occurred due to excessive leverage, arising from a bad investment strategy and over-extension of credit by lenders.   The CFTC should not jump to regulation because of one firm's poor management, this could drive business offshore.   She also said that regulation of on-exchange markets should be examined along with OTC markets.4)   Commissioner Spears - said that while the Concept Release was purported to be a \"fact-finding\" exercise, it shouldn't have been done in a \"vacuum\" without participation from the rest of the PWG agencies.   Congress should have a major role in the debate --- as such Spears and Commissioner Newsome have formally indicated that they will not vote for any new regulation until Congress has considered that matter, at least through September 1999.5)   Commissioner Newsome -   he echoed Spears' remarks, saying that he wouldn't vote for any new regulation of OTC markets until Congress has fully considered the matter and the PWG has concluded its review and studies.   (NOTE:   I had a chance to talk to Commissioner Newsome after the hearing, and he indicated that he would like to take Mark Haedicke up on his offer to visit the Enron Trading Floor.)Questions and Answers:--- Lugar indicated that the CFTC had information about LTCM's problems well before the September collapse (this was reported in the Washington Post).   He asked why they did not share this information with the PWG agencies or act sooner.   Born responded that LTCM (as a Commodity Pooling Organization - CPO) filed audited financial statements and satisfied all reporting requirements in filing the information that the CFTC received before September.   She said the commissioners never saw the information --- staff determined LTCM was OK at that point.   She also said other agencies had some of the same information at the same time.---   Harkin asked the size of the OTC market --- his point being that it is unknown due to lack of transparency.   All commissioners indicated they had no formal answer, but the guess was around $30 trillion.   Harkin asked if there was double-counting going on based on the underlying assets on which derivatives are formed.   Born responded that there is not even necessarily an underlying asset involved, but yes, there could be multiple-counting.   Harkin's comment was that this seemed to him like a \"pyramid scheme,\" and raises serious questions about safety and soundness.   Harking then asked Born if imposing reporting requirements were within the CFTC's exemptive authority under the 19993 CEA?   Born replied simply, yes.--- Lugar asked what expertise the CFTC has in analyzing the OTC market.   Born indicated that CFTC economists and attorneys \"try to keep up with\" OTC developments, but don't devote a lot of resources in that area because they have made so many exemptions for the OTC market.PWG PANEL:Testimony of all witnesses focused mainly on the relevance of the LTCM collapse in their two studies on derivatives and hedge funds.   They all indicated that the PWG was using a consensus process in their review --- no agency's view will be allowed to dominate the studies.   They also stressed the importance of looking at OTC markets as international markets, and coordinating with international regulatory bodies.FORMER CFTC CHAIRS PANEL:1)   Susan Phillips - Said that financial derivatives are easier to regulate than commodity derivatives.   (Note:   She seemed to assume in her testimony that the main participants in OTC markets were banks and financial services firms)   She said that the CEA gives the CFTC very broad authority to regulate, and Congress may want to take a fresh look at this.   She also said that, in addition to greater market discipline, the best way to deal with \"unregulated\" participants in OTC markets would be more adequate disclosure requirements.2)   Wendy Gramm - was a superstar witness, advocating no further role for the CFTC or any other agency in OTC market regulation.   She said that by the CFTC's merely asking questions in 1987, the commodity swap market moved overseas and did not return until the CFTC issued more friendly policy statement and clarifications.   She introduced 2 articles into the record, one that focuses on the CFTC's creating legal uncertainty by asking questions about OTC markets, and another that says that regulators shouldn't use events such as LTCM to advance their own regulatory agenda.   She said that any purported regulations need strict review by Congress and cost/benefit analysis.3)   William Albrecht - said there is no role for the CFTC in OTC markets.   He said that the CFTC shouldn't use the LTCM situation to stretch its regulatory authority to hedge funds.   He reluctantly proposed that the CFTC and SEC be merged, because functional regulation no longer appears to work well due to diversity of participants in the financial markets.4)   Martin Mayer - said the CFTC should re-assert its role in derivatives regulation due to the recent LTCM situation.   He believes that any financial instrument that is a \"bet\" is a derivative - futures included.Questions and Answers:Chairman Lugar asked if OTC market regulation by the CFTC is appropriate.   --- Phillips replied No, there may be a need for additional disclosure requirements, and may be an expanded role for the SEC in doing so.--- Gramm replied No, and there is no need for nay expanded regulation --- the authority should not move to another agency, institutional regulation is sufficient.--- Albrecht replied No, it is too complex and difficult to structure functional regulation of derivatives under the CEA.--- Mayer replied Yes.Attached to this document is the testimony of Senator Lugar and each witness, except Commissioner Tull and Daniel Waldman who did not submit testimony.

      "body": "\nThanks for spelling it out for me.   I WILL be in NYC this weekend and, while I have done it before and found it to be all you describe, would enjoy going to the parade with you.   As I remember it, the trick to limiting the aggravating and full of people factor is deciding where to watch and when to be there.   The embarrassment factor is significantly reduced by refusing to participate in the actual parade oneself and not knowing any participants (or at least not acknowledging them as they pass).   Do you have the time and route?   Maybe we can grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby.As far as getting in the mood goes, try http:///www.bviwelcome.com/ (I should know how to make that a link but I don't).I'll definitely bring the cruising guide and a map if I can find it.   None of the videos I have is right on point (either the wrong size boat is involved or they're too advanced) but I'll bring them along anyway.

Even though they posted a win on the surfacethe numbers behind the numbers painted the true picture. IBM made$.04 a share on hedging currency. What this means is the currencyof other countries went up in value compared to previous levelsand IBM either made money on their currency hedge instruments orthe currency their customers used had gone up in value overthe value assigned when the deals were first done. If you agreedto pay 1 million Baht for a computer when the Baht was worth 125to the dollar and by the time the computer was delivered the Bahtwas worth 1000 to the dollar then IBM would get a windfall profitof +20%. The difference between 125 and 1000 to the dollar. (Thenumbers used are for example only and not accurate) So IBM didnot do anything to earn the extra money except be in the rightplace at the right time. IBM also had less sales than expectedwhich did not go well with analysts.After the smoke cleared IBM had lost -$17 for the day. -$16 blnin market cap. IBM accounted for over -70 points of the Dow lossfor the day.SUNW on the other hand beat estimates by $.01 and announced asplit and only closed down -.444 for the day. It really was notthe fault of SUNW. The Nasdaq was hell bent on following the Dowdown even though it made several nice runs to positive territoryduring the day. Sun had a backlog of $7770 million in orders andmore coming in every day. The CEO said sales were expected toincrease as much as +20% this year. We expect SUNW to continueupward with any Nasdaq rally.The Clinton problem took a hard turn on Friday. With Republicansstarting to defect and looking for an easy way out to avoid morenegative press, the prospects of a dismissal look better everyday. This would help the market some as \"no change\" is typicallyconsidered good news. The Byrd motion for dismissal is not likelyto pass but it set the tone for the future votes.The real culprit again on Friday was the fallout from the Brazilproblem. Continued rumors of other countries possibly devaluingtheir currencies put a cautious tone in the market ahead of theweekend. Even though many very knowledgeable analysts said thepossibility of China or Hong Kong devaluing based on the currentBrazil problem was \"very, very remote\" the more safety consciousinvestors were moving to the sidelines before the close. TheBrazil Bovespa recovered from earlier losses to close down only-131 or -1.8%. All the European exchanges had closed down onFriday as the increasing worry had investors taking profits therealso.Is the U.S. market going down as some bears are saying? We don'tthink so, YET. Without a \"tail wagging the dog\" news event thisweek we feel that positive corporate earnings will continue tomove the market upward. Interest rates are going to remain flat.Inflation is flat, the economy is growing. We have no reason tosell off. The wild card is the Brazil crisis. The DOW, OEX andRUT are all sitting at support on their moving averages. Themarket is down -5222 points in the last two weeks. We are due foranother technical \"relief\" rally this week. With all the negativenews out Friday the fact that the Dow only lost -73 points (ifyou take out IBM) is remarkable. The Nasdaq had recovered froma -38 point early loss and traded +15 until the end of the day\"fear of darkness\" sell off. This is remarkable. The buy thedip mentality is alive and well. There was strong buying at theclose on Friday as well as the early morning dip. As long asbuyers keep filling in the holes we will continue to build astronger base here. Again, the wild card is Brazil and the otherLatin America countries. A news flash on Monday morning couldwipe out the market in a heartbeat. Until the Brazil Real gainssome strength traders should consider playing smaller positions.You can still capture some gains but have less at risk shouldlightning strike.We are at a pivotal point in the market. With all the majoraverages setting on support it will take more bad news to pushus down and less good news to make it go up. There is stillots of buyers in the market. As CNBC reported Friday thereis a huge \"book\" of buy orders at $2-$3 less than current pricesfor many blue chip stocks. As long as these limit buy ordersstay on the books the chances of a substantial drop are slim.Institutions want to buy but not at the top of the market. Theyare using the \"target shooting\" approach we always suggest.The target shooting approach to opening a position is simplyplacing a limit buy order at -25 to -50% less than the currentask and waiting for a dip to fill your order. Sometimes youcan wait days for a dip but in the current market climate weare seeing dips almost every day. Normally the dips are tooquick to react with manual orders but if you have an existinglimit order you can get filled when it happens and sometimesat the low for the day. For instance the SUNW FEB-1000 Callhad a low for the day on Friday of $5.000 and a high of $8.000.It closed at $6.50. The previous close was $7.50. A limitorder for -25% less than the previous close would have been$5.63. You would have filled at $5.63 and could easily havesold again for a +15% to +25% profit.The AOL-140 Call closed Thursday at $14.000. A -25% limit orderwould have been $10.50. On Friday the low for the day was $10and the high was $14.888. You would have filled at $10.50 andcould have easily sold again for +20 to +30% profit the sameday.Most traders would have bought at $13 or more after AOL startedback up. They would be thinking. OK, now it is moving, I willjump in now. While this is not a bad idea it is not as goodas buying cheap. Once you make a decision to buy AOL or SUNWor whichever stock you want, then the next decision is WHEREto buy. If you use this method you will make fewer playsbecause not all options will dip -25% in one day but the playsyou do make will be much more profitable. You will normallybe buying in at the low for the day. Would you like to be ina position cheaper than everybody else?We have had several serious rumors that Microsoft is goingto announce a 2:1 split this week. While the MSFT CFO hadsaid in an offhand remark several weeks ago that he would\"like to wait\" until the $2000 range before they split again,I am being covered in emails that claim they will spliteither Monday after the close or sometime during this week.I have never had the volume of email on a split rumor thatI had on MSFT this week. I own MSFT currently and wouldreally be a happy trader if this comes to pass.Watch the news Sunday for signs of the Brazilian flu andplan your trades accordingly for Monday.Good LuckJim BrownEditor***JIM'S PLAYSThe week started out great with Microsoft blowing away earningsand gapping open the next day. I had broken a cardinal rule andheld over in anticipation of a split and got the earnings gapas a surprise. THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA!!! I was forced to holdsome SUNW over earnings as the market was dropping too fastand my limit orders never filled. Ouch! Fortunately Sun didnot do the IBM thing and actually traded up on Friday. If wecan get a Nasdaq rally Monday I might be able to get out ofthe position alive. Other than the those two major tradesearly in the week I did almost nothing. Friday I bought thedip on faith and still feel pretty good about it. Now ifonly Brazil does not blow up over the weekend.Stock tradesSold 5000 KMAG @ $14.69 cost 13.56   Profit $5,650Sold 5000 SRCM @ $222.25 cost 222.75   Loss   -2,5000Sold 4000 PAIR @ $10.50 cost 10.50   Even   0   Total   +3,150Option tradesSold (10)   OEX-FEB-630 CALLS OEY-BF @14.25 cost 13.000 + 1,250Sold (25) MSFT-FEB-150 CALLS MSQ-BJ @18.888 cost 12.000 +17,2000Sold (1000)SUNW-FEB-1000 CALLS SUQ-BT @ 8.94 cost   8.19 + 7,5000Sold (4)   OEX-FEB-610 CALLS OEY-BB @30.000 cost 25.000 + 2,000Sold (4)   OEX-FEB-625 PUTS   OEY-NE @24.06 cost 17.25 + 2,724Sold (25) VOLVY-FEB-30 CALLS VQY-BF @ 2.75 cost   3.06 -   7775   Total   +29,8999Bond SpreadSold   (10)MAR-129 calls, Sold   (10)MAR-125 putsBought (10)MAR-131 calls, Bought (10)MAR-123 putsNet credit 45 points or $703 per contract   $7,030   Total all trades +$40,079This looks like a pretty good week but what you don't seeis the large loss I am currently holding in SUNW.

But what about Drug andHealthcare? These sectors have been trading higher and shouldfollow the Technology sector into new territory, right?   Wrong.Pinnacle turned Bearish on these sectors this weekend over thenear-term after violating key benchmarks of (DRG /740) and (HCX/ 720), respectively.More problematic is the Russell 2,000 (RUT).

This level ofexpectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and isrepresented by our Pinnacle Index figure.   The average PinnacleIndex is 2.0.   Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0reveals a high level of pessimism.   For aggressive options traders,we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levelsbelow.For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectationreporting this week is Realnetworks (RNWK) and Baker Hughes (BHI)with a Pinnacle Index of 12.2 and 1.0, respectively.   Thissuggests that if Real Networks does not beat their estimate onTuesday, they are likely to sell-off.   Conversely, if BakerHughes beats their estimate or reports any favorable news, theyare likely to move higher.Reporting   Estimated   PinnacleDate   Company   EPS   IndexGreat Expectations:1/26 RNWK   REALNETWORKS   -0.04   12.21/26 CYCH   CYBERCASH INC   -0.41   111.31/26 USWB   USWEB   0.05   10.01/28 VRTS   VERITAS SOFTWRE   0.21   9.91/27 MACR   MACROMEDIA INC   0.10   9.81/27 AMGN   AMGEN INC   0.84   9.41/27 IFMX   INFORMIX CORP   0.111   9.111/28 SEBL   SIEBEL SYSTEMS   0.15   8.71/27 CPQ   COMPAQ COMPUTER   0.36   8.31/27 SGP   SCHERING PLOUGH   0.28   7.51/26 AHP   AMER HOME PRODS   0.444   7.111/25 AXP   AMER EXPRESS CO   1.16   6.81/26 XRX   XEROX CORP   1.67   6.61/26 JNJ   JOHNSON &amp; JOHNS   0.51   6.51/25 T   AT&amp;T CORP   1.000   6.31/25 BLS   BELL SOUTH   0.41   6.21/26 EMC   EMC CORP   0.46   6.21/25 HAL   HALLIBURTON CO   0.27   6.21/25 TLAB   TELLABS INC   0.59   6.111/26 NT   NORTHERN TELECO   0.71   6.01/26 MRK   MERCK &amp; CO INC   1.16   5.61/28 GTE   GTE CORP   0.87   5.111/28 SHVA   SHIVA CORP   0.01   4.0Low Expectations:1/26 BHI   BAKER-HUGHES   0.17   1.01/27 SEEK   INFOSEEK CORP   -0.42   1.111/26 AMZN   AMAZON.COM INC   -0.19   1.111/27 DIS   DISNEY WALT   0.25   1.41/26 CY   CYPRESS SEMI   -0.01   1.61/28 LLY   LILLY ELI &amp; CO   0.51   1.81/27 BA   BOEING CO   0.42   1.9The Power of Sentiment AnalysisLast October (19998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors trackedcorporate earnings reports and advised subscribers aboutthe impact that excessive optimism and pessimism can haveon the stocks's performance following the release of itsquarterly earnings report.   If you recall, we identifiedseveral stocks that reached excessive sentiment levelsincluding Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).Reporting   Estimated   PinnacleDate   Company   EPS   IndexExcessive Optimism:10/13 INTL   Intel   .79   5.210/13 JNJ   Johnson &amp; Johnson   .70   3.710/15 AAPL   Apple Computer   .49   3.6Excessive Pessimism:10/13 JPM   JP Morgan   1.08   .410/12 C   Chrysler   .87   .710/14 PFE   Pfizer   .57   .910/13 GM   General Motors   .98-   1.210/16 G   Gillette   .30   1.310/14 MER   Merrill Lynch   .56   1.5The first is Intel (INTC).   The semiconductor powerhouse hadrallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) andclosed at $83.888.   What's interesting is that they beat thestreet's estimate by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped downthe next morning (10/14).   And despite the 3330 point Dow ratecut rally on Thursday (10/15), the stock had trouble takingout its recent previous high of $85.888.   Here, our sentimentanalysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gottenahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock hadtrouble advancing.We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).   This bluechip Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% fromits summer high ($120) to close at $95.50 before its releaseTuesday night (10/13).   Here, Pfizer actually missed itsestimated earnings by a nickel.   Although the stock initiallygapped down the next morning, it quickly rallied and closedhigher. Our message: it's all about understanding andmanaging expectations.Pinnacle IndexWhat is the Pinnacle Index.   It is simply the put/call ratioat key overhigh benchmark levels.   Typically, there should betwo (2) calls for every one (1) put.   So when this ratioreaches extremes levels, it can presage key turning points inthe stock.   The average Pinnacle Index, therefore, should read 2.0.One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.comfrom any other advisory services is our sentiment indicatoror Pinnacle Index.   The Pinnacle Index is designed to measurethe level of overhead resistance at key overhead benchmarklevels. This analysis can give savvy option traders a jump onother traders.It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like manysentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.   This meansthat the stock can and will go higher or lower despite whatour sentiment indicators might suggest.   However, ourexperience has shown that the market is subject to aprecipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extremelevels.Coming Events***Monday:Existing Home Sls Dec   Forecast: 4.85M   Previous: 4.90MTuesday:LJR Redbook   1/23   Forecast:   ---   Previous:   1.9%BTM/Schroeders   1/23   Forecast:   ---   Previous:   0.3%API Oil Stocks   1/23   Forecast:   ---   Previous: 321.9MWednesday:NoneThursday:Jobless Claims   1/23   Forecast:   ---   Previous: 346KDurable Goods   Dec   Forecast:   0.4%   Previous: 1.0%Employment Cost   Q4   Forecast:   0.9%   Previous: 1.0%Friday:GDP   Q4   Forecast:   4.0%   Previous: 3.7%CPMI   Jan   Forecast:   ---   Previous: 50.9Michigan Cons Sent Jan   Forecast:   ---   Previous: 1000.5HOW TO SUBSCRIBE***We would like to have you as a subscriber.

It is part of Murphy's Law.Just because we drop a stock as a pick does not mean we areadvocating a \"sell\" on any position you have. We are simplydropping our recommendation as a new play. Existing playscan and do continue on and are usually profitable.CALLS:JBL $70.000 (-3.888) JBL closed under its 30 day moving averageon Friday.   Its chart has flattened out and it looks like ithas lost all momentum.   JBL has had a nice run since October,but we are going to have to drop them as a pick.MYG $63.63 (-0.62)   It is time to say good-bye to ourgood 'ole friend Maytag.   For the past two weeks, MYG hasstruggled in the weakened market.   It sure would have beennice if Maytag had managed to keep its incredible streak alive.But, the -143.41 drop in the market on Friday snuffed out anychance of MYG rallying.   For the first time in eightweeks it finished with a net negative.   Even though Maytagannounces earnings on Feb 4th and the possibility of a splitremains, we feel that Maytag has lost some of its steam.   Weare dropping it as a pick for the time being.TLAB $79.63 (-6.31) Ciena, the flea, puts Tellabs in thedoghouse.   Seems like every time we get a good play onTellabs, rumors circulate that Ciena is again inacquisition talks with them.   Ciena goes up $4 on the rumorwhile TLAB pays the $4 penalty.   TLAB is still a greatcompany, but until the Ciena rumor goes away or the marketdecides it likes the idea of a merger, we can't recommend aplay.   Thus we are dropping TLAB for now.COF $128.69 (-1.75) We are dropping COF this week.   COF hada sub-par week and just hasn't been performing like we wouldexpect it to.   Providian Financial has performed much betterand is COF's key competitor.   It is likely most of the damageis sector related.   The banks are always weak whenever thereis economic worries overseas.   COF suffers with them despitethe fact that they have virtually no overseas exposure.   COFdid announced earnings that were right on estimates.ETH $48.000 (-.94) We are dropping ETH in favor of some quickermoving plays.   ETH has had a strong run, but has turned downnow for three straight days.   ETH had a nice earnings push andwas able to get as high as $50.75 on the 19th, but since thenhas tapered off.   ETH CEO did mention that there is a lot ofpent up demand for their products and when this comes tofruition, we might see a move to the upside.   Of course thiscould just be a consolidation after the strong move.FTL $17.81 (+1.13) While the possibility of a takeover isstill there, FTL has hit a ceiling in it's enthusiasm.For the last couple of weeks it's been trading sideways.We feel it may be stuck in a holding pattern while waitingon news of an offer.   If you are still interested in playingyou might consider the May options thus giving yourselfmore time.   However, if volume is any indication, currentmonth Febuarys have been popular.   Monday mornings havebecome the popular time to announce news of mergers andbuyouts.   Something could be brewing for the Jan. 25th.F $60.888 (-1.13) After a 10% rise in operating profits,a 1000% increase in their cost cutting success, and their111th consecutive quarter of beating the street's estimatesand their stock drops almost 4 points.   It is quite likelythat the Dow's 215 drop Thursday/Friday was a catalystfor the decline but we expected better from this automaker.CCU $59.06 (-1.37) Dropping 2 days in a row after settinga new 52 week high, CCU has succumbed to profit takers.We understand the need for consolidation and pullbacksafter a strong run, but breaking through it's 10 dma isnot a good sign.   Depending on how the market performsnext week, we will either see a large bounce back upthrough its 10 dma or a continued slide.   Increasedinterest in competitor AMFM's merger or acquisitionactivity may drive interest back into this sector butwe are cautious and willing to trade this play for astronger one.   Nimble traders should watch foropportunities.   This stock is prone to strong 3-5-7day cycle trading.PUTS:Eastman Kodak (EK) - $65.50 .25   (-3.50)Big winner for OI subscribers after stock gave up more than$15 over the past two weeks.

Their goal is to allowpeople to access or transfer information without regard todifferences in time, place or type of computer systems,voice or data.   About 85% of the routers used to decipherand direct data traffic on the Internet are made by Cisco.CSCO will gain tremendously from the AT&amp;T/TCI merger sincethey will build the equipment needed to harness the massappeal of broadband services.   Similarly, in an agreementsigned this week, Cisco will provide technology to DaxianElectronics so that Daxian can build cable modems under theCisco brand to develop cable broadband services in China.China already serves 1000 million cable customers, just 10%of the market.   Wow!   What potential to connect Chinesecitizens with local and long distance phone service,Internet, data services, video conferencing, etc.   CSCOwill earn royalties from the transaction too.   Also, areminder from a Reuters news release, Cisco continues togrow 35% per year while the market grows 15%.   CSCO istruly leading the development of the Internet by helpingcable and phone companies complete \"the last mile\", or thedistance between the cable in the street an your home.With as volatile a week as we had on NASDAQ, CSCO held upwell.   It is time we watch for CSCO's earnings run.   Plus,the network giant is once again a split candidate.   Theyare due to announce earnings after the close on February 2ndwhere we expect them to announce a split.   It's unusual thatthey would split so soon after their 3:2 in September.Historically though, CSCO splits in the $80-1000 range andthey have enough shares authorized to give us another 3:2.Greet price dips as a buying opportunity, confirm marketdirection and use stops.   Day trading CSCO can usually earnyou 5-10% on any given trading day (if you pick the rightoption), but you have to watch it and use limit orders (targetshooting works too).   If you do, at least be disciplined.BUY CALL FEB-1000 CYQ-BT OI= 97773 at $8.63 SL=6.50BUY CALL FEB-105*CYQ-BA OI=14047 at $6.000 SL=4.25BUY CALL FEB-1110 CYQ-BB OI=12486 at $3.888 SL=2.50BUY CALL APR-1110 CYQ-DB OI= 4189 at $8.13 SL=6.25LEAPS:BUY LEAP JAN-2000-1110 LCY-AB at $21.38 SL=16.75BUY LEAP JAN-20001-1110 ZCY-AB at $30.75 SL=24.000Picked on Oct   8th   $46.69   PE= 108Change since picked   +$56.12   52 week low =$37.25Analysts Ratings   17-13-1-0-0   52 week high=$109.93Last earnings on 111-04 est=.333   actual=.34Next earnings on 02-02 est=.36   versus=.29Chart = http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=csco&amp;amp;d=3mInternet***AOL - America Online $140.444 (-6.06)(+0.000)(-8.63)(P6W +83.56)America Online is the largest online Internet accesservice in the world.   Membership now exceeds 15 millionusers.   Its Chairman, Steve Case, said more new userssigned up with AOL on Christmas Day than any other day inthe company's history.   With estimates of 16 million usersby the year 2000 and growing advertising revenues AOL hasbeen called the blue chip of the Internets. (If only theycould get their mail problem resolved!)A case of throwing the baby out with the bath water.Almost every analyst we hear from regarding the \"longoverdue\" sell-off of Internet stocks qualifies it with,\"But AOL is the exception\".   This was not a good weekoverall for the internets; tough on AOL too, though theyshowed good strength in adding back $5 from their $135 opening on Friday morning.   Frankly, we struggle at timesplaying AOL during it's consolidation phase.   We still thinkthat with earnings just 3 trading days away, with theexpectation of a split announcement, buyers will step in toraise the price and give us a healthy run-up.   AOL reports23,000 new customers logging on daily, and over $1 billionsales through its site for the Christmas season.   Weekly,they add new advertisers paying dearly for the exclusiveprivilege of appearing on AOL.   Ever notice those companiesdon't report how much it costs them?   It's a lot and weexpect it to be nicely reflected in an earnings surprise.AOL is well over historic split territory, usually $120-$130.   They have enough authorized share to give a 3:1, but2:1 is more likely. Earning are expected after 5:000 p.m.ET, Wednesday, January 27.   Given the recent poundingstocks take after announcing great earnings, we stronglycaution all traders to re-analyze their risk to hold overan earnings announcement.   Just because we expect greatnumbers and a split doesn't mean that their earnings won'tturn sour or that a split may fail to materialize.   Confirmmarket direction and use stops.

Now the newlyformed giant of giants is duking it out with AT&amp;T as theystake their claim in the local phone service, internationalservice, cellular, paging, and Internet access arenas.WorldCom's $37 billion purchase of MCI last Septemberqualifies it the 7th largest merger or acquisition in 19998.WCOM is one of the largest Internet backbone providers inthe world.   If you're reading this letter, somewhere in thetransmission, WCOM fiber brought it to you.WCOM, the 5th largest component of the NASDAQ 1000, was downslightly on the week, which we think is good news given theBrazil/China/Greenspan jitters.   Buyers stepped in withheavy volume of 111-18 million shares daily to offer supportin the $73 range.   Average daily volume is 10.7 millionshares.   Technical indicators are not looking so greatright now, except for the strong bounce off Thursday's low.Resistance is $80.   Market permitting, we expect the bounceto continue and look for nice profits as WCOM tests $80again.   If it breaks $80 with good volume, the sky is thelimit.Noteworthy this week, UUNET, the ISP (Internet serviceprovider) division of WCOM announced they would be theservice provider for Gateway Computer customer's Internetservice.   Gateway said it chose UUNET because it was thefirst company to offer commercial access to the Internet,and it continues to maintain the industry's most reliable,rigorously managed and most widely deployed network(Reuters).

Through growth and acquisition,they now provide data transmission, video tele-conferencing, PCS/wireless/cellular, Internet, paging andlocal phone services via microwave, fiber and copperinfrastructure throughout the U.S. and internationalmarkets.   Their annual revenues in excess of $555 billiondwarf their nearest competitor, MCIWorldCom, by 5 times.Their 19998 acquisition of TCG (formerly TeleportCommunications Group, the nations largest competitive localexchange carrier) and IBM's data services division will addsubstantially to their revenues.   Pending a merger withcable giant, TCI, revenues could grow even more.   MichaelArmstrong, AT&amp;T's CEO, has investors believing that AT&amp;T isno longer a copper wire dinosaur heading-up the telecomextinction list.This is an earnings and momentum play.   Up $4.000 on a downweek, T is behaving more like a tech stock with $6 dailyswings.   Technicals look great and will look even betterwhen the market shakes off its jitters.   T traded as highas $96 inter-day Wednesday to give us tremendous profits.We hope you protected them from the backslide using stoploss orders.   Given AT&amp;T's turnaround with MichaelArmstrong at the helm, we think AT&amp;T will show excellentearnings and revenue growth.   There is some confusion withearnings announcement date shown as January 26 by Zack's.This is most likely inaccurate.   First Call lists no reportdate.   AT&amp;T shareholder relations says, \"between February23-25\".   We'll report it to you when AT&amp;T clarifies thepictures.   In the meantime, with AT&amp;T's current strength,dips should be met as a buying opportunity.Some great news: AT&amp;T may sell it's WorldNet ISP divisionto @Home for $1 billion in @Home stock.   At Home would thenfold WorldNet's 1.3 million subscribers into its customerbase of 3330,000, with the goal of converting the AT&amp;T usersto its much faster, cable-based service.   AT&amp;T, however,essentially would retain control of it's online servicebecause it's about to acquire voting control over At Homewith its pending $41 billion purchase of the second largestU.S. cable TV operator, Tele-Communications Inc.   TCI ownsa 58 percent voting stake in At Home and 28 percent of itscommon shares (CBSMarketwatch).   With @Home buying Excite,AT&amp;T would then have the content to compete with the likesof AOL.For those new to our publication (veterans, please forgiveus), three weeks ago, AT&amp;T got the green light to mergewith TCI thus creating a huge bandwidth pipe (lots oftransmission capacity) over \"the last Mile\" or that shortdistance between the street and your phone jack.   It'sestimated that it costs $12000 per home for a typicalutility to trench and install any transmission equipment.That's why even though the fiber optic cable runs down yourstreet, you can't yet access it.   It's too expensive to getit to you.   Soon, you'll be able to bypass that fiber infavor of AT&amp;T/TCI cable.   It's already there.

It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales aregrowing rapidly, and margins are higher as well.We dropped Nokia on Jan. 10th as it began a correction andpicked it up again in last Sunday's letter.   It rewarded uswith a 16.81 jump in price by mid-day Wednesday, beforelosing two thirds of that to market weakness the rest of theweek.   Nokia was still up $5.94 on the week.   Theentire telecommunications industry is very strong now, asinvestors realize that it is one of the sectors with the mostexciting growth prospects.   As one of the premier companies inthat sector, Nokia is especially strong.   It continues toannounce new contracts to supply its cutting edge products tocompanies throughout the world, and plans to doubleproduction at one of it's German plants to meet demand.We are recommending Nokia as a momentum play and also as asplit candidate.   It's last split announcement was followed bea long, powerful rise in the stock price. Earnings will beannounced before the bell on Friday, January 29th. Although webelieve that a split announcement is likely, remember whathappened to several other stocks that either did not beatestimates by a wide enough margin, or did not announce theexpected split.   There is opportunity to play Nokia before theearnings are released. You could pick them up again Fridaymorning if the company announces a split, and the earningsare as strong as we expect.

It then bouncednicely off of its 10 day moving average on Friday.   Since lateNovember, ORCL has been getting a little ahead of its 10 daymoving average, then pulling back to it, all in a nice upwardtrend.   Last week this movement was a little exaggerated withIBM announcement, but ORCL might be a good candidate for sometarget shooting around its 10 dma.In the news last week, ORCL announced that it is teaming upwith IBM to offer its software on IBM hardware.   The offeringwill be targeted at manufacturers and will be availablesometime during the 1st quarter.

Revenuesfor MU declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCsand semi-conductor products. This was a result of too muchproduct industry wide and too little demand, but the companyis recovering now, as demand increases.An overabundance of chips sent prices down from $2000 a yearago to below $60 in May, but they have recovered to near $90now, as the surplus has dried up. A decreasing supply ispartly the cause. The Koreans, for instance, have beencutting production. But the demand for chips is alsoincreasing because sales of PCs are on the rise.

Thecompany's products store retrieve, manage, protect and shareinformation from all major computing environments, includingUNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.   EMC markets itsmemory products under the name Symmetrix.   EMC and itsenterprise storage systems have developed a clear cuttechnological edge over its competition.   The company has beenable to successfully leverage its leadership position in themainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing opensystems market.In the news last week, Staples, the world's largest operator ofoffice superstores, announced that they have standardized theirdata storage needs on an EMC system.   The reasons they gavewere to more effectively manage rapid business growth, reduceinformation management costs, and improve customer service.Also, there was an interesting article at MSN MoneyCentralcomparing EMC and its rival NTAP.   An observation by thearticle was that every bit of new e-mail, every sale over theInternet, and every extra page view increases the need to buildmore storage into the Internet.   It also pointed out that EMChas just begun selling software to its customer base.   Softwaresales are expected to grow from $4000 million in 19998 to $1billion by 20001.Last week was EMC's first losing week in the last 5 weeks.Then again, the techs were under some heavy selling pressurelast week.   EMC set a new 52 week high on Wednesday, and thentraded down.   There was a scary gap down at the open on Friday,but EMC recovered nicely.   EMC reports earnings before theopen on 1/26, and as we indicated last week, we don't believethere will be a split announcement with earnings.

Sun had actually attempted to shrugoff all of the profit takers and reached $1000.25 in intradaytrading on Friday.   But, it then lost those gains and closeddown -$0.25.   Maybe the unstable market contributed to thedrop.   Maybe it had to do with BancBoston Robertson Stephensdowngrading the stock stating a drop-off in bookings, backlogs,more competition, and revenue reports that weren't up to parwith their expectations.

With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,\rand its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from\rcustomers among the telephone companies, cable operators,\rand government agencies.   Though they faded from news of\rtheir failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major\rplayer.\r Wow!   What a play.   TLAB gave up only $0.444 in Thursday's\rturmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at\r$85.94.   Technicals look outstanding with a small\rconsolidation already taken place; all indicators in\rpositive territory.   We introduced the play Thursday under\rthe following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78\ron 111 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously\rset at $70.   TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to\r$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.   Over the previous 3\rtrading days, it gained in market weakness while giving\rback only $.444 in heavy trading in a downright bearish\rmarket - a terrific sign of strength.   3.5 million shares\rtraded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share\rin cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.   We\rexpect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.\rRecent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a\rgood story.   We could find no news on Friday driving the\rprice; just market recovery and stock momentum.\r Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a\r\"buy\" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35\rand $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,\rrespectively.   They further state, \"fundamentals for the\rtelecom equipment group has improved over the past few\rmonths which improves visibility for Tellabs\" and \"Our\rchecks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 19998 results\rslightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,\ras well as having a positive outlook for 1999\" (Reuters).\rAlso, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted\rbuyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.

As\ryou know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but\rQCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the\rearnings release.   Depending on the earnings release on\rTuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given\rthe merger activity in the sector.   After the earnings release,\rwait for a direction before initiating a play.\r BUY CALL FEB-60 QAQ-BL OI=3D1421 at $7.25 SL=3D5.25\rBUY CALL FEB-65*QAQ-BM OI=3D12224 at $4.38 SL=3D2.75\rBUY CALL FEB-70 QAQ-BN OI=3D 745 at $2.50 SL=3D1.25\rBUY CALL APR-70 QAQ-DN OI=3D 401 at $5.13 SL=3D3.25\rBUY CALL JUL-70 QAQ-GN OI=3D   37 at $7.888 SL=3D6.25\r Picked on Jan 17th at $63.888   PE=3D222\rChange since picked   +0.000   52 week low =3D$37.75\rAnalysts Ratings   6-8-6-0-0   52 week high=3D$67.38\rLast earnings   09-98 est=3D.50   actual=3D.54\rNext earnings   01-19 est=3D.59   versus=3D.58\rChart =3D http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=3DQCOM&amp;amp;d=3D3m\r***\rNOK.A   Nokia   $138.59 (+$3.59)\r Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and\requipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular\rphones.

When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on\rJan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to\rrecommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's\r$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the\rstock remains well above its moving averages, so we are\radding it back to our recommended plays.

With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,\rand its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from\rcustomers among the telephone companies, cable operators,\rand government agencies.   Though they faded from news of\rtheir failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major\rplayer.\r Wow!   What a play.   TLAB gave up only $0.444 in Thursday's\rturmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at\r$85.94.   Technicals look outstanding with a small\rconsolidation already taken place; all indicators in\rpositive territory.   We introduced the play Thursday under\rthe following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78\ron 111 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously\rset at $70.   TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to\r$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.   Over the previous 3\rtrading days, it gained in market weakness while giving\rback only $.444 in heavy trading in a downright bearish\rmarket - a terrific sign of strength.   3.5 million shares\rtraded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share\rin cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.   We\rexpect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.\rRecent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a\rgood story.   We could find no news on Friday driving the\rprice; just market recovery and stock momentum.\r Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a\r\"buy\" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35\rand $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,\rrespectively.   They further state, \"fundamentals for the\rtelecom equipment group has improved over the past few\rmonths which improves visibility for Tellabs\" and \"Our\rchecks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 19998 results\rslightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,\ras well as having a positive outlook for 1999\" (Reuters).\rAlso, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted\rbuyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.   Not\rsoon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the\rprice move.\r BUY CALL FEB-80 TEQ-BP OI=3D1270 at $ 9.75 SL=3D 7.25 ATM\rBUY CALL FEB-85*TEQ-BQ OI=3D 965 at $ 7.000 SL=3D 5.75 OTM\rBUY CALL MAR-85 TEQ-CQ OI=3D 873 at $ 9.38 SL=3D 7.000 more time\rBUY CALL JUN-85 TEQ-FQ OI=3D 105 at $13.75 SL=3D111.000 OTM\rhighest strike available\r Picked on Jan. 14th   $80.69   PE=3D 39\rChange since picked   $ 5.25   52 week low =3D$31.38\rAnalysts Ratings   15-9-3-0-0   52 week high=3D$93.12\rLast earnings on 09-98 est=3D.46   actual=3D.49\rNext earnings on 01-25 est=3D.59   versus=3D.42\rChart =3D http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=3DTLAB&amp;amp;d=3D3m\r***\rQCOM - Qualcomm, Inc. $63.888 (+3.63)\r QCOM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and operates\radvanced communications systems and products based on digital\rwireless technology. The Company's primary product areas are\rthe OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based,\rmobile communications system providing two-way data and\rposition reporting services), CDMA wireless communications\rsystems and products and, in conjunction with others, the\rdevelopment of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO)\rsatellite communications system.   The company's CDMA technology\rhas become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the\rUS and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other\rcountries.   Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US\rwireless industry is migrating from analog to digital.\r In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other\rcompanies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line\rtelephone service in Brazil.   QCOM has indicated, in the past,\rthat it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.   Since\r19990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in\rChina has been about 160%, according to government figures.\rQCOM is building a global presence.   It was also reported on\rCNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a\rtakeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the\rLU/ASND merger.   If fact, the entire sector is expecting\ranother round of takeovers given the competitive landscape.\r QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.   It\ractually fell below its 2000 day moving average in December, and\rthen started its current run around the beginning of the year.\rQCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.   As\ryou know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but\rQCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the\rearnings release.   Depending on the earnings release on\rTuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given\rthe merger activity in the sector.   After the earnings release,\rwait for a direction before initiating a play.\r BUY CALL FEB-60 QAQ-BL OI=3D1421 at $7.25 SL=3D5.25\rBUY CALL FEB-65*QAQ-BM OI=3D12224 at $4.38 SL=3D2.75\rBUY CALL FEB-70 QAQ-BN OI=3D 745 at $2.50 SL=3D1.25\rBUY CALL APR-70 QAQ-DN OI=3D 401 at $5.13 SL=3D3.25\rBUY CALL JUL-70 QAQ-GN OI=3D   37 at $7.888 SL=3D6.25\r Picked on Jan 17th at $63.888   PE=3D222\rChange since picked   +0.000   52 week low =3D$37.75\rAnalysts Ratings   6-8-6-0-0   52 week high=3D$67.38\rLast earnings   09-98 est=3D.50   actual=3D.54\rNext earnings   01-19 est=3D.59   versus=3D.58\rChart =3D http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=3DQCOM&amp;amp;d=3D3m\r***\rNOK.A   Nokia   $138.59 (+$3.59)\r Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and\requipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular\rphones.

Nokia is\rincreasing plant capacity to keep up with demand.\r We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a\rsplit candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily\rfor us into the first week of January, when the stock got\rahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to\renthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI\rbids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on\rJan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to\rrecommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's\r$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the\rstock remains well above its moving averages, so we are\radding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA\rannounced a split in Feb. 19998, a long and steep split run\rfollowed. We have been unable to confirm the expected\rearnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we\rwill keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new\rsplit announcement.\r Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile\rphone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of\rMiami.

The line to\rtake their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and\rdistinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.\rThey are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or\rnot!) and their operating systems dominate the PC\rlandscape.\r Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous\rweek.   Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above\raverage volume for 4 of 5 trading days.   Friday gave us an\r$8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.

Sales are expected\rto increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.   With conviction,\rwe still predict a stock split with the earnings\rannouncement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed\rthis date); only 1 trading day away.   Historically, MSFT\rhas split like clockwork at $140.   MSFT has expressed\roptimism about their future and has every reason to split\rthe stock.   MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high\rof $152.50, set the previous week.   Prudential last week\rset a price target of $175.   We think their relative price\rcompared to the market reflects strong investor confidence.\rA great play in the making.\r Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge\rscolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language\rrequiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a\rpending lawsuit over the software giant's employment\rpractices (Reuters).   It had no affect on the stock, but\rraised eyebrows in the PR department.   Conversely, a new\rMicrosoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers\rbelieve that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers\rand the computer software industry (Reuters).   The real\rsurprise was another press release stating Robert Bork\rbelieves Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an\runusual comment from a free market champion, until you\rrealize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the\rJustice Departments case.   Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun-\rJava infringement injunction citing that it believes the\rcourt mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun\ras a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.

This was confirmed by the move EMC\rmade on Friday.   We continue to read   articles that discuss EMC\rbeing in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.   There was\ran article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top\r30 growth stocks.   EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a\rgreat momentum stock.\r EMC took off again on Friday.   It set a new 52 week high on\rFriday, and closed near the high.   As we discussed above, EMC\ris one of those stocks that people keep buying.   As long as\rthere are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with\rit's momentum.   EMC is also a split candidate.   We know we keep\rsaying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases\rthe probability of a split.   A year ago this last November EMC\rsplit at around $63 after a strong move.   FYI - EMC reports\rearnings before the open on 1/26.\r BUY CALL FEB- 95 EMC-BS OI=3D1072   at $10.75 SL=3D 8.50\rBUY CALL FEB-1000*EMC-BT OI=3D35111   at $ 8.25 SL=3D 6.25\rBUY CALL APR- 95 EMC-DS OI=3D 540   at $15.50 SL=3D111.75\rBUY CALL APR-1000 EMC-DT OI=3D2619   at $12.888 SL=3D10.50\r Picked on Nov 8th at $69.06   PE=3D58\rChange since picked   +31.000   52 week low =3D$ 23.50\rAnalysts Ratings 10-4-0-0-0   52 week high=3D$1000.19\rLast earnings   9-98 est=3D.36   actual=3D.38\rNext earnings   1-26 est=3D.46   versus=3D.32\rChart =3D http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=3DEMC&amp;amp;d=3D3m\r***\rXIRC   Xircom Inc. $39.888 (+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)\r Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate\rnetworks, the Internet, and commercial online services.

Last week, we offered\ra position on Reliance Bancorp (RELY) and it turns out that the\roption quoted was for another stock. It was not a research error\ror miss-type, just erroneous quote information provided to the\rtrading public. One of our faithful readers had the unfortunate\rexperience of buying into this play on the assumption that the\roption existed. We received permission to reprint portions of his\rremarks to educate our readers. Here is the general narrative;\r \"I did my 'due diligence' on the options play with Reliance\rBancorp but like a growing number of people this was all handled\ron-line with me as the only human in the food chain willing to\rtake any chances. Oddly though, I did speak to two other people\rin this and got an interesting mix of answers.\r I used (two common brokerages; names deleted) for my information,\rperhaps using two separate entities was my downfall here. One\rstated just as you did that there was a Reliance, FEB25-Call at\rthe same bid as you published. If fact, it showed an array of\roptions for Reliance. However, come to find out they were Verio.\r I then bought shares of Reliance on-line through another broker in\rmy IRA with the intention of selling calls against them the next\rday. When I entered the ticker symbol to 'sell calls to open', I\rwas greeted by a statement about Verio. Calling the broker, I was\rtold that the ticker symbol was in fact for Verio but only the Feb.\rcall. I then contacted the option trading desk and found that the\rticker symbol belonged to Verio and there were no options on RELY\rat all. I was fooled by the apparent presence of options at one\rbrokerage, which tells me that I need to do all my research\rthrough the top name brokerage.\"\r The reader went on to point out that; \"It turned out to be the\rsystems that were fouled up and not the analysis, all information\rthat is received on-line or through humans should be verified\rbefore investing...I sure plan to do so from now on!\"\r Words of wisdom for sure!\r ***\rSUMMARY OF PREVIOUS PICKS:\r***\r Stock   Price   Last   Mon   Strike   Opt   Profit   ROI   Monthly\rSym   Picked Price   Price   Bid   /Loss   ROI\r DOSE   4.06   7.06   Jan   5.000   0.50   *$   1.444   40.4%   29.3%\rITVU   17.69   24.50   Jan   15.000   3.25   *$   0.56   3.9%   16.9%\rAPLX   4.94   5.000   Jan   5.000   0.63   $   0.69   16.0%   13.9%\rMCHM   8.444   8.63   Jan   7.50   1.38   *$   0.444   6.2%   13.5%\rDBCC   17.81   21.75   Jan   15.000   3.63   *$   0.82   5.8%   12.6%\rMCHM   8.25   8.63   Jan   7.50   1.63   *$   0.888   13.3%   111.6%\rCYCH   20.69   19.75   Jan   17.50   3.63   *$   0.444   2.6%   111.2%\rFILE   10.38   111.50   Jan   10.000   1.444   *$   1.06   111.9%   10.3%\rNTKI   15.75   15.444   Jan   12.50   4.000   *$   0.75   6.4%   9.2%\rCYCH   15.000   19.75   Jan   12.50   3.000   *$   0.50   4.2%   9.1%\rNOVT   24.06   25.444   Jan   222.50   2.888   *$   1.32   6.2%   9.0%\rWAVO   9.38   9.38   Jan   7.50   2.31   *$   0.43   6.1%   8.8%\rSPYG   20.888   18.13   Jan   17.50   4.38   *$   1.000   6.1%   8.8%\rBMP   24.56   24.25   Jan   20.000   6.000   *$   1.444   7.8%   8.4%\rITVU   13.25   24.50   Jan   10.000   4.13   *$   0.888   9.6%   8.4%\rEGGS   20.888   23.25   Jan   17.50   4.000   *$   0.62   3.7%   8.0%\rSYBS   7.81   8.28   Jan   7.50   0.94   *$   0.63   9.2%   8.0%\rVRTY   222.50   35.06   Jan   20.000   4.13   *$   1.63   8.9%   7.7%\rHDL   12.94   13.13   Jan   12.50   1.444   *$   1.000   8.7%   7.6%\rPPRT   13.888   13.13   Jan   12.50   2.25   *$   0.87   7.5%   6.5%\rEOG   16.94   16.81   Jan   15.000   2.75   *$   0.81   5.7%   6.2%\rPPOD   6.75   8.25   Jan   5.000   2.13   *$   0.38   8.2%   6.0%\rMANU   13.75   15.38   Jan   10.000   4.25   *$   0.50   5.3%   5.7%\rVIRS   12.75   14.13   Jan   10.000   3.25   *$   0.50   5.3%   5.7%\rVOLVY   23.75   27.75   Jan   20.000   4.75   *$   1.000   5.3%   5.7%\rDBCC   17.81   21.75   Jan   12.50   5.63   *$   0.32   2.6%   5.7%\rMICA   17.13   17.000   Jan   12.50   5.25   *$   0.62   5.2%   5.7%\rMWHS   28.38   43.50   Jan   25.000   5.13   *$   1.75   7.5%   5.5%\rVSVR   16.75   17.13   Jan   15.000   2.444   *$   0.69   4.8%   5.2%\rSDTI   18.31   27.50   Jan   15.000   4.13   *$   0.82   5.8%   5.0%\rPTVL   14.69   222.50   Jan   10.000   5.13   *$   0.444   4.6%   5.0%\rABTX   12.69   14.38   Jan   10.000   3.25   *$   0.56   5.9%   4.3%\rSER   6.38   6.13   Jan   5.000   1.63   *$   0.25   5.3%   3.8%\rCYLKE   4.31   3.81   Jan   5.000   0.50   $   0.000   0.0%   0.0%\rTERA   7.888   6.63   Jan   7.50   1.19   $ -0.06   -0.9%   0.0%\rIMNR   13.13   10.25   Jan   12.50   2.000   $ -0.888   -7.9%   0.0%\rTDFX   16.444   12.38   Jan   15.000   2.444   $ -1.62 -111.6%   0.0%\rPSCX   111.31   8.000   Jan   10.000   2.19   $ -1.12 -12.3%   0.0%\r---\rTOK   9.75   111.000   Feb   10.000   1.63   *$   1.888   23.2%   14.4%\rMCRE   5.38   7.63   Feb   5.000   1.25   *$   0.87   21.1%   13.1%\rARTT   7.38   8.000   Feb   7.50   1.13   *$   1.25   20.0%   12.4%\rBID   32.25   32.13   Feb   30.000   5.888   *$   3.63   13.8%   8.5%\rDOSE   6.50   7.06   Feb   5.000   2.000   *$   0.50   111.1%   8.0%\rSDTI   222.000   27.50   Feb   20.000   4.38   *$   2.38   13.5%   7.3%\rPPOD   6.81   8.25   Feb   5.000   2.31   *$   0.50   111.1%   6.9%\rABTE   8.75   9.50   Feb   7.50   1.888   *$   0.63   9.2%   6.6%\rGALTF   25.50   26.25   Feb   222.50   5.38   *$   2.38   111.8%   6.4%\rCHRX   21.38   21.25   Feb   20.000   3.13   *$   1.75   9.6%   6.0%\rNEWZ   111.63   13.000   Feb   10.000   2.444   *$   0.81   8.8%   5.5%\rBNYN   14.444   15.75   Feb   10.000   5.13   *$   0.69   7.4%   5.4%\rARTT   7.38   8.000   Feb   5.000   2.75   *$   0.37   8.0%   5.0%\rPTVL   222.19   222.50   Feb   15.000   8.13   *$   0.94   6.7%   4.8%\rPTVL   18.38   222.50   Feb   12.50   6.888   *$   1.000   8.7%   4.7%\rNSTA   26.25   24.000   Feb   25.000   4.13   $   1.888   8.5%   4.6%\rOXHP   20.06   18.888   Feb   17.50   3.38   *$   0.82   4.9%   3.6%\rOXHP   20.06   18.888   Feb   20.000   2.000   $   0.82   4.5%   3.3%\rSYMM   8.56   6.75   Feb   7.50   1.888   $   0.07   1.0%   0.8%\r -ROI is equal to the profit (or loss) divided by the cost-basis.\r Monthly ROI represents the return on a monthly basis.\r Example: a 10% return in 20 days equals 15.2% ROI for a month).\r-Margin is not used in any calculations.\r-Profit/Loss Column: Asterisk indicates stock price above strike\r price and should be called.

Dell has consistentlyoutperformed any other major stock for price performance.Dell is up +12000% in the last five years and has splittheir stock five times in the last three years, two timesin 19998 alone.   Dell is a low price, high margin producerbecause it has only 6 days of inventory and doesn't have topay its suppliers (some who manufacture in Asia) until 8days later. Since Dell gets paid before it manufactures abox, they have a huge cash float-can you say \"83% return onequity?\"   In late December, they announced a multi-yearmarketing deal with AOL to place AOL on all Dell desktops.In its server business, Dell managed a 62% year over yearsequential revenue growth.   With over 2000 product andservice awards earned during 19998, Dell has not forgottenits manufacturing and marketing prowessVeteran readers may recall our obituary to DELL written inOctober.   For those who missed it, \"It is not often we haveto write an obituary for a great play but for those of usstill in denial, Dell may be dead.   We still think Dell isa great company.   Great earnings, great sales, growing at+50%, opening new markets.   We think the problems aremany.\"   We assumed that the shares in float, now totalingabout 980 million (that's \"m\", not \"b\"), had split so manytimes, so as to dilute the stock's ability to have bigdaily run-ups or even bigger earnings per share surprises.We reasoned it now takes an additional $10 million ofearnings to create $.01 per share surprise.   Dell used tosurprise us by $.05 routinely-pretty hard now to hide $50million quarterly from Wall Street, especially for anearnings surprise.   In essence, Dell's ratio of dailyturnover compared to shares in float couldn't move theprice as much.   To add insult to injury, Dell reallyflattened out after its last split run to $69, where itfell back to languish in the $60-$666 range.   In earlyNovember, DELL spiked up   to $72 in anticipation of anotherearnings surprise but couldn't hold it after theannouncement.   So we dropped it despite its soundfundamentals.   Now, Dell's back.From their 10Q filed with the SEC December 14th, we gleanthe following: During the third quarter and first ninemonths of fiscal 1999, enterprise unit sales increased 1112%and 165%, respectively, compared to the third quarter andfirst nine months of fiscal 19998, and increasedsequentially 13% over the second quarter of fiscal 1999.Notebook unit sales increased 141% and 123% in the thirdquarter and first nine months of fiscal 1999, compared tothe same period of the prior fiscal year, and increasedsequentially 16% over the second quarter of fiscal 1999.Net revenue increased in all geographic regions in thethird quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 1999 ascompared to the same periods of fiscal 19998. Net revenuefor the third quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to the thirdquarter of fiscal 19998 increased 46% in the Americas, 68%in Europe and 49% in Asia-Pacific and Japan. Net revenuefor the first nine months of fiscal 1999 compared to thefirst nine months of fiscal 19998 increased 48% in theAmericas,67% in Europe and 39% in Asia-Pacific and Japan.Nowadays, this stuff barely makes the news.   We think theirprice would be higher if it did.Wednesday, Dell's volume swelled to over 27 million shares,well above its 19 million share average, raising the price$2.19 to an all-time closing high of $85.31.   If Dell canbreak this, its next resistance is $888.13, set in Wednesdayintra-day trading.   Thursday and Friday, Dell fared muchbetter than the overall NASDAQ giving back only $2.31 onlower than average volumes.   This shows investorunwillingness to part with the stock, though we could sureuse more high volume trading days.   As evidenced by Dell'stie for the #1 position in PCs and workstations, we canonly offer an educated guess that Dell contributedsignificantly to Microsoft's stellar earnings.   What's goodfor the goose is good for the gander, and we expect this tobe well-reflected in Dell's earnings too.   Heck, Gatewayimpressed the market with upside surprise earnings. So willDell as news of Dell's success's get more notice runninginto earnings, scheduled Tues., February 16, after theclose.It is not likely you'll hear this from the Wall StreetJournal, Baron's or CNBC.   So we'll spread the word.   WhileHewlett Packard still rules the NT space, price deflationis favoring direct seller Dell, which claimed 20% of the NTmarket in the September period, nearly double its previousshare (motley Fool).   Hewlett-Packard and Dell, which hadzero market share in the beginning of 19997, are in avirtual tie for first place in both units and revenue forthe personal workstation segment (Reuters).   That knockedCompaq out of the number two slot, as its market shareplunged from 34% to 17% (Motley Fool). Dell will integrate@Home's broadband Internet service experience with cable-ready and Dell Dimension desktop PCs (PRNewswire).   Dellwill be the first major computer vendor to offer themultiple award-winning Digital Flat Panel Solution Packfrom Number Nine Visual Technology. Thursday, theyannounced ImageWatch(SM), a program that provides earlynotification of technology changes to Dell corporate andinstitutional customers, available at no charge.Dip buying is warranted, but confirm upward market movement first.BUY CALL FEB-80 DLQ-BP OI=21404 at $7.50 SL=5.75BUY CALL FEB-85*DLQ-BQ OI=24060 at $4.888 SL=3.000BUY CALL FEB-90 DLQ-BR OI=18428 at $2.75 SL=1.50BUY CALL MAR-85 DLQ-CQ OI= 3152 at $7.38 SL=5.75BUY CALL MAR-90 DLQ-CR OI= 24448 at $5.50 SL=3.75Picked on Jan. 6th at $75.25   PE = 78Change since picked   +$ 7.75   52 week low =$23.12Analysts Ratings 12-9-10-0-0   52 week high=$888.12Last earnings 10/98 est= .27   actual=.28 surprise +3.7%Next earnings 02-16 est= .31   versus=.20Chart = http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=DELL&amp;amp;d=3m***Biotech   - Sector***AMGN - Amgen $1114.63 (+5.75)Founded in 1980, Amgen is a global biotechnology company thatdevelops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics basedon advances in cellular and molecular biology.   With sales of$2.34 billion, it is the largest of the biotech companies andis more than twice the size of its nearest rival.   Amgen'sproducts include the billion-dollar blockbusters Epogen (EPO)and Neupogen, as well as Infergen.   Epogen is used to treatanemia in patients with kidney failure or patients undergoingchemotherapy.   Neupogen is used to stimulate the immune systemand Infergen treats chronic hepatitis.   Many other drugs arein the pipeline, but the most important new drug is NESP---anext-generation drug to succeed EPO.On December 222, 19998, Amgen won a critical court ruling overJohnson and Johnson (JNJ), which gave AMGN exclusive rightsto NESP.   As a young, struggling company, Amgen had sold therights to Epogen (EPO) to JNJ, and JNJ claimed NESP, the newsuccessor to EPO, was just a revised version of the samedrug, and was covered under the EPO sales agreement.   EPO isone of the top selling drugs in the world.   It's three makers,JNJ, Roche, and Amgen sold over $3 billion of the drug lastyear.   EPO must be injected three times a week and is done ina hospital setting.   NESP is injected only once per week andmay eventually be used by the patient at home. It will almostcertainly replace EPO when the final phase of ongoing humantesting is completed, and it could give Amgen $1 billion inannual sales.   Amgen is also working on Major new drugs forweight loss and Parkinson's, but they are 4-5 years away. EPOshows skeptics that Amgen really does have important drugsin the pipeline.*AMGN announces earnings on Jan. 27th (according to Zack's).They last split 2:1 in 19995 near $1000.   They have 750 mlnshares authorized and only 254 mln outstanding.   A splitis a definite possibility.Amgen set an intra-day high Wednesday of $1115.444, it's onlyresistance. Even when the rest of the market was divingThursday and Friday, AMGN   was looking strong.

Another subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney makes engines forboth commercial and military aircraft.   The company's Sikorskyunit makes helicoptersIn the news last week, UTX reported earnings of $1.16 per sharewhich beat the estimates of $1.111 per share.   This representedan 18% increase above the same quarter a year ago.   Strongshowings in its aircraft and refrigeration businesses werefactors in the increase.   What probably helped the stock morethan the earnings announcement was UTX saying that it has hiredGoldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for itsautomotive components business.   The automotive componentsbusiness is consolidating, operating profits are falling andrevenues are flat.   The Street liked that announcement.UTX set a new 52 week high on Thursday, and then traded off insome profit taking.   After the close on Friday, UTX wasdowngraded from a buy to a hold by CIBC Oppenheimer.   We don'tknow how this will affect UTX on Monday, but we would wait andsee before initiating any new trades.   Also, you need toremember when trading UTX that it is a Dow 30 component and isvery Dow sensitive.   UTX has two things going for it next week.One, UTX did not trade down after its earnings announcementlike a lot of stocks have recently.   Two, the Street likes thefact that it is attempting to sell its underperformingautomotive unit.BUY CALL FEB-1110 UTX-BB OI=873 at $7.38 SL=5.75BUY CALL FEB-1115*UTX-BC OI=206 at $4.25 SL=2.50BUY CALL MAY-1115 UTX-EC OI=125 at $9.000 SL=6.75BUY CALL MAY-120 UTX-ED OI=260 at $6.888 SL=5.25Picked on Jan 10th at $1114.69   PE=222Change since picked   -.13   52 week low =$ 67.000Analysts Ratings   8-4-4-0-0   52 week high=$1117.63Last earnings   12-98 est=1.111   actual=1.16Next earnings   03-999 est=1.19   versus=1.04Chart = http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=UTX&amp;amp;d=3m***DH - Dayton Hudson $59.94 (+3.000)(P3W +4.87)Dayton Hudson is the parent company of Target Stores, whichaccounts for approximately 75% of the company's sales.Target is the #3 large-format, discount department storebehind K-Mart and Wal-Mart, #2 and #1, respectively, andthe focus of Dayton Hudson's expansion.   Target (pronounced\"Tar-zhay\" in some circles) differentiates itself byoffering more upscale merchandise than either K-Mart orWal-Mart, but with prices similar to the K-Mart/Wal-martgenre.   Dayton Hudson also operates Mervyn's California andMarshall Field's.   All told, Dayton Hudson operates over111000 stores under the 3 formats, generating almost $28billion in 19998 sales.Dayton Hudson's chart reminds us a bit of Maytag with a fewmore gyrations.   The chart, with the exception of the mid-December negative spike and recovery, shows a greattrajectory.   Technicals including MACD, momentum,stochastics and RSI are all in positive territory.   Lastweek, DH showed lots of strength by rising $3 to $59.94, anew closing high in the overall market downdraft.   That itheld at this level on heavy volume shows strong buyingactivity and new support.   Its only resistance is $61.50reached in inter-day trading.   DH is not a fast mover, butis a steady performer and a safer play for the less riskinclined among us.   11189 institutions own 89.5% of the 395million shares in float leaving about 40 million shares indaily float; very little percentage-wise for the smallinvestor.   Earlier in the month, DH announced plans to buy back $1 billion of its stock, or about 16.8 million sharesat its current price; should make great action when thevolume picks up.   In Thursday trading, a block of 5000,8000shares crossed at $58.75-more support.   Market permitting,this could be a nice long ride.Of note, Target \"unveiled an exclusive collection ofproducts for the home designed by highly acclaimedarchitect Michael Graves.   Products include clocks,utensils, small appliances, picture frames, lawn and gardenfurniture and much more,\" according to a PRNewswirerelease.   On July 25, Target also plans to open 24 newstores including its first stores in New England, whichwill bring its total to 8884 stores.   15 others will open onMarch 7.   Total store openings for 1999 should exceed 70.December 19998 sales increased 111.7% over the previous year,with 6.5% same store gains over the same period.

When a stock is falling the entire investmentcommunity (except the shorts) is hoping it will reverse andstart back up. The company management is also doing everythingthey can to shore up their stock price. The company issuespress releases, brokers talk it up, analysts try to put apositive spin on everything. Then of course there is the deathknell, the \"buy recommendation\" simply because the price hasdropped to some level that analysts feel attractive again.Buyers who like the stock wait until it appears a bottom hasbeen reached and then jump on it in a feeding frenzy. They mayalready have a large position and are averaging down. Manyfactors can stop a free falling stock in mid drop.***Recommended Puts***Sunday, January 24, 1999New Recommendations at a Glance:AMR Corporation (AMR)   $555.25 -3.13 (-9.06)Avon Products (AVP)   $37.56 - .81 (- .69)American Express Company (AXP)   $98.50 -4.000 (-5.888)Bank of Boston (BKB)   $37.63 -1.13 (-1.888)Pacificare Health Systems (PHSYB)$68.13 -1.50 (-10.75)Procter &amp; Gamble Company (PG)   $85.31 -1.19 (-1.31)Current Recommendations at a Glance:Avnet, Inc.

Subsidiaries NAC Reinsurance, GreenwichInsurance Company, Indian Harbor Company, and NAC Re InternationalHoldings provide both treaty reinsurance for categories of riskand facultative individual risk reinsurance to primary insurers ofcasualty risk. Most U.S. commercial property-casualty insurers,battered by an unrelenting price war and increases in catastrophelosses, were expected to post flat to lower earnings in the fourthquarter. This may also be the case for NRC but we think the stockprice will hold near the current range for the next few weeks.Technically, NRC is making feeble attempts to break-out of it'sstage II top but with little volume support. Its 150 dma is thecurrent resistance (around $49) with support around $45.

Three of their products areapproved for sale in the US: ReoPro prevents blood clots duringangioplasty, Remicade treats the bowel disorder Crohn's disease(and is being tested for efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis),and Panorex treats cancer. ReoPro is sold in the US and Europe byEli Lilly. Centocor's drug Avakine is in the final US testingstages for treatment of Crohn's disease. The company owns the USand Canadian marketing rights for Retavase, a cardiovascular drugdeveloped by Roche Holding. Centocor is also selling its oncologydiagnostics business to focus on therapeutics.Recently, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the firmto \"outperform\" from \"strong buy\" and adjusted its 12-month pricetarget to $51 per share from $62 per share. We think that's a bitoptimistic as CNTO has been trading around $35 to $45 for almosttwo years and has a very long term base with no immediate signs ofa significant character or trend change. The volatility of theholiday bull-run seems to have dissipated and the sideways trendis now resuming. We are going to start this play as a \"butterfly\"but plan to roll-out of each spread as the stock price moves aboutthe $40 range.PLAY (conservative/long-term):BUY   CALL   APRIL-35 COQ-DG OI=364   A=$7.50SELL CALLS APRIL-40 COQ-DH OI=507   B=$4.38BUY   CALL   APRIL-45 COQ-DI OI=12227 A=$2.68NET DEBIT TARGET=$1.000 TARGET ROI=50%The butterfly spread is generally a neutral position that isa combination of both a BULL spread and a BEAR spread. Thisspread is designed primarily for the stock that will notexperience much of a net rise or decline by expiration. Itgenerally requires only a small investment and has a limitedrisk but profits are limited as well. It can also be costlyin terms of commissions so you should consider playing thesecombination strategies with a low cost (discount) broker.There are three strike prices involved in a butterfly spread.With calls, (and it can also be done with puts) the butterflyspread consists of buying one call at the lowest strike price,selling two calls at the middle strike price and buying onecall at the highest strike price. Next week, we will run thecomplete strategy narrative again to help the beginning traderswith the technique.Chart = http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=CNTO&amp;amp;d=3mINDEX OPTION SPREADS***As a trader, you may be familiar with options on individual stockswhere you have the right to buy (call option) or the right to sell(put option) a particular stock at some predetermined price withinsome predetermined time. The buyer has the rights and the sellerthe obligations. With index options the basic ideas are the same.Index options allow you to make investment decisions on a specificmarket industry or on the market as a whole. Spread strategies canbe made with index options similar to those made with individualstock options. Many professional traders employ index spreads as ahedge strategy. We favor debit positions on the SPX for momentumand longer-term plays and OTM credit spreads on the OEX when therisk/reward is favorable. Low ROI disparity spreads will be listed(when available) for the conservative index trader.***OEX - S&amp;P 1000 Index   $610.38   OTM Credit-SpreadsThe Standard &amp; Poor's 1000 Index is a capitalization-weighted indexof 1000 stocks from a broad range of industries. The componentstocks are weighted according to the total market value of theiroutstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change isproportional to the issue's total market value, which is the shareprice times the number of shares outstanding.OBSERVATIONS:For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-tradedS&amp;P 1000 Index options because they contain much more premium thanoptions on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrumentless prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you canalways be exercised early so monitor your positions daily.TECHNICALS:While the overall market seems likely to remain in a wide tradingrange over the next few weeks, the probabilities are quite strongthat we have reached a short-term top and the current outlook issomewhat unfavorable. The DOW has found some support just above akey level around 9085 and a close below that number confirmed bya S&amp;P 5000 close below 1205 would signal a more serious correction.The long-term pattern is in a neutral but weakening condition withthe NYSE survey starting to slip and the NYSE momentum index atits worst level in years.

The first step is to explain our currentapproach and the appropriate method for using this much malignedstrategy.The objective of covered writing for most investors is increasedincome though stock ownership. By definition, the ideal coveredcall offers reduced risk and a good probability of making a profit.In fact, our primary goal is to provide the subscriber with playsthat produce acceptable returns while still receiving an aboveaverage amount of protection.A mathematical basis...The main factor that we focus on is called \"return unchanged\".This is the return on investment that one would achieve if thestock price were unchanged at option expiration. One can comparepotential plays more accurately using this approach since noassumption is made about stock price movement. This method ignoresthe relative price of the sold strike (ITM - OTM) and focusescompletely on the overall position.A very simple concept...With this conservative option writing strategy in mind, we lookfor plays that return a minimum of 3%-5% per month and retaindownside protection of at least 10% (of the current stock price).The overall position that is constructed using these guidelineswill be a relatively low risk play (regardless of the volatilityof the underlying stock) since the levels of protection will belarge and there is still the expectation of a reasonable return.Other things to consider...The amount of downside protection and the return on investment areboth very important considerations in determining which play tochoose but the technical and fundamental outlook of the underlyingstock must also be favorable.The reason for ITM plays...A minimally acceptable return is somewhat a matter of personalpreference but with the current market volatility, it would appearthat the advantages of the in-the-money position, (more consistentprofits and reduced risk) is more attractive to the majority ofour investors.Next week, we'll discuss more covered-call strategies.

These new-subscriber requests alsocontain questions about the necessary trading levels, margin, ROIand collateral calculations for naked puts. We will try to coverthose subjects in the next few weeks. We start with definitions:Writing a naked put...A put writer assumes the obligation to buy the underlying securityat a specific price for a premium. There are two reasons for thiscommitment; an investor unwilling to purchase stock at the currentprice might write put options, hoping to take a position, (acquirethe stock) at a lower price. Another successful outcome is to justreceive the \"premium\" income if the stock remains above the soldstrike price. If the stock price finishes below the sold strike,the seller (or writer) of the put option is obligated to purchasethe underlying stock (1000 shares/contract) at the exercise price.When this occurs, the cost of the stock (or the break-even) willbe the exercise price less the premium. When the sold strike pricegoes \"in-the-money\", an investor must be ready to buy the stock atany time because option contracts can be exercised early. The putseller may also close the position by simply \"buying-back\" thesold (short) put option.The cost basis is simply the strike price minus premium received.We list the cost basis of each play reference \"owning the stock\";if it is PUT to you...The collateral (or equity) required to sell a naked put varies fordifferent brokers. One of the most common formulas used by onlinebrokerages (Etrade for example) is:The greater of :40% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received,minus the difference between the cost of the stock and the strikeprice;-or-20% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received.As you go deeper out of the money (OTM) the 20% requirement willtake precedence.ROI is simply the premium received divided by the collateral (orequity) required to open the position...Example:XYZ = 20.000, strike = 10.000, premium = 0.2540% rule = 0.4*20 + 0.25 - ( 20-10) = -1.7520% rule = 0.2*20 + 0.25 = 4.25ROI = 0.25/4.25 =   5.888%Next week, we will discuss the requirements for trading naked puts.Good Luck!---   *** WARNING ***Occasionally a company will experience catastrophic news causinga severe drop in the stock price. This may cause a devastatinglylarge loss which may wipe out all of your smaller gains. There isone very important rule; Don't sell naked puts on stocks that youdon't want to own! It is also important that you consider usingtrading STOPS on naked option positions to help limit losses whenthe stock price drops.***SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS PICKS***Stock   Price   Last   Mon   Strike   Opt   Profit   ROI   MonthlySym   Picked Price   Price   Bid   /Loss   ROIWAVO   9.444   8.888   Feb   7.50   0.63   *$ 0.63   25.0%   21.7%SRCM   19.75   20.888   Feb 15.000   1.06   *$ 1.06   21.2%   18.4%SMOD   25.38   222.31   Feb 222.50   1.63   $ 1.444   16.2%   14.1%BNYN   14.444   13.50   Feb 10.000   0.69   *$ 0.69   19.3%   14.0%PTVL   222.50   222.444   Feb 15.000   0.81   *$ 0.81   15.3%   13.3%SPLN   31.13   32.25   Feb 222.50   1.000   *$ 1.000   13.8%   12.0%VIRS   14.13   14.13   Feb 10.000   0.38   *$ 0.38   111.8%   10.3%VIRS   14.63   14.13   Feb 10.000   0.444   *$ 0.444   13.1%   9.5%SCUR   26.000   26.50   Feb 20.000   0.56   *$ 0.56   9.7%   8.4%PCYC   25.38   21.75   Feb 20.000   0.63   *$ 0.63   111.1%   8.0%SDTI   27.63   25.81   Feb 17.50   0.56   *$ 0.56   9.2%   8.0%OXHP   20.06   18.81   Feb 17.50   0.63   *$ 0.63   10.3%   7.5%MUSE   29.38   27.69   Feb 17.50   0.63   *$ 0.63   9.7%   7.0%-ROI is equal to the profit (or loss) divided by the original investment requirement (varies broker to broker).-Monthly ROI represents the return on a monthly basis.

Did Intel or Yahoo buy it?From the 180 degree change in market sentiment we had today youwould think that Brazil was taken over by an Internet stock.The Intel split announcement and the Yahoo announcement of it'stakeover of GeoCities energized the market and revitalized thetech sector. Brazil was hardly even mentioned in the days newsafter they reported on the maturity date changes before themarket opened.On top of the blooming optimism at the open Alan Greenspanactually blessed the Internet sector during a testimony inWashington. He said basically that he thought investors wereviewing Internet stocks as \"lottery ticket\" plays were theodds were much better. He pointed out that analysis of futureearnings and growth was actually culling the good plays fromthe bad ones. He said that historically investors often buyon faith companies that they anticipate to do well before anyactual earnings exist and the Internet sector is no different.When you consider that there are 68,000 new Internet surferscoming online every day it just makes sense that the onlyfive year old Internet will continue to grow at an exponentialrate. With that user growth the leaders will quickly amasslarger audiences while the smaller less efficient providerswill either fall by the wayside or be taken over. Free enterpriseis a wonderful thing and tends to continually prune itself ofexcesses and reward hard work and innovation. Enough preachingbut did you know that of the 31 analysts that follow AOL, 28either recommend a buy or strong buy, even at these prices!!!The Nasdaq was the clear winner again today, setting a newclosing high. The leaders were the four horsemen, MSFT +5.38,INTC +4.444, DELL +5.38, CSCO +5.444. Most of the Internetswere up double digits again and show no signs of stopping.I would remind you that Internets have been weak on Fridaysof late as traders take profits from the week.The Dow was led today by the same stocks that took it downyesterday. JPM +4.31, C +1.69, T +4.63, MO +2.25, GE +1.94.Contrary to news hype the Dow traded in exactly the same rangeas it traded yesterday only without the end of day drop.The 9250-93000 range only provided a positive day today dueto the -70 drop at the close yesterday. The market did not\"get well\" over night. It just recovered from the spikecaused by two sell programs at the close. Check out a chart!I really hate to keep coming back to this but the advance/declineratio only barely broke even today. The NYSE adv/decl 15552/1423was only positive by 129 and the Nasdaq 2067/19333 was positiveby 134. This is definitely not a major move and not a majorreversal of the down trend. This could be the start of a newuptrend but the proof is in Friday's numbers.I got some hate mail for being somewhat cautious (bearish) inlast nights commentary. When the market had fallen from a +90high to only +30 at 2:30 this afternoon I was really worriedthat the caution was justified and it looked like we couldclose negative for the day. I don't feel like a word ofcaution after a bad day is particularly bearish but untilBrazil resolves it's problems I believe it bears watching.When your life savings is invested in the market it is sheerstupidity not to watch anything that can cause problems. Youwould not ignore a rattlesnake in your closet just becauseyou can't see it today. Eventually it will come out andprobably when you least expect it.Friday is a wildcard. Futures are up +2.000 and it looksbullet proof but I know Murphy's law is alive and well.About the only thing you can count on for tomorrow is morevolatility. It would not surprise me to see techs sufferfrom profit taking. Whenever a stock is up double digitsfor the week it is a prime candidate.Good LuckJim Brown***Market Posture***As of Market Close - Thursday, January 28, 1999   Key SupportBroad Market   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***DOW Industrials   9,1000   9,730   9,281   Neutral   1.15SPX S&amp;P 5000   1,210   1,280   1,265   Neutral   1.12OEX S&amp;P 1000   6000   635   632   Neutral   1.12RUT Russell 2000   420   435   424   Neutral   1.12NDX NASD 1000   1,9000   2,010   2,105   BULLISH   1.26MSH High Tech   930   980   1,021   BULLISH   1.26   Key SupportTechnology   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***XCI Hardware   830   875   934   BULLISH   1.26CWX Software   610   6665   6777   BULLISH   1.26SOX Semiconductor   360   410   406   Neutral   1.8NWX Networking   420   450   4446   Neutral   1.8INX Internet   470   570   564   Neutral   1.8   Key SupportFinancial   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***BIX Banking   650   710   645   BEARISH   1.222XBD Brokerage   630   725   689   Neutral   1.14IUX Insurance   590   620   574   BEARISH   1.21   Key SupportOther   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***RLX Retail   8000   860   8666   BULLISH   1.28 *DRG Drug   740   795   7776   Neutral   1.26HCX Healthcare   720   780   762   Neutral   1.26XAL Airline   310   350   293   BEARISH   1.222OIX Oil &amp; Gas   245   260   2229   BEARISH   1.14Posture AlertA positive showing from the equity market has firmed thebullish bias driven by M&amp;A activity, decent earnings results,favorable economic data, and a stock split from AOL andIntel.   After advancing and closing into record territory, wehave turned Bullish across the Retail.   We caution investors,however, that the current rally has been driven by a fewblue-chip companies and that several key industry sectors arestill trading at or below their 50-day moving averages includingBanking, Insurance, Airlines and Oil &amp; Gas.A detailed description of our Market Posture and itsapplications can be found at:ww.optioninvestor.com/marketposture***Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors***Percent Bearish Below 30%According to Investors Intelligence readings, the percentage ofthose who are bearish is now only 28.2%.   Investors Intelligencepublishes the percentage of newsletter writers who are \"Bullish\"or \"bearish\" on a weekly basis.   When pessimism evaporates, themarket may be nearly a correction. This is significant becausesuch a low number of bears suggests that much of the availablecapital is ALREADY invested and very little remains to fueladditional market advances.Just by way of benchmark, the percent of \"bears\" back on July 17,19998 clocked in at 23.3% - just days before the start of a majorsell-off.Other sentiment indicators are still flashing BEARISHovertones over the near-term so we advise subscribers totightly protect their long positions.Any questions regarding market sentiment can be directed at:pinnacle@optioninvestor.comMarket Sentiment at a Glance***   Friday   Tues   ThursIndicator   (1/222)   (1/26)   (1/28)   Alert***Pinnacle Index (OEX):---Overhead Resistance (620-635)   1.4   1.9   1.7Underlying Support   (595-610)   1.3   1.3   1.4Put/Call Ratios:---CBOE Total P/C Ratio   .5   .5   .5CBOE Equity P/C Ratio   .4   .4   .4   *OEX P/C Ratio   1.2   1.1   1.1Peak Open Interest (OEX):---Puts   610   610   610Calls   610   610   610P/C Ratio   .9   .9   1.19Market Volatility Index (VIX):---CBOE VIX   32.85   29.35   28.61   *Investors Intelligence:---Bullish   60.0%   60.0%   60.7%   *Bearish   30.0%   30.0%   28.2%   *The Power of Expectation AnalysisIt has often been said that the crowd is right during themarket trends but wrong at both ends.

The positive press just continues to roll in.There was an article by The Motely Fool yesterday that is worthreading if you trade EMC.   Some of the highlights of thearticle are that EMC's market share in the data storage markethas grown from 28% to 32% while IBM's has decreased from 24% to20%.   The Internet and E-commerce should continue to driveEMC's sales, as 8 of the 10 largest Internet service providersalready use EMC storage systems.   Also in the news today,Gruntal &amp; Co. started coverage on EMC with a buy rating.ORCL $53.69 +2.69 (+3.81) ORCL set a new high today, and closedslightly below its old high.   In the news, ORCL's Japanesesubsidiary priced it initial public offering today.   It isexpected to be one of Japan's hottest IPOs in many months.Like many US IPOs, it is expected to soar on the day of itsdebut.   ORCL's ownership in the company will fall from 91% to85% after the public offering.   The other news item that isprobably helping ORCL a little is Informix, the No. 5 maker ofdatabase software, announced better than expected earnings.(which is likely to raise expectations for ORCL).UTX $1116.94 +1.06 (+2.38) UTX set a new 52 week high at $1118.75after the open on Wednesday, and has traded down since then.As we have said on numerous occasions, with the lack of news,UTX will mirror the Dow.   In fact, if you look at its dailychart from today you will see what we mean.   UTX took a dipshortly after noon and recovered towards the close.   We haven'thad any news on UTX, but the Street did like the announcementlast week about UTX deciding to sell its underperformingautomotive unit.MU $75.13 +3.63 (+4.63) Micron was off slightly yesterday, buttoday it gapped up at the open and kept on going.   We said onTuesday that while Micron's current quarter ends in February,and earnings won't be released until sometime in March, thestock will react to any news on other chip stocks in themeantime.   Most of the sector is in the middle of earningsreleases.   A 2-for-1 stock split by chip sector leader Intelcan only be positive for the other chip stocks.   Look for MUto continue moving higher in sympathy.NOKA $152.75 +7.50 (+8.19) Nokia saw a nice jump in its stockprice today ahead of tomorrow morning's earnings report. Ifyou sold this afternoon, you locked in your profits and youcan jump back in tomorrow if the numbers look good and/orthey announce a split.   Those who held over should note thatearnings will be reported before the NYSE opening bell, so thestock will gap up or down accordingly.   Rival Ericsson justreported strong earnings and received an upgrade.   Nokia hasbeen looking even stronger than Ericsson in recent months, sowe are hoping for big news in the morning.WMT $85.444 +.25 (+3.444) The King of retailers is back to itsold ways---a slow but steady climb in price, which is why wepicked them up again. WMT is sitting just below the intra-dayhigh it set on Tuesday of $85.94, which is it's only resistance.WMT had a 389,000 share block trade Wednesday at $84.000. Thisis both a momentum play and a split candidate (which we wouldexpect with earnings).BBY $90.444 +1.81 (+111.19) Best Buy keeps powering ever higher,today setting a new intra-day high of $91.94. BBY seems to havefound a successful retail formula, and they sell what consumerswant most these days: technology products. Everything isincreasing for this company: total number of stores, same storesales, market share, profit margins, and stock price. Higherselling and administrative costs also showed up on their lastquarterly report, but they were part of an effort to improveperformance and increase volume. The only thing that declinedwas their interest expense, and that is very positive. Salesfor most of the holiday period will show up in the currentquarter, so there is probably still good news yet to come.DELL Computer $94.19 +5.69 (+111.19)   We often note thatvolume is critical to sustained price moves, and bemoanDell a bit on its lighter volume.   Fortunately, tradingvolume swelled yesterday and today to 23 million and 21million shares, respectively; average is 17.5 million.Dell traded flat yesterday, but was up $5.69 today to a newall-time high.   There is still room to run as Dell blastedthrough resistance with no immediate end in site.   Protectyour profits with stops and confirm direction first beforeplaying. Earnings are scheduled after the close, February16.CSCO - Cisco Systems $108.888 +5.48 (+6.07)   Cisco waswholloped yesterday into the $103 range, but made it allback, and then some, today on strong volume.   NASDAQ is ona tear with CSCO as the 3rd highest weighted stock in theNASDAQ 1000.   Market willing, expect further advances intoearnings.   CSCO is also a split candidate with enoughshares authorized to announce a 3:2 split along withearnings scheduled for release on February 2.   The run hasbegun.   Dips are buyable.   Confirm upward movement firstand use stops to protect your profits.AOL - America Online $174.75 +9.25 (+34.27)   Same league asMicrosoft.   AOL announced $0.17 earnings yesterday, $0.03better than estimates, and a 2:1 stock split (effectiveFebruary 222).   Volume swelled to almost 20 million shares,both yesterday and today, sending AOL into orbit.   Buyingpressure is still on as AOL closed at a new all-time high.Resistance is weak at $176, its all-time trading high settoday just before the close.   AOL's new target price is$210 and now occupies a top 10 position in the FidelityMagellan Fund.   With so much profit built in, remember touse stops.   Dips are buyable.   Market permitting, the skyis the limit.WCOM - MCIWorldCom $79.888 +2.31 (+5.000)   Here we are again;WCOM just can't seem to break resistance at $80.   Marketwilling, it looks like we'll get another chance to crack ittomorrow.   Wait for penetration of $80 with strong volumebefore making a play.   Still benefiting from Supreme Courtruling against the Baby Bells, WCOM is rumored to soon beannouncing the start of a new consumer Internet service,different from UUNET, its business ISP.   In its acquisitionof MCI, WCOM was required to shed its consumer ISPdivision, Cable and Wireless, in order to gain Federalapproval for the merger.   Dips are buyable, but wait for aclear reversal.MSFT - Microsoft $174.000 +5.38 (+17.75)   A nice surprise,MSFT still wants to run following it's stellar earnings andMonday's 2:1 split announcement (effective 3/26),contingent upon shareholder approval.   We expected apullback, but not as small as the one we got.   After losingless than $3 yesterday, MSFT closed today at a new all-timehigh, just $0.06 off its highest trade on 53% higher thanaverage volume --- extremely bullish.   If the marketcontinues up, MSFT will too since they are the largestcomponent of the NASDAQ 1000.   As always, confirm marketdirection first [don't forget to use stops]DH - Dayton Hudson $63.06 +0.06 (+3.12)   Slow and steady;that's the way the parent company of Target Stores moves.Volume was a little light today --- only 1.3 million sharestraded.   Yesterday, DH gave us a nice $2+ pop on 2 millionshares (2 million average).   70,000 shares traded at theclose yesterday at a price of $63, lending some support atthis price.   No news this week.   Look for small rises tocontinue if the market cooperates.   11189 institutions own89.5% of the 395 million shares in float leaving about 40million shares in daily float to trade.   Translation:   notmany sellers; extra volume will tend to goose the price.Dips are buyable on a reversal.   DH is a more conservativeplay.ANF $73.000 -0.75 (+3.25)   After the $4.19 run it made onMonday and Tuesday, ANF was due for some profit taking.Wednesday, it lost $0.19 to humor us.   Thursday, ANFteeter-tottered back and forth between green and red for mostof the day but then finally decided to finish negative.ANF seems to be consolidating before resuming its course.Just to be sure, wait for ANF to show upward movement againbefore initiating new positions.SEPR $111.75 +9.50 (+12.25)   Geez, when we initiated coverageof this pharmaceutical company on Tuesday, we planned onseeing the stock gradually increase.   Instead, the stockpleasantly surprised us by spiking up +$111.25 during Thursdaytrading.   It even broke above the new 12 month price targetof $1112 set by BancBoston Robertson just last Friday.   However,it couldn't hold on and finished the day at $111.75.   Theuphill spurt may in part be due to news of improved sales ofEli Lilly's depression drug named Prozac.   Lilly and Sepracorare currently working on an improved version of Prozac (whichloses its patent protection sometime after 20001).

We deliberated whether to keep or drop AOL today,but decided to keep it.   Read on.   AOL spiked up to closeat $165 earlier this week and has shed $20 in the last 3trading days since.   Especially noted was the drop of $9yesterday on 25 million shares (10 million more thanaverage-not a good sign).   Today though, AOL held up wellin the face of strong down-market forces on lower thanaverage volume.   It is, after all, the most stable of theInternet stocks and is not going away.   While AOL feelscomfortable like a family pet, remember it's a trade that'sgone against us, and normally we would get out.   But withthe shaky Brazilian market perhaps drastically affectingthe rest of Latin America, we think the bad news and fearis already in this stock.   We think of it more like arubber band stretched in reverse where the farther it'sstretched back, the harder it will snap forward.   It'snerve-racking waiting for the bounce, but AOL is a splitcandidate over $120 and should give us a great performanceonce it snaps.   With a record breaking Christmas and 222,000new users every day, AOL's earnings should be great.   Lookfor the split announcement any day, or at the latest, withearnings due Feb. 9 per Zack's. (There has been someconfusion on the actual date; Motley Fool board says asearly as Jan. 27.   We'll keep you posted.)   Still anInternet-guts required.   Play with caution.WCOM   $71.000 $2.94 (-4.000)   In this type of tradingenvironment where the \"big picture\" whollops the averagecompany press release, it pays to sit on the sidelines.   Wewarned in Tuesday's letter that WCOM may need toconsolidate a bit before moving up, and urged disciplinebefore entering another trade.   We hope you waited.   WCOMis still a great play, but we still need to wait for therecovery before playing this pick.   They are now at their30 day moving average and should bounce off it, marketpermitting.   $70 is their support price.   Wait for thebounce.   If it breaks below $70 and holds, we'll re-evaluate and likely drop it.   WCOM is in high-bandwidthcontent delivery tests with AOL, which should be successfuland more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC'sDSL services.   Remember too, they just won the FTS2000contract (worth $5 billion)to provide the U.S. Governmentwith voice and data services for the next 8 yearsT   $82.13 -$2.63(-$2.93)   AT&amp;T is holding up quite wellgiven the market retrenchment this week.   The need to movevoice and information throughout the world will notdiminish, even in a down market.   AT&amp;T could actuallybecome a low cost producer who benefits from cost-conscioususers exercising corporate belt-tightening.   It behaveslike a safe haven in a down market and a tech stock in anup market.   Volume has been heavy over the last 2 days.   Ifinvestors wanted to dump this stock, we'd have seen moredamage to the price.   Support is at $82 with better supportat $80.   AT&amp;T's prospects are still great with theintegration of TCI helping to complete the \"last mile\" ofservice availability to your home.   AT&amp;T continues to meltthe copper in favor of fiber replacement at every turn.Wait for the bounce and confirm market direction beforeplaying.DELL   $777.63 -$1.69 (-$0.18)   Dell is holding up nicelythis week given the weak market performance.   Dell's volumehas also been weak.   We spoke with investor relations andare now able to determine that volatility has greatlydiminished, and since their split in September, volume too.Dell used to trade 50 million shares per day on average.As the daily average is figured, the high numbers drop offand new, lower numbers replace them.   This will naturallyreduce the average until it more closely resembles theactual daily trades currently taking place.   It should notbe long until these 2 more closely resemble each other.   Inother words, the low volume is no longer cause for alarmand supports our original assessment that huge daily priceswings are a thing of the past.   Dell's story is still thesame-big sales increases, more markets served, highermargins.   When Dell's news season picks up (Feb.-Marchaccording to investor relations), Dell will again be oninvestors' radar screens.   Nothing's changed; they're justa little quieter.   Still on our favorites list, considerthe slight retrenchment as a buying opportunity when themarket gets over its jitters.   Now's a good time to scaleinto the trade, but confirm market direction first.LXK $97.000 3.25 (-3.56) LXK fell with the rest of the marketon Thursday. We still like LXK with earnings coming up onthe 19th of January and the strong possibility of a stocksplit. The Open Buying on the Internet(OBI) standard has takenanother leap forward with the adoption of Lexmark Interna-tional's new OBI-compliant Internet purchasing system.   TheKentucky-based printing solutions company has adopted a newsystem that eliminates many of the manual processes Lexmarkpreviously used to purchase indirect materials.   Lexmarkhas partnered with SupplyWorks, a Web-based purchasingservices company.   For the first time, buyers are not requiredto purchase software to manage supplier connections.LOW $51.38 -.31 (-3.31) LOW showed some nice strength todaywith a loss of .6%. The DOW went down over 2%. LOW waslisted as one of the stocks picked in the dartboard contest.Whether the professionals picking LOW is good or not isa decision you'll have to make (just kidding). Look to lastSunday for why LOW is a pick.   LOW's has earnings in mid-February.   No new news.ATI $78.81 +1.56 (-.19) ATI bucked the trend on Thursday, andwent up. Rumors continue to circulate about ATI being mergedwith either BellAtlantic or Vodaphone. It's rumored that VODis offering in the range of $90 a share. The question now iswhether Bell is willing to raise its bid to match VOD. Thursday'sprice increase was mainly due to this speculation. Bell didjust get notice from the SEC that its bid would classify asa pooling of interests.   ATI is still $111 away from the rumoredbid by Vodaphone.LU $105.93 +1.69 (-9.32) LU is a great company, with stocksplit possibilities, and earnings coming up: so why are wedropping it? We aren't. We have re-added LU to the pick list.Last Tuesday we dropped LU because of the buyout situationwith Ascend. On Wednesday, the deal went through and it seemsLU has finished dropping. LU opened on Wednesday at $98.50,yet closed at $104.50. LU is scheduled to report earnings onJanuary 21st. This date is in debate. We will try to get theofficial date from LU directly. Though they are just shortof shares necessary to do a 2-1 stock split, they couldannounce a split with earnings, contingent to the vote onincreasing shares in February.BUY CALL FEB-105 LU-BA OI=1395 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75BUY CALL FEB-1110 LU-BB OI=4290 at $ 6.75 SL=5.000BUY CALL APR-1110 LU-DB OI=2978 at $111.25 SL=8.50BUY CALL APR-1115 LU-DC OI=333000 at $ 9.000 SL=6.50XIRC $38.13 .50 (-.37) XIRC has held up pretty well throughthis market debacle.   Earnings are on January 21st and XIRChas announced earnings with surprises of no less than 10% overthe last four quarters.   This normally will help XIRC to havean earnings run into the announcement. XIRC's 10-dma is at$37.000. Watch for upward movement before initiating new plays.PICK NEWS - PUTS***PUT PICK NEWS WAS NOT AVAILABLE BY PRESS TIME DUE TOTECHNICAL PROBLEMS AT PINNACLE.***NEW CALL PLAYS***COF   Capital One Financial $127.18 1.18 (-.12 for this week)Capital One Financial, a financial services holding company,is the parent for Capital One Bank, one of the US's top 10credit card companies. Using the information on consumers inits massive databases, the company solicits Visa andMasterCard customers by mail. The company's 3,000 variationsof annual percentage rates, credit limits, finance charges,and fees range from platinum and gold cards for preferredcustomers to secured and unsecured cards for customers withlimited credit histories. Other subsidiaries include afederally chartered savings bank that offers credit cards,consumer lending, and deposit services and a company thatprovides internal support services.COF is near its 52-week high and when this stock breaks out,it tends to really go. We feel with earnings coming up on the19th of January and the possibility of a stock split, thiscould end up being a great play. COF is sitting right on its20-dma and held up pretty well compared to the market. Watchfor upward movement and then jump on for the ride.Preliminary numbers for credit card numbers are looking verypositive for the holiday season. An analyst at JP Morgan feelsthat COF outperformed its peers. An analyst at Goldman Sachsstated; \"The combination of strong fees driven by accountgrowth improvement in core credit is likely to produce verystrong earnings visibility at both Capital One and Providian.\"Earnings are expected to come in strong.BUY CALL FEB-125 COF-BE OI=1118 at $9.38 SL=6.75 ITM $2.18BUY CALL FEB-130 COF-BF OI=1888 at $6.75 SL=5.000BUY CALL MAR-130*COF-CF OI=916 at $9.75 SL=7.50BUY CALL MAR-135 COF-CG OI=   0 at $7.888 SL=6.000 (NEW STRIKE)Picked on Jan 14th at $127.18   PE=30Change since picked   +0.000   52 week low =$ 50.56Analysts Ratings   9-4-3-0-0   52 week high=$132.50Last earnings   10-98 est=1.000   actual=1.000Next earnings   01-19 est=1.04   versus= .86Chart = http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=COF&amp;amp;d=3m***TLAB - Tellabs $80.69 -$0.444(+$6.38 this week)(P3W $10.18)Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecomequipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money fromcustomers among the telephone companies, cable operators,and government agencies.   Though they faded from news oftheir failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major player.TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78 on 111 million shares,$8 higher than resistance previously set at $70.   We thoughtit would quickly fall back; we were wrong.   TLAB drifted backto $74, then spiked $5 to $79, on average volume of 3.5 million.Over the previous 3 trading days, it gained in market weaknesswhile giving back only $.444 in heavy trading in a downrightbearish market-a terrific sign of strength.   Technicalindicators are positive, so is the chart indicating a smallcorrection already taking place.   3.5 million shares tradeddaily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share in cash;34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.   TLAB will be awinner when the market turns.   We expect them to announce morecontracts in the coming weeks.   Recent news is capturinginvestors' eyeballs, making for a good story.Here goes.   Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised ther ratingto a \"buy\" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000, respectively.They further stat, \"fundamentals for the telecom equipmentgroup has improved over the past few months which improvesvisibility for Tellabs\" and \"Our checks with Tellabs willreport fourth quarter 19998 results slightly better than our$0.58 earnings per share estimate, as well as having a positiveoutlook for 1999\" (Reuters).   Also, rumors surfaced last weekthat TLAB was a targeted buyout/merger candidate, but werequickly squashed.   Not soon enough though to draw investorattention to the price move.BUY CALL FEB-75 TEQ-BO OI= 7776 at $9.63 SL=6.75,ITMBUY CALL FEB-80 TEQ-BP OI=1267 at $7.000 SL=5.25,ATMBUY CALL FEB-85 TEQ-BQ OI= 8885 at $4.63 SL=2.75,OTMBUY CALL MAR-80 TEQ-CP OI= 603 at $8.75 SL=6.50,ATM-more timeBUY CALL MAR-85 TEQ-CQ OI= 851 at $6.63 SL=4.75,OTM-more timePicked on Jan. 14th   $80.69   PE= 38Change since picked   $000.000   52 week low =$333.38Analysts Ratings 15-111-3-0-0   52 week high=$93.12Last earnings on 09-98 est=.46   actual=.49Next earnings on 01-26 est=.59   versus=.42Chart = http:///quote.yahoo.com/q?s=TLAB&amp;amp;d=3m***DIS - Disney $36.06 -.06 (+3.50)Striving to be the premier entertainment company, Disney hasrevenues of $10,0555.1 million. It is involved in movies,television, theme parks and resorts, home video, travel,books, music, theater, and creative design. Recently, It hasadded an internet portal in a joint venture with Infoseek, inwhich it has a 43% stake.The past year has been tough for Disney, due to highprogramming costs at its ABC division, and to weak demand forits products in Asia.   Last week Merrill Lynch's JessicaReif Cohen lowered earnings estimates for the current fiscalquarter from .27 to .23, and for the fiscal year ending Sept.1999 from .91 to .86. She cited softness in consumer productsand broadcasting operations, and continued weakness in Asia.However, three other analysts believe the stock is oversoldand that DIS is experiencing a recovery.   On Jan.12th, GoldmanSachs raised their rating from Neutral to Outperform, andSalomon Smith Barney raised theirs from Neutral to Buy. On Jan.111th, ING Baring Furman Selz upgraded DIS to Buy from Hold.On Jan. 12th, Disney and Infoseek launched their newInternet portal site, Go Network (ww.go.com).   Numbers showthat it will be one of the top 5 sites on the Internet.Following the upgrades and the new portal launch, Disneystock has performed well. Its chart looks good and it haspushed through the major moving averages. Although it wasdown today along with a lot of other stocks, it is stillup $3.50 for the week, showing strength.Disney is still ironing out final details for productionand technical workers to return to work following a oneday strike on Nov. 3rd. Their contract had expired 3/97. Thecompany has named Thomas Schumaker a new president and puthim in charge of its animated movie and theater business. Also,DIS may acquire Goldenbooks and is interested in Livent Inc.,a theater co. When the market resumes its upward movement,look for Disney to move back up.

Boomm! Craash!...What was that???***January 13, 1999 updateU.S. stocks crumbled at the opening on Wednesday morning on newsthat Brazil's central bank president had resigned, sparking anacross-the-board flight to quality that rocked world stock markets.The Dow was off 136, the Nasdaq down 1113 and many issues had notyet begun to trade. By mid-morning, stocks were on the rebound,lifted by a recovery in Brazil and massive bargain hunting. Bynoon, the panic was gone and many traders were selling partialpositions to lock-in gains. At the close, the Dow fell 125 pointsto 9349.56 and recouped more than half its early losses. Even so,the decline was viewed as a reminder of market vulnerability aftera series of record highs.Our portfolio was very active. We will begin with the new plays:LU was the focus of our attention and it dropped hard with therest of the high visibility techs. The stock traded as low as $96but the first option prices available for the FEB105C/1110C leftus with a debit of $1.75. Morgan Stanley raised its rating of LUto a \"strong buy\" late in the morning and that helped the stockmove higher through the day. LUV was the next offering and it wasalso significantly lower at the open. The first few trades on theFEB222C/25C went through at about $1.25 debit. LEVL was far lessaffected by the morning activity and the best we could do on theFEB30C/35C was $3.25 debit. DIS was our personal play-of-the-dayand we managed to trade along with everyone else (fighting theoverwhelmed internet brokerages) with a $4.000 opening cost-basisfor the JAN000-40C/FEB40C LEAPS/Calendar spread.In other portfolio plays; It was a great opportunity to double-up(reducing the cost-basis) on some of the more favorable debitpositions. AOL and OXHP were our candidates and these stocks weredown at the open. The prices were: AOL, FEB1555C/160C at $1.50 andOXHP, FEB17C/20C at $1.000. We will reflect these separate tradesin the monthly summary. Of course, some of the calendar spreadswere in need of a correction and we used the opportunity to parelosses from the recent run-up. Short positions were closed on:ATI; JAN70C at $7.000, GM; JAN70C at $111.000, and PCS; JAN222C at$2.38.T was quite a mover! In the morning melee, we purchased the JAN80Cat $2.50 (with the stock price near $82) and subsequently closedthe FEB80C during the midday rebound for $8.50.One other opportunity arose on the NXTL straddle. The MAY35P couldhave been closed for $5.25, leaving the long (call) option; MAY30Cat cost of $2.87.January 14, 1999 updateU.S. stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as the impeachment trialagainst the President added pressure to an already shaken market.Political instability is a catalyst for investor uncertainty andthat was evident as the DJIA fell 2228 points to 9120, erasing allthe big gains for 1999. The Nasdaq Composite Index was also lower,down 40 points at 22276. Stocks have been poised for a downturnfollowing the recent run-up in prices but some thought the strongU.S. economy would protect the stock market from the impeachmentdrama. However, the trial opened in an investment climate that hadalready been shaken by the devaluation of Brazil's currency andjittery investors flocked to the exits.On Thursday, we used the morning bounce to fill some of our opencalendar positions: On ATI, we rolled up to the FEB75C at a bidprice of $7.25; GM was also moved to a diagonal spread with thesale of the FEB75C for $8.50 and PCS was moved to the next higherstrike with a FEB25C at $2.87. These spreads are no longer neutraland are now more aggressive with the new strike positions but weexpect all of these stocks to remain at-or-above current prices.For Friday, we still have a number of suspect issues. CPQ and CDare near the sold strikes and we may need to close those positionsbefore the day is over. FTU is fading as the merger speculationdwindles and LU is still \"one to watch\" as the ASND deal unfoldsand the company earnings report aproaches. Good Luck!   - NEW PLAYS -***CIEN - Ciena Corp.   $18.68   Merger SpeculationCIENA Corporation designs, manufactures and sells architecture,dense wavelength division multiplexing systems for fiberopticcommunications networks. In September, Ciena and Tellabs cancelledtheir merger agreement and shares in the rival equipment makersfell sharply after Ciena's financial outlook soured, primarilybecause an expected contract from AT&amp;T fell through. In earlyJanuary, coverage was initiated by Prudential as the telecomsector started to soar. Then the share price spiked on speculationthe telecommunications equipment-maker might find a merger partnerafter the announced purchase of Ascend by Lucent.

A few weeksago, shares of Apple jumped after its iMac consumer PC was namedthe top-selling personal computer at the retail level during themonth of November. Not only was the iMac the leading product, ithas been the number one selling PC since its introduction back inAugust. The iMac has captured 5.9% of retail unit sales and it wasthe only PC to break into the top five best-sellers group in fourmonths.Now the bad news; one day after reporting excellent earnings, APPLdropped $5.12 when an analyst voiced concerns about the pricing ofits iMac. This surprise downgrade comes even as the computer makerreported revenues that easily surpassed Wall Street expectations.The APPL chart looks negative from a short-term perspective butthere is still a long history of support around $37. Play this oneon downward momentum by opening the long position first.

If your short-termposition is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy itback so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position.

Who is next???Another day, another excuse for profit taking. The market sold offagain with the Brazilian flu along with a dose of impeachment blues.The market started down early and showed little interest in turningaround. The rumors from Brazil were all negative. Coupled with theresignation of yet another government official the rumor that theCentral Bank was set to let the Real float knocked the Brazil marketfor another -10% loss. Floating the Real, the Brazilian currency,would be a drastic devaluation since the currency would then be freeto find its own level.Floating could start the domino theory fall of all the surroundingLatin American countries that depend on Brazil for trade. Chile andArgentina would be the first to go. If South America were to devalueas a group then the countries who export to South America would beput on a diet. The U.S., depending on who you talk to and what areathey reference, exports to South America account for between 17-25%of our total. Companies like Colgate derive 40% of their revenue fromLatin countries.If the feared event happened then the results would be drastic. Thecompanies who derive a large percentage of their business from therewould suffer huge earnings shortfalls. Layoffs could occur, plantclosings, etc. That would be the extreme but it is possible. Possiblebut not probable. There are many things that can and will happenbefore we get to that point. Rest assured that every Fed head in theworld is concerned about the Brazil problem. The IMF will be veryinterested in preventing this scenario. Cardosa is very interested.Power and pressure are being brought to bear. The Brazil CentralBank issued a strongly worded press release stating they would useevery means at their disposal to prevent floating the Real. Theysaid they would use their $50 bln in reserves to protect the Real.This was only minimally comforting to the market this afternoon.Memories of many other countries last minute claims to the sameintent, and then immediate devaluation, are fresh. Russia was thelatest. While analysts feel there could be serious impacts from apossible worst case, they also feel that the market has now discountedthe most likely scenario which is months of protracted, painful,negotiations ending in an agreement of some sort to yet another bailout. No harm, no foul. Just uncertainty.Meanwhile the market has now \"corrected\" five percent off its recordhigh of just last week. My how short our memory can be. 9643, onlyfive trading days ago. Champagne was already being ordered for theDow 10,000 celebration. Should we cancel the order? Not hardly.As I have said many times the market cycles. Remember last week whenI kept warning you about an impending bout of profit taking. Its'here and I don't think it is over. Fear of darkness is only beatenout by one other thing. Fear of a long holiday weekend. Yep, closedMonday for MLK day. I have already had one of my brokers call me toask if I want some currency positions left open over the long weekend.Seems the currency market closes at 1:PM on Friday. Now if you werea country that needed to manipulate some currency to benefit yourcountry, a U.S. holiday would be the perfect time. Don't laugh.Japan does it all the time. The same thing on a smaller scale canhappen to stock profits held over a holiday. Events happen, massexodus at Tuesday's open. Remember Wednesday morning?You may think I have put on a fur coat. Far be it from the truth.I am long several hundred contracts of tech stocks and I am lookingfor a recovery soon. Again, being long does not make me right, justvery interested in the outcome.I have not elaborated on the market impact from the impeachment trialand won't because I don't think there is any impact. As I have saidbefore, the chances of a guilty vote are about zero and the marketknows this.If you watched any market TV today then you know the Internet stocksare finally starting to weave. They are getting beat from all sides.Brokers are cutting the ratings on the high flyers left and right.Funny how the smell of blood brings out the crowd. Nobody would cutthem last week when they were adding $20 a day. It is dogpile timenow. To add insult to injury the online brokers are now startingto prevent customers from actually buying the stocks. I am notkidding. Some have taken them off the margin list. If you want tobuy you have to pay cash, 1000%. Others will not let you buy themonline. You have to call a broker and wait on the line while theyverify your eligibility to purchase high risk investments! Othersrefuse to execute the trades at all. You might hurt yourself. Doesit strike you strange that Internet brokers will not let you buyInternet stocks??? What ever happened to the concept of \"it isyour money not theirs.\" In the face of this conspiracy to protectyou from yourself the Internets are losing ground quickly. ExceptAOL. AOL has somehow avoided the label of \"overpriced\" and actuallygarnered several honorable mentions from analysts downgrading otherInternet stocks. Guess where Internet money will go now?For you technicians out there the pendulum has swung fromoverbought to oversold in a very short period of time. The Dowis now down -5222 points in the last five days. Both the Dow andthe Nasdaq have corrected about 5%. Just as the sharp run up lastweek was begging for a dip, this sharp dip is now begging for arally. The big drop today was on the lightest Dow volume in overa week. Not as much conviction today just a lack of buyers. Thiswas also the third triple digit loss in a row. As I mentionedearlier I think the odds for a down day Friday are still prettygood. The wild card again is the options expiration which normallyprovides an upward bias. I can't build a case for a strong moveupward because of Brazil and the holiday but I can see a strongTuesday coming as long as Brazil does not meltdown over the weekend.Earnings will be on us in earnest next week with MSFT, LU, SUNWannouncing along with dozens of others. I think the focus onBrazil will have dimmed and the anticipation of upside surpriseswill take center stage.Good LuckJim BrownMarket Posture***As of Market Close - Thursday, January 14, 1999   Major SupportBroad Market   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***DOW Industrials   9,4000   9,730   9,121   BEARISH   1.14 *SPX S&amp;P 5000   1,2000   1,280   1,212   Neutral   1.12OEX S&amp;P 1000   580   635   601   Neutral   1.12RUT Russell 2000   4000   435   420   Neutral   1.12NDX NASD 1000   1,9000   2,010   1,906   Neutral   1.08MSH High Tech   870   980   931   Neutral   1.08   Major SupportTechnology   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***XCI Hardware   8000   875   836   Neutral   1.08CWX Software   6000   6665   619   Neutral   1.08SOX Semiconductor   360   4000   392   Neutral   1.08NWX Networking   4000   450   427   Neutral   1.08INX Internet   425   570   474   Neutral   1.08   Major SupportFinancial   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***BIX Banking   6660   710   647   BEARISH   1.14 *XBD Brokerage   545   725   638   Neutral   1.14 *IUX Insurance   6000   620   5888   BEARISH   1.14 *   Major SupportOther   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***RLX Retail   8000   860   814   Neutral   1.08DRG Drug   720   795   740   Neutral   1.08HCX Healthcare   710   780   726   Neutral   1.08XAL Airline   310   350   312   Neutral   1.12OIX Oil &amp; Gas   245   260   240   BEARISH   1.14 *Posture AlertAfter tumbling more than 350 points over the past two days, wehave turned BEARISH across the Dow Jones 30 and selectindustry sectors including Banking, Insurance and Oil &amp; Gas.A detailed description of our Market Posture and itsapplications can be found at:ww.optioninvestor.com/marketpostureMarket Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors***Stay Focused on the Pinnacle IndexAfter selling off precipitously over the past couple of days, itis very important to keep in eye on the Pinnacle Index and otherput/call ratios for clues as to whether the sell-off is a majorreversal or profit taking.Based upon the early returns, it appears that most optionspeculators are viewing the sell-off as profit taking and thiscould be prove BEARISH over the near-term.   Despite the negativeeconomic news from Brazil, the Pinnacle Index actually climbedand other put/call ratios indicate increased call buying.Add this to the latest Bullish figures from InvestorsIntelligence (60% Bullish 1/14) you get the impression thatinvestors are ignoring economic and corporate earnings pressures.Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing bearishovertones over the near-term so we advise subscribers totightly protect their long positions.

AfterMonday's earth shaking surge of $71.75, CMGI has dwindledaway 31 points in the last 3 days ($62 pre-split).   Witha host of downgrades raining down on several of the bighitters in the Internet sector, we figure it is time tododge the bullet before some valuation happy analyst setstheir sights on CMGI.   We are cutting CMGI loose andhopefully it's consolidation will be quick.AMZN $138.000 -10.000 (-222.25)   Brazilian devaluation.Analysts' downgrades due to valuation.   Bearish short-termremarks.   Impeachment proceedings.   Option expirations.   Whatelse can we add to the mixture in this pot of volatility???Amazon had been doing just fine when it popped up over +$75.000last week.   Not this week!   On Thursday in a sign of weakness,Amazon finished only two and a half points off its low for theday to close at $138.000.   Even earnings reports from companiessuch as Yahoo that beat estimates weren't enough to carrysympathy plays like Amazon into positive territory.   We aredropping Amazon as a pick.   This is not to say that Amazonwon't turn around- and soon.   But in light of currentcircumstances, we feel there are safer plays to be in.ASND $82.13 +1.81 (+10.69) We finally got the price that LU ispaying for ASND, and it is .825 shares of LU for each share ofASND.   The reason we are dropping ASND is because it haseffectively turned into a LU play since the purchase price hasbeen announced.   There is a little more room for ASND to movegiven the share ratio, but typically the acquiree does notclose the gap completely because of the uncertainty of the dealbeing closed.   There is no hint of competing bids, but ASNDwould be a current play again if a bidding war started for it.SLR $83.56 -1.50(-6.07) We are dropping SLR with the ideawe might pick it back up closer to the earnings report andstock split date. As predicted, SLR announced a 2-1 stocksplit this week. They announced after close on Wednesday.Unfortunately, with the market volatility, SLR went down onthe day. We did see an opening that sent SLR up a few dollars,but this faded into a loss by days end. SLR could definitelysee a split and earnings run, but we feel it's better to waitfor confirmation.JPM   $102.000 4.56 (-12.444) The comeback in financial stockswas derailed this week.   Hammered by the problems in Brazil,JPMorgan lost another $4.56 today.   When we initiated thisplay, JPM had momentum and its chart looked good.   However,it's exposure to Brazil is too great, and given the seriousnessof the political and economic troubles in that country, wehave to drop JPM as a play.GDT   $103.63   3.38 (-3.37) Guidant has lost ground sincesetting an intra-day high of $1119.75 on Monday. With just13 days to go before it splits, GDT should be cruising intoa split run. It tried on Monday, but weakness in the overallmarket has held it back. If the market turns positive again,so will Guidant.   However, with the questionable marketfooting we are going to cut Guidant loose until things firm upPUTS:***NONEPICK NEWS - CALLS***FTL   $17.06 -.06 (-1.444)   FTL was added as a possible takeover play this week.   Something is going on but what?   Weare constantly pouring over news and rumor mongers only todiscover on Wednesday morning wires, trading was halted fora block of shares (73,1000) to trade at $16.06 down $-1.56.Then we read about 1000,000 shares being crossed byGoldman Sachs.   Plus another 1000,000 was traded at $17 todayby Salomon Smith Barney.   Unlike the techs' FTL did not suffer intodays' trading, opening $17.69, taking a little off the tableto $16.69 then closing at $17.06.   Not providing a greatwarm a fuzzy feeling, but enough of a feeling to keep thisas a play.   Remember, rumors are predicting a buyout at $23or more.MYG $63.25 -0.69 (-0.75)   Between Tuesday and Wednesday, MYGseemed to be holding its own and only lost thirty-one centsas the market dropped a combined -270.333 points.   ButBrazilian woes continued and the market plummeted another-2228.63 on Thursday.   Maytag fought and fought but finally,the market scored a point with a knock-down.   Maytag wasstunned and conceded -$0.69.   MYG is normally a strong playand is still one of our split candidates.   But, the marketis extremely volatile and we suggest waiting for things toturn around before starting any new plays.SUNW $94.50 -2.31 (+3.62)   Sun is one of the brightest stockson Wall Street even though the Brazilian storm continues todarken the market.   Sun is up +$3.62 on the week from positivepress releases and rumors of a possible take-over by IBM.   OnWednesday, CNBC presented the rumor which ended up beingdismissed as smoke but option trade volume increased none theless.   We will keep you posted of any changes in the scenario.In other news, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its 12-monthprice target for SUNW to $132, up from the previous price of$104.   Not only does Sun have the only end to end computingplatform used in telecommunications services, it is alsoworking on incorporating its Java technology into the digitalTV industry.   Even though SUNW got ruffled by the market anddropped -$2.31 on Thursday, SUNW is still a strong play.Earnings for the company are scheduled for Jan 21st (not the15th as we had previously reported), a prime time to announcea possible split.   Look at the additional dip as a buyingopportunity but wait for some signs of a turn around beforeentering.   Trying to catch a falling knife tends to damagefingers and trading capital.EMC $93.888 +1.56 (+.31) EMC is a pretty amazing momentum stock.The NASDAQ is down 1.7% today, and EMC goes up.   On Wednesday,EMC's gap down went as low as $84, but it was such a fastmarket it probably was not a price you could have gotteneasily.   During the first 15 minutes of trading on Wednesday1 million shares were traded.   This was almost half ofWednesday's volume, and one-third of EMC's average dailyvolume. There hasn't been any news on EMC, but then again, itdoesn't look like we need any.   FYI   In our Sunday write-up wehad EMC's earnings release date as 1/28, but we have sincelearned that the release date is either 1/25 or 1/26.JBL $71.31 -.69 (-3.56) JBL held up pretty well todayconsidering the action in the market.   I am sure that thecoverage initiated on JBL by Everen Securities helped.   Thepress release did note, however, that in the near-term theybelieve that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long termit should be an outperformer.   The other bit of news thatprobably helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for onestock split.   As we have said on more than one occasion, thisindustry tends to move together, but JBL appears to be theupper crust of a volatile group.UTX $108.56 2.31 (-6.13) UTX is very Dow sensitive.   Let'sillustrate it.   The Dow is down 2.3% today and UTX was down2.1%.   It has been that way all week.   The only thing at thispoint that would probably change UTX's price movement is a pre-earnings announcement one way or the other.   UTX announcesearnings next week.   On the news side, we are amazed at thenumber of varied businesses of UTX.   For example, today UTXannounced that its Hamilton Standard unit signed a letter ofintent to joint venture with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to focuson the maintenance of pneumatic aircraft components.   In thepress release it indicated that it's Hamilton unit also makesspace suits for the NASA shuttle program.   Only play UTX if theDow is moving up.MSFT   $141.75 -$2.06 (-8.13)   Like we said, don't try tocatch a falling knife.   Though, we shrugged off an uglybeginning to finish over 1 point positive yesterday, todaywe gave it back, and then some.   We're still positive onMSFT given their trial has begun to produce positive news,like their appeal of the Judge's decision to force MSFT touse Sun's version of Java in its Windows operating system,and a new stream of MSFT-friendly witnesses on the stand.Furthermore, Prudential Securities said analyst Doug Crookeinitiated coverage of Microsoft Corp. with a rating ofaccumulate and a price target of $175 a share.   MSFT isstill a split candidate at over $140 and will announceearnings January 19 after the close.   We realize thattrading options is inherently risky and caution to wait fora reversal in the stock and the overall market beforestarting another play.   If it falls another day, let itfall.   The point is to catch a good entry on the way up,not on the way down.*** Play updates continued in section two ***FREE TRIAL READERS***If you like the results you have been receiving wewould welcome you as a permanent subscriber.The monthly subscription price is 39.95.

It finishedslightly higher on the day. Today, however, it succumbed tomarket pressure and headed lower with the rest of the chipsector. (We are including PRIA in the chip sector, since itmakes the automation systems that chip makers use in theirclean-room manufacturing operations.) Even though PRIAutomation was lower today, it is still up from its close onTuesday, and that shows a lot more strength than many of theother technology stocks are showing. This stock keeps a lownews profile - it's momentum is what we are watching. Earningsare January 28th.NOKA $145.000 5.000 (+6.38) After rising to a another new 52week high of $1555.38 by mid-day yesterday, Nokia sold off,along with the rest of the market. Today, though, it lost $5.000in a market that saw most of the telecommunication and techstocks sell off sharply.   There was no bad news on Nokia topoint a finger at; investors simply wanted to lock in profitswhen they saw the market moving down.   Nokia is supplying theproducts that will hasten the coming wave of digital datatransmission over mobile phones.   We are playing Nokia bothon momentum, and as a split candidate.Earnings are due out before the open on   January 29th, andthat represents a strong possibility for a split announcement.If it doesn't occur then, we may have to wait until theshareholders meeting at the end of March.(We doubt we'll have to wait for the shareholder meeting.NOKA has unlimited authorization for shares outstanding).DELL Computer $84.19 -1.13 (+5.19)   Pump up the volume!The market got that message in yesterday's action sent Dellup over $3 on 25 million shares.   Average is 19 million.If Microsoft has blowout earnings, Dell is partiallyresponsible and should have big earnings too.   Today, Dellost just $1.13 on 20 million shares; actually a victory inlight of the 70 point loss on the NASDAQ today (rememberDell is the 4th most weighted stock in the NASDAQ 1000).Dell still offering little news.   When they do, the news isbig, though (recently) sometimes unnoticed.   For those withpatience, Dell should ultimately give us one of the betterplays, market willing.   Wait for pullbacks, then the bounceto scale into a position.   Earnings to be announcedFebruary 16th.CSCO - Cisco Systems $101.13 -4.81 (-0.38)   What goes upmust come down, or so the clich goes.   We statedTuesday, \"looking strong, but after 3 days of higherclosings, keep an eye out for the dip\".   Dip happens.   CSCOclosed flat yesterday at $106.13 after rising as high as$109 inter-day, at what looked like would be an excellentweek.   CSCO couldn't hold the new high yesterday and gaveup all of this week's profits on 19 million shares intoday's trading.   No analyst has chosen to downgrade CSCO,but off-handed remarks, like \"overextended\", pop into newsservice comments.   Still an excellent play when fund managersput that 401K cash to work.   Resistance is $108.   Still asplit candidate.   Look for earnings February 2.AOL - America Online $141.000 -7.50 (-5.50)   Whoosh!   That'sthe sound of the rug being pulled from underneath theInternet stocks.   AOL suffered too.   Honestly, it could bea lot worse.   AMZN and YHOO are down approximately 46% and40% respectively from their highs, while AOL's price looksmore like consolidation.   AOL is sitting near its 30 daymoving average and should bounce off it if the internetsector doesn't experience complete meltdown from here.With internets already well off their highs, a lot of airhas now escaped the bubble.   A further huge sell-off is notas likely.   Bottom line:   AOL has rapidly growing realearnings from an outstanding Christmas and is a splitcandidate at these price levels (over $120).   We anticipatea split along with earnings to be announced January 27after 5:000pm ET.   Only 4 trading days left.   We think anearnings run has got to start soon.   Confirm marketdirection backed by strong volume before playing, or targetshoot for a better entry.   Still an Internet; iron stomachand ice in the veins required. [almost every commentatorabout the internet stock meltdown today made an exceptionfor AOL.   They all felt that AOL would comeback and wasthe best play in the entire sector]WCOM - MCIWorldCom $73.888 -3.63 (-1.18)   Not much news toreport, just Brazil/China/Greenspan jitters and profittaking.   We still like WCOM as a fast growinginternet/broadband play.   Big Three long distanceproviders, WCOM included, are winning court battles againstBaby Bells and eating their lunch in the process.   WCOM issitting above support of $72.   Real resistance is at $79.Weighted at number 5 in the NASDAQ 1000 makes WCOM a targetfor fund managers with $9 billion in fresh cash.   Today,Morgan Stanley upped the price target to $95.   Confirmmarket direction before playing.   As we said Tuesday, don'ttry to catch a falling knife if (more) profit taking setsin.T - AT&amp;T $888.06 -3.444 (+3.81)   Tuesday, we cautioned,\"Watch out for profit taking on such a large 1-day run-up,and buy the dip\".   We hope you protected your profits.   Thedip may not yet be over.   AT&amp;T held up relatively well inyesterday afternoon's and today's sell-off by gaining $0.38yesterday and losing only $3.444 today, both on heavyvolume.   This indicates real strength since T was up $7.50in Tuesday's trading - the market could have taken it allback, but didn't.   Though largely forgotten today, AT&amp;T isa big beneficiary of @Home's offer to purchase Excite.Here's why:   @Home's largest shareholder is TCI who isabout to be absorbed into AT&amp;T.   With Excite, AT&amp;T now hasa substantial \"portal\" to the internet which can bedelivered over TCI's cable infrastructure.   Today MorganStanley raised their price target to $105.   Near termresistance is $91.75, it's all-time closing high; $96thereafter.   Wait for market reversal and confirm directionbefore playing.MSFT - Microsoft $158.31 -4.31 (+8.56)   What a day for MSFTon Wednesday in the wake of blow-out earnings; up as muchas $12 to $167.75 inter-day from Tuesday's closing price of$1555.63. Justice Depart or not, MSFT is firing on allcylinders.   Look mom!   No material effect on earnings!Despite giving some back in today's down-draft, fundmanagers can't argue with a 73% earnings increase and willput new cash to work shortly, keeping demand (and volume)high, which should push the price further.   Salomon SmithBarney raised their price target to $2000 while reiteratingtheir \"buy\" rating.   We view this pullback as a buyingopportunity.   As always, confirm market direction beforeplaying.TLAB - Tellabs $84.25 +0.50 (-0.31)   No news again, butwe'll take trading volume with a price increase in the faceof overall market loss any day.   That's what we got withTLAB.   TLAB had a bad day yesterday, giving up a $4 gaininter-day, to close with a loss of $0.888.   Today was adifferent story as TLAB experienced a 21% increase involume with a small gain while the rest of the marketheaded bearishly south.   Since Lucent exceeded earnings,TLAB should have a strong showing too, when they announceafter the closing bell January 25.   We surmise thatLucent's earnings news ($.05 over estimates) coupled withyesterday's dip presented a buying opportunity continuingthe earnings run.   We think it will run further but cautionagainst holding through earnings since, 70% of the time,they fall back after the announcement.   Confirm marketdirection before playingMYG $63.75 -0.19 (-0.50)   Maytag really needs the market tostring a few positive finishes together.   Our rock isweathering.   Its resistance level of $666.000 isn't far away.But, market weakness is making the breakthrough a realchallenge.   Maytag is on our split candidate list andearnings are approaching.   Feb. 4th is the expected date.Wait for market momentum to aid MYG in ascending to newheights before scaling into new plays.SUNW $98.25 -7.13 (-2.19)   Do you want the good news or thebad news first?   We will go with the good news.   As wepredicted, SUNW announced a 2:1 stock split along with it'searnings that beat the street by a penny and crushed lastyear's Q2 number.   Their net income for the second quarteralso increased 222% over last year's results.   The bad newsis profit taking in anticipation of the announcements droppedSUNW -$7.13 on Thursday at a trade volume level that was fourtimes its norm of 6.888 million.   In after hours trading, thestock continued to fall.   As reported by Joe Kernen from CNBC,the additional plunge may have been due to confusion.   Somethought that SUNW would miss the estimates and sold.   In anarticle published just today, their CFO predicted months agonot to expect SUNW to have earnings that beat their firstfiscal quarter.   Others thought that SUNW would crushestimates since they are in such a hot sector.   Built upexpectations led to disappointment in the reality and mayhave contributed to the sell-off.   In any case, SUNW is nowway off its intraday high of $1115.75 hit on Wednesday.   Onceinvestors realize that SUNW is still in great shape, the stockshould resume its upward course.   If the market turns and worksits way uphill again, this pull back could be to our advantageand a great time to buy on the dip.   Wait to see Sun's upwardtrend re-established.LXK $999.888 3.81 (+1.82) LXK held up reasonably well for mostof the day, but couldn't hold on at the end and lost over 3%.LXK will announce earnings before market on Monday the 25th.This date has been confirmed with LXK's investor relations.We feel there is a good chance of a stock split announcement,though there are no guarantees.   For those of you that havewatched the earnings announcements this last week, you haveprobably noticed the punishment many stocks have taken on theannouncement. It seems many have bought the anticipation andwhen a stock fails to beat the expectation, they are beingpunished. This makes holding LXK over earnings a risky play.XIRC $40.75 +.13 (+.87) XIRC held up extremely well todayconsidering the carnage the NASDAQ took.   XIRC traded as highas 41.888 before falling off for a small gain.   XIRC did gapopen on Wednesday, but fell with the market. After announcinggreat earnings on Tuesday, XIRC should continue to trendhigher, market permitting.   XIRC's 10-dma is around $39.000.XIRC option prices should deflate slightly for those interestedin buying in.   This tends to happen after an anticipated eventlike earnings.COF $131.000 4.000 (+.56) COF has held up extremely well incomparison to the market. On Wednesday, COF traded as highas $140 before closing at $135. COF is an example of a stockthat didn't have the huge expectation to blow away earnings.This, in turn, gave COF the opportunity to rise after theearnings announcement. When the market firms, COF shouldcontinue to move higher and should eclipse its high of $140.COF's 10-dma is around $129.000.   COF's sector sidekick PVNdid well today after beating estimates yesterday.ETH $48.75 +.06 (-.19) ETH hasn't done much this week, but didhold strong in a negative market on Thursday.   This strengthwas possibly derived from the statements from the CEO thatthere is a \"tremendous pent-up demand\".   ETH also stated theyare targeting a strategy to have quicker delivery.   This allpoints toward a positive future. ETH is still $18 from its52-week high.PICK NEWS - PUTSAVT $45.50 -.81 (.75) Stock experiencing continued weakness off ofrecent earnings warning.

The deal calls for ATIshareholders to receive 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. Simplemath says it's better to trade the stock that moves point forpoint, not a half for a point. Vodafone's phones are owned by1 in 15 people in the U.K.   The deal with ATI has been applaudedby most, thus the nice run that VOD has had even though it wasthe purchaser. VOD took a dip today and this might present agood buying opportunity. Watch for a direction on Friday.A European official stated that the VOD-ATI merger is a perfectfit. The only problem seemed to be in Germany, where bothcompanies have ownership in competing firms.   VOD has mentionedthey are willing to sell the ownership they have in one ofthe companies.

In the US, QWST is building its InternetProtocol-based fiber-optic network which will connectover 130 cities by mid 1999.The telecom service sector has been on Wall Street's goodside as of late.   U.S. telecommunication companies areexpected to meet or slightly beat estimates due to theincreased demand for phone lines, Internet access, andother phone services.   Qwest is projected to announce itsearnings in three weeks on February 111th.   Even though QWSTwas set back slightly on Thursday in a weak market, we feelQwest has the potential to make a run.   Wait for confirmationof positive movement before positioning yourself for earningsmovement.   [note: Zack's has earnings date as the 111th.QWST's investor relations said they have not released adate yet.]News:   Qwest has recently formed relationships with severalcompanies.

Investors grew cautious inthe trading session when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspanwarned that financial markets were still fragile and a drop in U.S.exports posed a risk to the economy. He said that recent gains instock prices may be difficult to sustain, based on the relativegrowth of corporate profits. The late session sell-off was boostedby computer driven trading programs and some technical selling asthe market dropped through support levels. Strong earnings at MSFThelped push the Nasdaq to a record high. The Nasdaq index closedwith a gain of 7 points after being up 59 points in early trading.The strength of MSFT's earnings was surprising and welcomed news.Our Tuesday spreads were all available near the recommended entrypoints. PTEK was the first of the speculation plays and the debitfor the MAR12C/FEB12C was $0.50. OMPT was the next position andthe MAR15C/FEB15C spread traded near $0.87 debit for much of themorning. Our initial entry was slightly better at $0.81. SCUR wasa bullish debit spread and the FEB20C/25C opened and traded nearthe target price of $3.50. Our position was not quite as good at$3.75. The last position was RHD and although the stock price fell,the debit for the MAR15C/17C bull-call spread remained near $1.12.Other portfolio activities: LEVL shot up almost $3, allowing us totake the early exit at $4.38 credit and a $1.12 profit. PCS alsomoved $3 higher but that won't help us as it is now in danger ofclosing well above the sold strike for this month. Remember, welose our edge (in a calendar spread) when the stock price movessignificantly higher in a short time. Both positions become deepin-the-money with little time value and we have to roll-up to thenext higher strike at the end of the month.Wall Street stocks fell Thursday as fears over the global economyreined in the U.S. bull market. High technology issues suffered asa sell-off in Internet stocks sent the Nasdaq tumbling. The DJIAclosed unofficially down 71 points to 9264.08 and the Nasdaq indexfell 70 points to 23444.89. The Dow had mounted a late rally fromthe day's lows, cutting losses by half, before succumbing to thegeneral malaise. Worries about Brazil, earnings and the tradedeficit got the better of stocks and profit-taking also had anaffect on the downward movement.On Thursday, the spreads portfolio weathered the storm as did mostof us traders. Some of the positions were obvious candidates for\"double-downs\" but none were in danger of being closed-out. Themost significant moves came from AOL, AAPL, and DIS. Although somepositions were down, (SUNW and WCOM) those were actually favorablewhen compared to our \"sold strikes\". Others that survived the dayincluded GM, PCS and OMPT. Hopefully, it will get better tomorrow!NEW PLAYS -Diagonal Spreads - In these plays, the purchased position has alonger maturity than the written option as well as a differentstrike price.

Think for a minute,how much would have heard about the overvalued Internet bubbleif it was never reported on CNBC? I doubt it would even be atopic at the dinner table without their daily \"extensive\"coverage. Don't get me wrong. They do a good job reporting onthe market but they have a negative bias toward these stocks.In any event the leaders all dropped double digit numbers withthe exception of AOL. The largest Internet blue chip, AOL, diddrop as low as -9.50 but had recovered to -$5.000 until themarket drop at the close. It finally settled at -7.50.AOL has firmly established itself as the favorite of analystswho follow this group. With 23,000 new subscribers every dayAOL has power. We view this as a buying opportunity beforenext weeks earnings.The real culprit today was profit taking on worries over theglobal currency problems. Brazil's lower house passed thepension reform law last night but the Bovespa dropped -6% atthe open. The Real lost value again on the open market andstarted putting pressure on other world currencies. The largemarket drop at midday was caused by a rumor that China orHong Kong were going to devalue based on losses in Brazil'scurrency. The rumor was so strong that China made a formalstatement that denied it completely. (remember my commentlast week about never believing anything from any countryunder currency attack. They will say anything to protect theiroptions.) After the denial the market recover significantlyfrom the days lows. Fear of the dark manifested itself withglobal rumors still circulating and profits still on thetable. Another rumor that Greenspan was going to leave officealso put a scare into the markets. Even though the marketholds it's breath every time My G. speaks, they still respectthe work he has done in the last few years.The Nasdaq got hammered. The sixth biggest point loss ever.Down -80 at one time it rebounded in late afternoon to only-38 but when the bottom fell out at the close it sank to -70.Put this in perspective. It had just set another record highyesterday. The Nasdaq was up +215 in the last three weeks.It has been going straight up since the October 8th lows.It was due for a sell off.Chart http:///www.optioninvestor.com/marketwrap/0121nasdaq.gifRemember in the Wednesday commentary on the website we talkedabout the Microsoft gap open on earnings. I warned again aboutholding over earnings and the dire consequences. I advisedwatching LU, IBM and SUNW today for signs of the gap downeffect. The results are in! IBM +2.50 in regular trading,beat the street by +.02, failed to announce a split and tradeddown -7.50 in after hours. Lucent announced earnings that beatthe street by +.04 and issued strong profit forecasts for thenext two quarters. They did fail to announce a split andanalysts felt the current sales were lacking. Lucent dropped-8.56 today after gapping down -6.000 at the open. SUNWannounced after the close and beat the street by +.01 andissued a strong profit forecast AND announced a 2:1 split.SUNW had suffered strong profit taking during the Nasdaqsell off today and was down almost -9.000 at the low of theday. The most active stock on the Nasdaq today with 27 millionshares, SUNW closed at 98.63 in after hours trading, gaining+.38 after the close. Because SUN suffered so much todayand announced a split they did not suffer after hours butcould drop tomorrow. The stock split will help but thetiming is in March, a long way off.The point here is \"everybody beat estimates but IBM and LUgot killed in afer hours and SUNW will probably suffertomorrow.\" It is just not safe to hold over earnings.The S&amp;P Futures dropped -17 points in the last hour of tradingon global worries. Since the close they are only down -.30.If we do not have a negative global currency event overnightthen we could get a strong rebound in the morning. The keyword here is \"could\". We could also suffer another roundof profit taking in front of the weekend. Many traders willwant to get flat before the close so plan your tradesaccordingly.Good LuckJim BrownMarket Posture***As of Market Close - Thursday, January 21, 1999   Key SupportBroad Market   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   AlertDOW Industrials   9,1000   9,730   9,264   Neutral   1.15SPX S&amp;P 5000   1,210   1,280   1,235   Neutral   1.12OEX S&amp;P 1000   6000   635   617   Neutral   1.12RUT Russell 2000   420   435   431   Neutral   1.12NDX NASD 1000   1,9000   2,010   1,962   Neutral   1.21 *MSH High Tech   930   980   958   Neutral   1.21 *   Key SupportTechnology   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***XCI Hardware   830   875   8889   BULLISH   1.19CWX Software   610   6665   648   Neutral   1.21 *SOX Semiconductor   360   410   398   Neutral   1.8NWX Networking   420   450   430   Neutral   1.8INX Internet   470   570   473   Neutral   1.8   Key SupportFinancial   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***BIX Banking   650   710   658   Neutral   1.15XBD Brokerage   630   725   6661   Neutral   1.14IUX Insurance   590   620   582   BEARISH   1.21 *   Key SupportOther   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***RLX Retail   8000   860   820   Neutral   1.8DRG Drug   740   795   745   Neutral   1.8HCX Healthcare   720   780   7222   Neutral   1.8XAL Airline   310   350   310   Neutral   1.12OIX Oil &amp; Gas   245   260   240   BEARISH   1.14Posture AlertAfter selling off at an important benchmark, we have turnedNeutral on the hot Technology sector and Bearish on theInsurance sector after breaking below it 50-day movingaverage.

Are you Fearless Buying the Dip?Are any of your long positions unprotected?   If you answered yesto any of these questions, you are among the growing number whowill feel the sting of the next market sell-off.Many of our trusted sentiment indicators are suggesting that if asell-off materializes, the general investing community will haveNO fear of buying the dip, particularly after the favorableexperience of last October's strong and profitable advance.   Butif the rallies DON'T hold, most investors won't recognize thetrap until it's too late.Write these numbers down and commit them to memory.Dow Jones Industrial Average / 9,4000Market Volatility (VIX) / 30.0%First, If the Dow Jones Industrial average has trouble gettingback over 9,4000, begin developing a balanced attack and buildsome hedge positions.   The market broke into record territory inthe first week of January on strong volume, yet failed to holdthe gain.   This is a bearish development.Next, the Market Volatility Index (VIX) is a powerful short-termsentiment indicator that will help presage what will happen nextin the market.   The VIX closed Thursday at 31.95 - above the 50day moving average.   Everyday above 30% means that the recentdeclining trend on the VIX has been broken.Pinnacle Capital Advisors was among the first advisory firm toalert investors that the VIX had violated a key benchmark onMonday, January 111, 1999 which preceded the 145 point sell-offthe next day.   Pinnacle believes that this action marked thenear-term top.The final straw will be the value of our Pinnacle Index on theS&amp;P 1000 (OEX) and S&amp;P 5000 (SPX).   If these begin to climb, itmeans that option speculators are ignoring early warning signsand buying excessive out-of-the-money call options believing that the market will reach higher levels.   This is when savvy andexperienced investors will know its time to go to cash and getshort.Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing BEARISHovertones over the near-term so we advise subscribers totightly protect their long positions.

Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.We drop a pick because something happened to change itsprofile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because wedon't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who areunfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and wewant them to look at any current pick as a valid play.CALLS:***QCOM $59.50 2.50 (-4.38) Go figure.   QCOM announces greatearnings and beat estimates, and then trades down after theannouncement.   The downgrade QCOM received Wednesday morningcertainly didn't help the situation.   A weak market today addedto the losses.   Since the run into the earnings announcementwasn't followed through, we are going to drop QCOM as a pick.DIS $34.56 1.444 (-1.444) We picked up Disney last weekbecause of its multiple upgrades and because it had becomea bit of an Internet play with its GO Network portal sitelaunch.   Unfortunately, Disney came late to the party inthe Internet game. The internets have been selling off allweek, and analysts are talking about the bubble bursting.Although Disney hit $36.000 today, it ended the day at only$34.56 - down $1.444. We are dropping it for lack ofperformance.YHOO $265.000 222.19 (-52.000) It doesn't seem that YHOO isready to reverse paths as of yet.   We just don't see anynews pending that will possibly start YHOO up again otherthan its stock split coming up.   This could change at anytime, but a few internet earnings announcements of late havejust met estimates and this just isn't enough to keep thesestocks afloat.   We'll watch for a reversal and possibly addYHOO back when the split run starts, if everCHKPF $40.25 -4.75 (-111.000) Watch out below!!!   CHKPF is beingdropped.   CHKPF met earnings estimates on the 20th.   This justdidn't cut it.   CHKPF has a history of destroying earningestimates and this just took the wind out of their sails.   Thecompany also sees 1Q revenues in the single digits.   Thoughthis may be an extreme sell-off, the near term prospects justdon't seem positive.   CHKPF hopefully didn't catch any of youoff guard when it moved it's earnings announcement up a day.LU $106.94 -8.56 (-3.31) We can't seem to get this one right.We have decided to drop LU in case the big drop today wasmore than an over reaction.   LU announced earnings before theopen today and beat analyst estimates by a nickel, thenproceeded to go down close to $9. Go figure.   It seems thatinvestors are concerned about the addition to income becauseof some accounting issues with the pension play.   What peopleare failing to realize is that this practice was figured intothe estimates and also caused LU to show better earnings inthe past to keep up with competitors accounting methods.   Wefeel it's too risky to guess on this falling knife.   For thosethat like LU, waiting for a bounce off the bottom could bevery profitable.ATI $94.13 3.75 (+10.75) Since ATI's price is basicallycontingent on the price of VOD, we have decided to drop ATIand pick VOD. ATI will increase approximately 1/2 of what VODincreases.   We feel ATI is a still a good play, so don't sellcurrent holding in ATI just because we are dropping it.   Wejust feel we might as well get more bang for the buck.PUTS:***NONEPICK NEWS - CALLS***UTX $1113.94 +1.94 (+4.25) UTX reported earnings today of $1.16per share which beat the estimates of $1.111 per share.   Thisrepresented an 18% increase above the same quarter a year ago.Strong showings in its aircraft and refrigeration businesseswere factors in the increase.   What probably helped the stockmore than the earnings announcement was UTX saying that it hashired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for itsautomotive components business.   The automotive componentsbusiness is consolidating, operating profits are falling andrevenues are flat.   The Street liked that announcement.   Afterthe gap up this morning, UTX traded down in what looked likeprofit taking.   We would wait for some upward movement beforeinitiating any new tradesCCU $60.000 -$4.25 (-$0.43)   Well now everyone is gettinginto the act. CCU announced this week, they had opened uptheir 3D interactive mall which allows shopping fromyour desktop for just about anything. Actually, it is notreally CCU, but National Media.   National Media is ownedby Jacor who in turn is merging with CCU.   So in an indirectway, CCU has got it's own Internet play.   They expect 15,000stores to join them.   The difference in their mall comparedto the others is, each store is downloadable separately,saving disc space on your PC and your time at the mall.You will stroll into the mall, go to the store of choice,pull an item from the shelf and purchase it on line.Weakness in today's market didn't help us take any bigsteps up again, but CCU showed strength anyway.   CCU opened atits high of $63.50, dropping to $59.000.   The rest of themarket held it back and made it rest on it's support at aclose of $60.000 for the day.F $62.06 -2.63 (+$0.06) Ford announced it's earnings today,nearly a 7% rise in 4th Qtr earnings.   F posted its 111thconsecutive quarter of beating the street estimates andreporting earnings of $1.35 a fully diluted share.   Up from$1.6 billion or $1.27 a share a year ago. Ford says, theymore than doubled their cost cutting goal by reducing costsby $2.2 billion last year.   Ford's operating profit was up10%, this means about 160,000 U.S. employees will receiveprofit sharing checks averaging $6,1000 on March 3rd.   Stocksdid close generally lower today and F was no exception.   Fopened at $64.000 just below it's high of $64.31 finished offof it's low of $61.56 to $62.06.   We may see a continued uptrend after the market digests the figures and regains it'smomentum.FTL $17.81 -$0.31 (+1.13) What is going on with FTL?   We'reasking the same question. Wednesday's and Thursday's calloptions again, showed signs of increased volatility.   Sometake over plays happen over night, and others want to teaseyou into doing something rash.   We peeked in on the insidertrading and found none to speak of.   In some cases theprinciples are advised not to do anything that would castsuspicion, one way or the other if something is in theworks.   On todays' trading, FTL had a good open at $18.25,clawed its way to $18.75 amidst a downturn in the S&amp;P andsettled at $17.81 for the close. Be careful, with a weakmarket, even if this is a takeout, it could be postponedfor a better time and price.EMC $96.000 4.000 (-4.06) EMC set a new 52 week high onWednesday, and then started trading down.   It tried to recovertowards the end of the day today, but to no avail.   In thenews, Staples, the world's largest operator of officesuperstores, announced that they have standardized their datastorage needs on an EMC system.   The reasons they gave were tomore effectively manage rapid business growth, reduceinformation management costs, and improve customer service.   Wehave done some more research into EMC announcing a split withearnings next week, and it doesn't appear likely.   They do nothave enough shares authorized and their shareholder meeting isnot expected until April.   Repeat   No split announcementwith earnings.MU $69.81 3.19 (-1.50) Almost the entire tech sector wasdown today.   Intel, Texas Instruments, and Micron Technologyall lost ground.   ALTR suffered from two downgrades, eventhough it's earnings beat consensus estimates, and that helpedpull the sector lower.   Even upgrades today on both TXN andMU did not help these stocks.   Warburg Dillon Read raised MUfrom hold to buy.   It's analyst, Gregory Mischou, upped his1999 earnings estimate to $.12 from a loss of $.111, and hisfiscal 2000 forecast from $1.95 to $2.31. He believes MUcould trade up into the mid-90s in the current market. Intel,which has already invested in MU, has just established arelationship with Samsung, and may do so with Hyundai as well.It wants to insure Direct Rambus DRAM production in thefuture, and hopes to expand cooperation in the next-generationmemory chip industry.   The Koreans have been drasticallycutting production.   The chip sector is still recovering froma dismal year, and its turn-around is showing up in increasingchip stock prices. They may trend lower with the Internetstocks.   However, confirm upward movement in the sector andin MU before initiating new plays. Current quarter ends inFebruary.JBL $73.13 -.06 (-.75) JBL actually held up pretty well today.As we discussed on Tuesday, its chart is starting to flatten,and it looks like its momentum is slowing.   JBL's 3, 10, and 21day moving averages have all converged at this point.   A lot oftimes a momentum stock will base for a period, and then startits move again.   Wait for confirmation of upward movementbefore initiating any new trades.*** Play updates continued in section two ***FREE TRIAL READERS***If you like the results you have been receiving wewould welcome you as a permanent subscriber.The monthly subscription price is 39.95.

Profit taking andweakened markets set Sun back only -$1.19 on Wednesday.   OnThursday, SUN heated up again and added $3.888 to finish justoff its high for the day.   Merrill Lynch raised its pricetarget to $130 and maintained its buy rating on the company.In the news recently, Sun Microsystems, Lucent, Cisco, andNetwork Associates have joined forces to form the SecurityResearch Alliance.   This Alliance will be committed tohelping organizations increase the security of theirdesktops and networks.   Look for SUNW to head higher ifthe markets can stay the color of money.VIA.B $85.000 +2.13 (+2.444)   After profit taking took its tollon the stock on Tuesday, VIA.B turned it right around.   It hassteam rolled ahead another +$2.888 since Wednesday.   Some morearticles have surfaced on the topic of VIA.B's earnings dueon February 25th.   The consensus seems to be that they willbe better than last year's loss of 29 cents a share.   One ofSG Cowen &amp; Co's analysts thinks they could come in at +0.16a share.   Some of Viacom's productions have been popular withviewers.   The movie \"Varsity Blues\" and the TV programs\"Becker\" and \"Dilbert\" are all getting nice ratings.   Watchfor VIA.B to keep up its forward progress.WAG $60.25 +1.13 (+1.81)   WAG took advantage of the volatilityin the markets on Thursday and added +$1.31.   Walgreen's islooking good and if the markets can positive, look for WAG'suptrend to continue.   It is splitting it's stock 2:1 onFeb. 12th.LXK $1110.31 +1.000 (+111.06) LXK continues to be a strongperformer.   A gain of $1.000 today in a good market is onething, but a gain of $1.13 on Wednesday was very impressive.For the last three trading days LXK has reached an intradayhigh.   The new high is now $111.888.   We still see a stocksplit in LXK's future, but at this time a probable date isnot known.   Most likely an announcement would come as aresult of a special board of directors meeting.   We'll keepyou updated.VOD $197.63 +4.000 (+10.25) VOD had a great day on Thursday.For the 4th time in 5 days, VOD closed at its high of theday.   The merger between ATI and VOD is still a go and toinsure the tax-free status of the merger, ATI has filed fora private-letter ruling.   This is a ruling the IRS givesATI to insure the tax-free status of the merger.   Bothcompanies feel that even if a private letter ruling isn'tgiven in the positive, they can achieve the status theydesire.   This issue has been part of the cause for thediscrepancy of the offer and the current prices.XIRC $45.000 +1.13 (+3.000) XIRC continues to move upward.   Onebullish sign on Thursday was the push and hold above theprior high of $444.50.   We are in new high territory and seeno reason, other than profit taking, that should keep thisstock from heading higher.   No recent news on XIRC, butthe stock has outperformed the communications industry ata nice margin over the last couple of weeks.   XIRC's PEratio is also lower than the industry average.SNC $40.25 +.69 (+2.50) SNC continued to rise today, reachingan intraday high of $40.63.   SNC is still $12 below its 52-week high.   With a PE ratio below the industry average, SNCstill has room to move toward prior highs.   Earnings are ina few weeks and, market permitting, should see an earningsrun.   The last 7 earning surprises have been: 4,9,111,6,15,333,and 14%.XLNX $83.50 +3.69 (+5.32) XLNX has been on a yo-yo the lastweek or so.   The bottom line is that XLNX is yo-yoing its wayup.   On Wednesday, XLNX fell just under $3, but came backstrong with a gain of $3.69 on Thursday.   Even with all theday up and day down movement, XLNX is still up over $5 on theweek.   With the stock split not until March, we are likelyto see times of consolidation.   This most likely occur whenthe NASDAQ itself decides to rest.   Watch for pullbacks.XLNX's CEO did state that the past quarter earnings did exceedexpectations.   This should lead to a nice continued uptrend.PICK NEWS - PUTS***AMR - $54.50 1.25 (-.75) Airline Index (XAL) still tradingbelow 50 day-moving average.

This news went over well with CLX investorsas CLX traded as high as $124.38.

The mainfocus of the Thursday meeting could be the current high level ofstock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 124points at at 9,2000. Technology stocks, the stalwart group in manyrecent sessions despite softer prices in most other sectors of themarket, also faded and this despite a good morning session put inby the Internet issues. The performance of the broader market hasalso been a sore spot among market technicians for quite some timeand Wednesday's poor showing only added fuel to those concerns.Our Tuesday plays were a raucious group. MSFT opened higher withmost of the technology stocks but eventually it fell back and justa little patience allowed traders to achieve the suggested creditof $1.50 for the (MAR1555P/160P) bull-put spread. DELL was alsohigher in the morning and some of you had to wait until a fewminutes after 10 AM for the correct entry price of $0.81 on theMAR65P/70P credit spread. XRX was stable most of the day and thethe calendar position (MAR120C/FEB120C) was available more thanonce at $2.87 debit and the lowest I saw was $2.75. IBM was thebig mover and although we expected a pull-back, $7 was a bit much.We started the play (MAR175C/185C debit spread) with a reducedentry price of $5.50 but by the end of the day the spread was downto $4.50 so we decided to double-up, reducing our overall positionto a nice round number. Those of you playing the spread couldeasily better our position, but that doesn't mean it won't fallfurther tomorrow. Eventually, we think IBM will make the split runto the $180-$190 range...Lets hope so!BGP appears destined to fall well short of our long position inFebruary. After this week, we will no longer track the calendarspread and just be thankful that the debit spread had a positiveoutcome. SRCM continued lower but did not reach our target exit.The goal is still $1.000 for the FEB15P but with time running out,we make take the small profit soon. The JMED straddle started toshow some activity the last few days. Any continued downwardmovement may help us exit the bearish side of the play shortly.Thursday, January 28U.S. stocks rallied Thursday as Internet mania propelled the techissues. Two mergers AOL's positive earnings helped the market movehigher. Yahoo!'s planned purchase of GeoCities and Intel's stocksplit drove investors to a buying frenzy in the technology arena.The incredible performance by the technology sector lifted broadmarket averages to hearty gains in the process. The DJIA ended up81 points at 9281.333. But the Nasdaq composite index was again thestory of the day, rising 70 points to a record 24777.333. Observerscontinued to express concern over the deficient breadth of themarket's advance of late, but most weren't ready to turn outrightnegative on U.S. shares and Greenspan may have put the icing onthe cake when he said that Internet stocks, despite their highvaluations, might have their place in the bull market.AOL, CTXS, DELL, EMC and SEPR were our big movers and even IBMfinished positive. LVLT is now approaching the exit target butSRCM continued to hang-on with today's rally. Stocks that areapproaching downside limits include RDRT and SCUR. We will keepa close eye on these plays. Shares of Centocor climbed past $444after the company said fourth-quarter profit rose to 14 cents ashare before charges, exceeding the average estimate of analysts.For those of you interested in the butterfly roll-out, today'smove allowed an easy exit from the bullish part of the spread;APR35C/45C for a credit of $3.50. Now the plan would require thestock price to fall enough so that the APR45C/40C can be boughtfor less than $2.62 (the current cost basis). Butterfly spreadsare an excellent neutral strategy and they have more flexibilitythan a straddle.***   - NEW PLAYS -***INTC - Intel $137.19   *** More Splits ***INTC designs, manufactures and markets microcomputer componentsand related products at various levels of integration.

Re your reference to UK laws on Equity Trading, I assume that you are referring to the proposed Equity Trading facility in London;   I trust that   you also received my detailed e-mail on that topic of yesterday evening.   Please note that I have now received a fax from Alan Aronowitz with the Houston trading policy (containing Chinese Wall information), to which I refer in that e-mail - I shall be considering the sufficiency of that policy for UK purposes later today. Re your request for advice on the extraterritorial effect of the U.S securities' laws, this is a new question which we have been asked to look at.   In my view, there will be some extraterritorial effect of such laws on the activities.   I have also discussed this issue with Scott Sefton who has provided me with a general overview on this, noting particularly the U.S. Insider Dealing laws and potential U.S. reporting and disclosure of interests' requirements; however, Scott has suggested that we retain external U.S. counsel for in-depth advice on this, with which I agree.If you agree that we should instruct external counsel on this issue, I would be more than happy to deal with this from London;   please let me now which external counsel you would wish to use.   In my and Scott's views, we should use expert   \"SEC\"-knowledgeable counsel in New York, such as either Cravath, Cadwallader, Davis Polk, Cleary's, etc.Please just let me know - I would be able to instruct external counsel today, get an estimate of their time for dealing with the US aspect and report back immediately.   Kind regardsMark \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   Mark E Haedicke   02/02/999 10:32 PM To: Mark Elliott/LON/ECT@ECT, Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Trading German and Spanish listed equities from Houston - second e-mail   Mark:   We also need to look at the UK laws regarding equity trading and what the extraterritiorial reach is of the US sec;urities laws.   Please   copy Mark Taylor on this matter as well.   Please give me a time frame on when we will have answers to these questions.   Thanks.   Mark Haedicke\n"

The broader markettook all day to catch up.After another night passed without a global meltdown themarket got off to a cautious start this morning. The Dowtraded in a narrow range until a small dip at noon but thedip appeared to be the signal for buyers to come off thesidelines.The techs jumped out to a quick lead and the Nasdaq hoveredin the high +30 range for what seemed like forever but thenfinally surged to another record close.The combination of strong earnings reports and multiplestock splits powered the market forward. As soon as traderssaw the market was not going down after the bump at the openthey jumped in not wanting to be left behind.IBM surprised no one when they announced a 2:1 split.MCD also announced a 2:1 and joined the recent ranks ofother splitters MSFT and XRX who announced yesterday.The stock split craze is not over yet. BRCM and EBAY bothannounced splits after the close. EBAY a 3:1 and BRCM 2:1.It appears that nothing can stop MSFT as it added 9.69today (they are over +15 for the week).   After such astrong move, we are looking for some kind of pullback.The rest of the Nasdaq 1000's top four did well too.INTC rose 6.31 while CSCO jumped up 3.69 and DELL leapedup another 3.63.   Definitely a good day for the techs.Not to be outdone, AOL added $9.000 in anticipation oftheir own earnings announcement tomorrow.   Odds of asplit are strong but there is always an increasedrisk associated with holding over earnings.   It wouldn'tsurprise us to some profit taking before the closetomorrow (quite similar to what happened to SUNW theday of their earnings).Compaq Computer announced today that they were going tospin off Alta Vista as a separate company. This positivenews fired up the Internets early in the day.As if they needed to add any fuel to the Internet explosionAmazon announced earnings (or lack thereof) that beat thestreet by +.04. That along with the EBAY and BRCM splitshad all the parties celebrating after the bell. EBAY wasup +18 and AMZN +7 in after hours. No numbers were availablefor BRCM.The market internals were negative until the last hour.It just seemed that the buyers were holding back and onlyreluctantly moving back into the market like swimmers inthe ocean after a shark sighting. Everyone KNEW theyshould be buying but they wanted someone else to go first.The fear of being Greenspamed on Thursday was probablyweighing on some and lingering Brazil/China worries onothers. The market is still a little top heavy here afterthe big run in recent weeks. Yes we backed off -5000 pointsbut some say this was not enough. We have always expectedthe better than expected earnings would have tradersre-evaluating their estimates for 1999. Now it appearsthat the current S&amp;P average of companies reporting isa +6.3% year over year increase in earnings. The historicalaverage is around +7% but due to the global slowdown thecurrent estimates had been for only +5% growth.With almost 50% of the S&amp;P-5000 already reported we areseeing a better than 2:1 ratio of positive surprisescompared to negative surprises.We could have some profit taking again Wednesday nightas fear of Greenspan takes hold but we feel that he willnot harm the market intentionally. Almost nothing can harmthis market. Sure there will be some dips but for the nexttwo weeks the trend should be up. After the two up daysthis week we could actually see some drop at the open againtomorrow as minor profit taking occurs.Good LuckJim Brown***The OEX Skybox is Back - New &amp; Improved***Based upon subscriber demand, the OEX Skybox is coming back.OptionInvestor.com is please to announce that PinnacleCapital Advisors will be bringing its popular OEX Skybox backto OI's advisory website this weekend and updating it DAILY.And what better day to bring the OEX Skybox back than onSuperbowl Sunday, January 31st.

Thissuggests that we DO NOT have strong underlying sentiment supportNext, we are focused on Call activity, particularly followingfavorable earnings reports and stock splits.   If the optionsspeculators get ahead of themselves, it could presage a nearterm top.One positive development is the Market Volatility Index(VIX) has closed BELOW 30.0% (29.35%).   This has Bullish overtones especially if the VIX resumes its declining trend which began back on October 8th.Other sentiment indicators are still flashing BEARISHovertones over the near-term including the InvestorsIntelligence survey (60% Bullish) so we advise subscribers totightly protect their long positions.

Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.We drop a pick because something happened to change itsprofile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because wedon't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who areunfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and wewant them to look at any current pick as a valid play.CALLS:***AMGN $1112.75 1.444 (-1.888) Amgen is an example of a stock thatshould have been bought using the target shooting approach.If you tried target shooting, you may have been filled in theearly morning and wound up with a profitable trade.   Amgen wasdown nearly $4.000 in the first hour of trading Monday. In themiddle of the day, it climbed back to hover around $1114.000until the close. Today the trend was down again until late inthe day, when buyers moved in to buy the dip, but still leftit lower on the day. While the Nasdaq is up strong, Amgen isnot performing the way we had hoped, so we are dropping it.However, there is the possibility of a split announcementwith earnings.   Unfortunately, there is more than one earningsdate available for AMGN.   Some sources say Jan. 27th otherssay Jan. 28th.   AMGN last split 2:1 in August of 19995 in themid-90s.T $86.888 -2.75 (-1.37)   Earnings announcement (metexpectations), share buyback, stock split, TCI merger ---the news is already out.   Right now, there's not much leftto move AT&amp;T higher.   To be good plays, we think almost twotimes a company's normal volume should produce nice gains.Instead, over the last 2 days, AT&amp;T went down in a strongupward market.   In short, the play looks over for now sowe are dropping AT&amp;T.QWST $56.13 -2.56 (-4.000)   QWST has shown some weakness sofar this week.   It dove -$4.000 even in a market that seemsto be moving upwards.   On Tuesday, Lehman Brothers cut itsrating to outperform from their previous buy recommendation.They think competition will increase from other companieslike MCI WorldCom Inc. and AT&amp;T.   By taking a look at theirchart, it is easy to see that QWST is on the downside of thehill. We are dropping Qwest as one of our plays until itmakes a definite turn-around and regains some upwardmomentum.PRIA $32.19 -.81 (-3.69) PRIA gave us a good, steadymomentum run.   But earnings are only 2 days away, and itlooks like it is rolling over and heading lower, so we aredropping it.   Remember, we don't recommend holding overearnings due to the increased risk.   Make your own decisionbased on your risk/reward profile.PUTS:***MCHP - $32.000 1.25 (1.81)   Stock recovered nearly $2 afterbeing downgraded by Alex Brown.

Dropping until stock rollsover again.PICK NEWS - CALLS***EMC $101.75 -.25 (+3.25) EMC announced earnings today and beatestimates by 2 cents per share.   Revenue for the quarterincreased 36% over the year ago period and net income increased54% versus the same period last year.   EMC also projectsrevenue growth in 1999 to be 30% or more and sales to pick upin Asia.   Software revenues grew by 175%.   EMC traded down onlya little today, which is good news since they didn't blow awaythe estimates.   EMC still has some room to move before it runsinto the 52 week high it set last week.UTX $1117.25 +1.444 (+2.69) UTX set a new 52 week high today at$1117.63.   The downgrade that UTX got after the close on Fridayreally didn't impact it all that much.   UTX traded flat for thefirst half of Monday and then started up.   We haven't had anynews on UTX so it is living off of its earnings release lastweek and the upward movement of the Dow.   Remember when tradingUTX, it is a Dow 30 component and is very Dow sensitive.ORCL $52.888 +1.81 (+3.000) We said ORCL might be a candidate forsome target shooting around its 10 day moving average, but ithasn't been anywhere near it this week.   It was good to seeORCL move through $52 today.   It had been having some troublewith this level.   In the news, ORCL announced new software foroil exploration and production companies.   It will allow oilindustry co-venture partners and newly merged oil companies toshare information and monitor asset performance assetperformance quickly, easily and collaboratively.   The oilindustry can use all the help they can get given the low priceof oil these days.   The new software uses ORCL's new Internetdatabase   Oracle8i.DELL $888.50 +3.63 (+5.50)   Without news orfanfare, Dell set a new all-time closing high today onslightly less than average volume, indicating a lack ofsellers.   Dell is now sitting at its resistance of $888.50.If Dell can push through this on more than 18 millionshares, the sky is the limit on its way to earningsscheduled for February 16 after the close.   If volumedoesn't materialize, that's OK.   It just means that Dellwill be a little more susceptible to a pullback.   InTechnology Business Research's 4th Quarter Corporate ITBuying Behavior and Customer Satisfaction Study, conductedwith 3000 F1000 IT Managers, Dell continues as the numberone vendor for customer satisfaction across notebook,desktop and server platforms.   Nice chart; its not too lateto scale into a position for earnings.   Dips are buyable,but would rather confirm upward movement first.CSCO $107.13 +3.69 (+4.32)   Thank goodnessfor the last hour of trading.   Without it, CSCO would be uponly $2 this week; not very inspiring considering CSCO isthe third largest component of the NASDAQ 1000, which set anew high today.   Cisco's saving grace: genuine buyinginterest (not just market sympathy) shows volume 111% aboveaverage in today's trading.   We are playing CSCO as a splitcandidate and earnings run.   CSCO has enough sharesauthorized to announce a 3:2 split on February 2 after theclose, along with earnings, just 5 trading days away.   CSCOcontinues receive new awards for building the new wave oftelecom technology.   Today, CSCO was selected as Sprint'sprimary supplier of DSL technology for building out \"lastmile\" broadband access solutions to Sprint's next-generation Sprint ION(SM), Integrated On-Demand Network,and for DSL-based services for customers of Sprint's LocalTelecommunications Division (LTD), beginning in 1999(Business Wire).   The run has begun.   Dips are buyable.Confirm upward movement first and use stops to protect yourprofits.AOL $154.84 +8.84 (+14.40)   Whew!!!   All wecan say is \"It's about time\".   In Sunday's letter, we notedthat we expected a bounce off the moving average, out ofconsolidation running toward earnings.   We got it.   Volumehas been slightly below average this week causing us slightanxiety.   But with a 14-point gain in 2 days, we'll getover it.   Tomorrow, after 5:000 p.m. ET, AOL announcesearnings along with what we also hope to be a splitannouncement; probably 2:1, although there are enoughshares outstanding to declare a 3:1.   We expect greatresults from the record number of new subscribers andsurprising Holiday sales volumes. We don't normallyrecommend holding over earnings so evaluate your risktolerance if you opt to hold through on this play.Intestinal fortitude still required.WCOM $777.94 +0.25 (+3.06)   WCOM should haveperformed better today given the new NASDAQ record, butwe're still up $3 for the week under it's resistance levelof $80 on slightly higher than average volume.   To be safe,wait for a pullback confirmed by reversal, or until WCOMbreaks $80 and holds.   The U.S Supreme Court's rulingyesterday to force the baby bells to open their markets tocompetition had little effect on moving the price up.   Adowngrade issued by Kauffman Bros. from \"buy\" to \"hold\"didn't help.   Confirm sector movement before starting a newplay.*** Play updates continued in section two ***FREE TRIAL READERS***If you like the results you have been receiving wewould welcome you as a permanent subscriber.The monthly subscription price is 39.95.

This wasa significant premium over the current stock price but whenyou are an Internet stock this could be a one day move.Rumors are flying that Compaq is preparing to make a majorInternet purchase maybe as early as tomorrow. Lycos is themost mentioned possible target.This Internet mania helped power the Nasdaq to another recordclose and is credited with pulling the Dow out of anothervaluation worry induced profit taking session. How can yoube bearish about the market in general when the tech stocksare continuing to beat earnings estimates and blow away whispernumbers.Microsoft announced after the close and showed just how bigthe $5 bln gorilla really is. The $5 bln was sales for lastquarter. MSFT announced $.73 vs estimates of $.59 and blewaway the whisper number of $.62. Microsoft was trading up +5.000after the close. There was no split announcement and this couldbe attributed to the trial publicity. They don't want to appeartoo prosperous for the penalty phase. The conference call wastypically pessimistic as they tried to keep a lid on analyst'sestimates for the future. I would expect MSFT to gap open onWednesday.The futures are up +6.50 at 7:10 ET and we give the credit toMSFT and several other announcements after the bell. The flyin the ointment could be the Alan Greenspan testimony tomorrowin Washington. He is sure to be asked some \"irrational exuberance\"type questions and the answers could be earth shaking. Someanalysts say Mr. G. has been criticized so severely by congressfor his previous market moving performances that future commentswill likely be constrained. Don't bet the farm on this. Alanis tasked with many insurmountable projects one of which iskeeping the U.S. markets under control. The recent Internet\"froth\" is something that other Fed governors have pointed atin the past as a sign of a speculative bubble. So even thoughthe futures are up now, we may see some weakness before thetestimony. If we get by without any earthquake comments thenthe week could continue up strongly. The Brazil problem couldeven be a muzzle for Mr. G. Better to be quiet than roil themarkets and have to lower rates again next month to rescue themagain.Clinton gets a major play tonight with the televised State ofthe Union speech. He is under a strong spotlight as people lookfor signs of cracks in the presidential armor. What should he do?Pull out some heavy firepower! He is planning just that. Clintonwill unveil his support for a plan to take some Social Securityfunds and put them into the market in a retirement savings accountprogram. Estimates in the $5000-7000 bln range are being tossedabout. This is not a new concept but his support for this popularplan is new and timely given the other problems he is facing.Maybe we should keep his feet to the fire longer if he is goingto do us favors like this. Not only would I rather my SocialSecurity was gaining ground in an account of this style but canyou imagine the market impact of a $7000 bln inflow of cash?Don't count your chickens yet but stay tuned for plan detailsif it is ever approved. Opponents claim losses could occur ifa long term bear market were to appear.I got considerable email about the 10% plan in Sunday's commentary.Some good and some bad. Most of the good came from traders thatstarted putting this type of plan into action several months agowhen I wrote about it last. Most of them have multiplied theiraccounts by several hundred percent. The negative mail seemed tocome from readers that were new to the newsletter and had smallaccounts and were adamant that you should only settle for 2000-3000%returns on every trade. We will see what kind of mail I get severalweeks from now when we start publishing the results from the readerswho are going to implement the plan. I had many readers email thatthey were going to faithfully try it and report back. Good Luck!The first ten who can show ten trades will win a years subscription.Anybody can still play. Just send a recap of your completed playsafter 1/17/999 using the 10-20% plan from Sundays newsletter.This is going to be an interesting week. Keep your options openand make those trades. With the put/call ratio at .42 and theadvances only barely beating the declines 1506/1492, we are notout of the woods yet. Tommorrow could be another record breakerfor the Nasdaq but the broader market internals are still weak.Just three stocks in the Dow accounted for over +60 points today.T +7.75, IBM +7.06, GM +4.69. The odds are real good that thesestocks will not be the leaders tomorrow and new leaders are hardto find. Without these huge gains today we would have been verynegative. -46 without accounting for the positive impact theyhad on other Dow components. Keep your fingers crossed.Good LuckJim BrownMarket Posture***As of Market Close - Tuesday, January 19, 1999   Key SupportBroad Market   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***DOW Industrials   9,1000   9,730   9,3555   Neutral   1.15SPX S&amp;P 5000   1,210   1,280   1,252   Neutral   1.12OEX S&amp;P 1000   6000   635   623   Neutral   1.12RUT Russell 2000   420   435   431   Neutral   1.12NDX NASD 1000   1,9000   2,010   2,030   BULLISH   1.19 *MSH High Tech   930   980   9991   BULLISH   1.19 *   Key SupportTechnology   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***XCI Hardware   830   875   897   BULLISH   1.19 *CWX Software   610   6665   687   BULLISH   1.19 *SOX Semiconductor   360   410   402   Neutral   1.8NWX Networking   420   450   4448   Neutral   1.8INX Internet   470   570   534   Neutral   1.8   Key SupportFinancial   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***BIX Banking   650   710   6663   Neutral   1.15XBD Brokerage   630   725   6664   Neutral   1.14IUX Insurance   590   620   596   Neutral   1.15   Key SupportOther   /Resistance   Last   Posture/Since   Alert***RLX Retail   8000   860   8222   Neutral   1.8DRG Drug   740   795   752   Neutral   1.8HCX Healthcare   720   780   730   Neutral   1.8XAL Airline   310   350   3331   Neutral   1.12OIX Oil &amp; Gas   245   260   242   BEARISH   1.14Posture AlertAfter advancing into record territory and holding, we have turnedBULLISH across select technology sectors including NASD 1000,hardware and software.

Already, the horses are off and running.On Tuesday, Sun added +$4.888 to set another all time high inintraday trading at $105.444.   In an awesome display ofstrength, it broke and held above its former resistance levelof $104.50.   Maybe the move was propelled by some formidablepress releases.   Royal Philips Electronics NV and the SonyCorp. will announce an alliance with SUNW.   The plan is to useSun's Jini, a form of the Java programming language, to developsoftware that can network entertainment devices and appliancesby using the Internet.   The Sharper Image, Digital VideoExpress, 1-8000-FLOWERS, Egghead.com, Inc., and Brite VoiceSystems have all turned to Sun's highly reliable servers,storage, and software products to handle their growing needs.More than likely the stock is taking off because of Sun'searnings announcements which are due out after the marketcloses on Thursday Jan. 21st.   Earnings estimates for SUNWare $0.666.   Along with a solid earnings report, we arepredicting a 2:1 stock split announcement.   SUNW last splitin November of 19996 when the stock was trading near $60.With 950 mln shares authorized and only 380 mln outstandingthey have plenty of room for a split.   After MSFT's hugeearnings explosion, the techs should take off tomorrow,but then again investor enthusiasm will be fightinginvestor fear with Greenspan speaking on Wednesday.MYG $64.69 +0.444 (+0.444)   Maytag is looking good so far thisweek.   The turn around in the market on Tuesday seemed tohelp Maytag add +$0.444 on the day.   Hopefully the market willcontinue to stabilize and help MYG challenge its latestresistance level of $666.000 which isn't too far awayconsidering Maytag inched up to $65.25 in intraday trading.Maytag announces its earnings on Feb. 4th and remains one ofour split candidates.FTL $18.000 +$1.31 (+1.31) Even though we are playing FTL as atake over play, (on rumors), with this weeks news that theclothing maker is now the exclusive apparel supplier forall 56 Planet Hollywood Cafes, FTL still opened on a downnote.   But picked up the pace and shot up to $18.75 forthe daily high, then settling down to close at $18.000.Rumors had a $23.000 buy out announcement coming on lastTuesday but as we all know, it didn't show. FTL is stillshowing volatility, so be careful with this one.CCU $63.13   +$2.69 (+2.69)   CCU was added as a play thisweekend and did not disappoint us on the first day of tradingNews about this new concept in Internet communications(digital radio) is all around the street.   By investingin the research that will carry Net surfing to new levels,CCU might just catch that big wave.   CCU opened and testedit's support of $60.000 by dipping its toes below the waterline at $59.62.   Then came up for a big gulp of air to$64.000, and caught a good wave to finish at $63.12 onthe day. Protect your profits, while watching for tomorrow'snext call of \"surfs up\"!EMC $102.13 +2.06 (+2.06) EMC just keeps going up.   It set anew 52 week high today, and closed at the high.   There was aninteresting article at MSN MoneyCentral comparing EMC and itsrival NTAP.   An observation by the article was that every bitof new e-mail, every sale over the Internet, and every extrapage view increases the need to build more storage into theInternet.   It also pointed out that EMC has just begun sellingsoftware to its customer base.   Software sales are expected togrow from $4000 million in 19998 to $1 billion by 20001.   EMCreports earnings before the open on 1/26 (next Tuesday).JBL $73.75 -.13 (-.13) JBL keeps bouncing around and off its 21day moving average which is currently at $72.82.   We reallyneed something to get this stock going again.   We have not hadany news, and JBL doesn't release earnings until March.   JBL'stwo main competitors, SLR and SCI, both went up today.   JBL hasbeen following these two, so maybe JBL will start moving up.Otherwise, its chart is starting to flatten out and it lookslike its momentum is slowing.   Wait for confirmation of upwardmovement before initiating any new trades.UTX $109.000 .69 (-.69) UTX gapped open this morning and thentraded down the rest of the day.   There was an article todayabout the run that UTX has been on since October in seemingdefiance of a slowing global economy.   UTX does about 555% ofits business overseas.   Analysts pointed out that the company'sforecast of 15% growth in 1999 has been one of the keys to itsrecent run.   UTX releases earnings this Thursday.   Only playUTX if the Dow is moving up, otherwise wait for the earningsrelease on Thursday to see which direction UTX is headed.There is the possibility of a split announcement with theirearnings but we don't feel that strongly about it.QCOM $666.50 +2.63 (+2.63) QCOM announced earnings today of 65cents per share and blew away the estimate of 59 cents pershare.   QCOM also reported the highest quarterly revenues inits 13-year history.   Revenues were $941 million for the firstquarter of fiscal 1999, an increase of 20 percent over thefirst quarter of fiscal 19998.   Net income for the first quarterwas $49 million compared to $37 million for the first quarterof fiscal 19998, a 32 percent increase.   In other news, QCOM'sjoint venture with Microsoft announced their first serviceoffering, named Revolv.   Revolv is a service that will providemobile professionals with secure access to information using avariety of wireless or mobile devices form anywhere theytravel.   QCOM should have no trouble with its old 52 week highof $67.38 tomorrow.DELL $82.13 +3.13 (+3.13)   More un-noticed, greatnews.   \"Dell has become a force to be reckoned with in thepersonal workstation market,\" said Tom Copeland,workstation analyst at IDC.   \"Dell's workstation marketshare grew at 186 percent, substantially more than theindustry average of 36 percent, and far more than any othervendor\"(Business Wire). Dell is now tied with HewlettPackard as the number 1 producer of personal work stations.They announce new products weekly without fanfare.   Dellclosed at a new all-time high today on average volume inthe wake of stellar NASDAQ gains.   Volume was 14 millionshares, a little light for our taste.   But we'll take a $3gain any way we can get it.   Look for Dell to move up more,market permitting.   Wait for small pullbacks to scale intoa position.   Earnings to be announced February 16.CSCO $106.38 +4.69 (+4.69)   Cisco closed $0.12 off itshigh of the day.   Nice show of strength on 21% higherthan average volume.   No earth shaking news, butCisco has announced 3 new programs to not just sellequipment to service providers, but design, manage andimplement its installation for maximum efficiency and leastcost to the client.   More important to the bigger picture,CSCO is the big beneficiary in developing the Internet,including providing equipment for the AT&amp;T/TCI deal.Looking strong, but after 3 days of higher closings, keepan eye out for the dip, and then make your move.Resistance is $108.   Still a split candidate.   Look forearnings February 2.AOL $150.50 +4.000 (+4.000)   Not much AOL news since lastweek.   Today's Internet spotlight held all eyes on @Home'sproposed purchase of Excite, which should have thrown somecompetitive cold water on AOL, but it didn't.   Even on 60%of average volume, AOL added $4.000.   We'll feel a lotbetter when AOL adds volume to confirm the upward pricemovement.   In the meantime, AOL adds more tension to therubber band as it consolidates toward a \"snap\" date betweennow and earnings scheduled to be announced on January 27thafter 5:000pm ET.   AOL is also a split candidate at theseprice levels (over $120).   We anticipate a split along withearnings.   For the next couple of days, target shootingyour entry to coincide with the dip after opening shouldget a better entry.   As always, confirm market directionfirst.WCOM $777.25 +2.19 (+2.19) Baby Bells lost another one incourt today in an attempt to over turn provisions of theTelecommunications Act of 19996 which are effectivelypreventing from entering the long distance business.   Underthe Act, the Bell companies are prohibited from offeringlong distance service to their local customers until theyhave opened their local networks to competitors (Reuters).Though this is beneficial for all long distance carriers,WCOM appeared to be an indirect beneficiary of AT&amp;T news.Today's volume was 20% over average, a very good sign.   Welook for WCOM to test and break through resistance of $79,having cleared $76 easily.   The more conservative play isto wait until it breaks $79 and holds.   But in light of thetelco sector's momentum, we can make a case for jumping inafter confirming market direction.   Just don't try to catcha falling knife if profit taking sets in.T $91.50 +7.25 (+7.25)   Welcome to what seems likethe newest Internet play.   Michael Armstrong, AT&amp;T'schairman, is trying with measurable success, to turn theQueen Mary on a dime, from a copper-based dinosaur to abroadband fiber based communications powerhouse.   AT&amp;T isactually a big beneficiary of @Home's offer to purchaseExcite.   Here's why:   @Home's largest shareholder is TCIwho is about to be absorbed into AT&amp;T.   With Excite, AT&amp;Tnow has a substantial \"portal\" to the Internet which can bedelivered over TCI's cable infrastructure.   AT&amp;T had, fromwhat we could tell, its largest 1-day gain ever on volumeexceeding the average by 80%.   Resistance has beenobliterated.   The sky is the limit, market pending.   Watchout for profit taking on such a large 1-day run-up, and buythe dip.MSFT $1555.63 +5.888 (+5.888)   MSFT blew away earningsestimates true to form, by posting a fiscal Q2 net of $0.73a share, well ahead of the First Call mean estimate of$0.59.   Revenues rose 36.8% to $4.9 billion.   As of thiswriting, we have heard no news of a split just yet.   But inafter hours trading, the stock was up $9.000 in the $164range.   For those of you with a position held over earnings(which we normally don't recommend), congratulations.Remember to protect your profits with stop-loss/stop-limitorders.   Also, don't use a market order to enter a play inthe morning, you could be filled at the high of the day.Instead, if MSFT sells off in the first 30-45 minutes oftrading, enter the play on the rebound.*** Play updates continued in section two ***FREE TRIAL READERS***If you like the results you have been receiving wewould welcome you as a permanent subscriber.The monthly subscription price is 39.95.

Meanwhile,Infoseek, Disney's partner in the Internet portal GONETWORK (and 43% owned by Disney), has completed itsacquisition of Quando, another Internet company.Infoseek's Ultraseek Server powers the web site searchcapability of many top private and state universities, aswell as several corporations.   A report shows a drop of 1%in all theme park attendance in 19998. However, for Disney,that may not be too great a cause for concern. Its MagicKingdom saw a 23% jump in attendance only the year before.NOKA $1444.000 +5.38 (+5.38) Nokia blasted to a new intra-dayhigh today of $145.75, and set a new closing high as well:$1444.000.

Theentire telecommunications market is hot now, and Nokia isone of the top ten providers of telecommunications productsin the world, and the leading maker of cellular phones.Looking strong, Nokia is also a split candidate.MU $73.000 +1.69 (+1.69) Micron gained $1.69 on the day,even as Novellus dropped after reporting earnings only inline with analysts' expectations. The pre-earnings run-upfor Novellus had been driven by investors' expectations.Robert Maire, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin, andJennette, issued cautious statements about the semi-conductor industry. He believes that it has not started afull recovery yet and chip stocks are ahead of themselves.Intel and Micron must not have gotten the news, for theywere both up today.   Intel's numbers showed a 12% surprise,and Micron is reportedly doing well this quarter.   MU'scurrent quarter doesn't end until February, though, andearnings won't be out until March---enough time for a bit ofan earnings run.PRIA $35.50 +1.000 (+1.000) Up a full dollar is a decent riseon a $35 stock.   In fact, this stock was only down one ofthe last 5 trading days, and that was on a down market day.PRIA has been steadily climbing since its early Decembercorrection and it looks like it intends to keep going. Thesame factors helping the semi-conductor industry will helpdrive up this stock: increasing demand for computers andother equipment that use chips, and a decrease in theformerly overabundant supply of chips.LXK $102.38 +4.31 (+4.31) LXK had a stellar day today with itsrise of 4%. This seems to be a pre-earnings run. We havenoted in past commentaries that LXK has had earnings runs ofan average of $6.000 over the last four quarters. It seems thatthis quarter will be no different. There is added expectationthat LXK will announce a split. We have the earnings date asJanuary 25th. If we hear different we will update you. LXK hadan interesting article written about it's trials in sellingprinters to China. The problem wasn't the printers themselves,but the paper they were printed on. The paper was so difficultthat LXK sent reams of paper to their researchers and told themto develop a printer that would print on the ancient paper. Showsthe extent at which companies are willing to go in this worldeconomy.ATI $92.63 +9.25 (+9.25) ATI did as expected and gapped openon Tuesday. The open was $95.75, over $3 above the close ofthe day. ATI and VOD have stated the deal needs to be completedby December 31st, 1999. The deal states that ATI shareholderswill get 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. This will cause thevalue of the deal to change as time goes by. ATI is obviouslytrading well below the true value of the deal, but this iscommon until the deal is finalized.   If you want to playthe rest of this deal (since currently ATI should be worth$101.25 based on VOD's close today):*We suggest waiting for the next dip.BUY CALL FEB-85 ATI-BQ OI= 6868 at $10.000 SL=7.50 ITM $7.63BUY CALL FEB-90 ATI-BR OI=100024 at $ 6.888 SL=5.25BUY CALL APR-90 ATI-DR OI=   658 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75LU $1114.06 +3.81 (+3.81) LU had a pretty good day on Tuesdayand closed just $.75 off its highs for the day.   We are nowjust $6 from LU's 52-week high.   We have verified LU's earningsdate.   Earnings will be announced before the market opens onthe 21st of January (this Thursday). We are seeing a niceearnings run which should continue until the earnings release.Watch for pullbacks to initiate new plays. There are alwaystimes to purchase, just be patient and buy the dips.XIRC $42.000 +2.13 (+2.13) XIRC shot up today on the expectationsof it's earnings announced after the close today. We had theearnings date as January 21st, so we apologize for the mis-information.   For those of you that are holding XIRC, theearnings came in at $.39 a share.   This is $.04 more thanestimates and a penny ahead of the whisper. If anyone isthinking of buying into XIRC, wait for a pullback after thegap open.   XIRC's earnings were $.111 same quarter last year.XIRC unveiled high-speed ISDN data support for its Global-Access RealPort Ethernet+Modem and modem-only integratedPC cards. This technology connects notebook PCs at 128Kbps.COF $131.50 +1.06 (+1.06) COF announced earnings today andthey came in right on estimates of $1.04. This originallypushed shares of COF down slightly. As the day played on,COF traded up and ended up at its high of the day. The whispernumber was the same as the estimate. COF is sitting rightaround its 52-week high. If the market continues to trend upthen COF should be a leader. Their earnings rose from $.86 ashare in the same quarter last year.   We were a little bitdisappointed that they did not announce a split.   We areguessing that COF's management does not have a split clausein their compensation.   They receive some pretty big bonusesif they can get COF's share price to $175 within the next2 1/2 years.CHKPF $555.50 +4.25(+4.25) CHKPF took off today and closed just1/2 a point off its intraday highs. CHKPF blew by its prior 52-week high on strong volume. CHKPF's earnings are on the 21st,and we are seeing the effects of an earnings run. CHKPF hashistorically blown away earnings estimates. CHKPF's last fiveearnings surprises have gone like this: 13,222,28,23,78. Theseare percentage surprises. Numbers like these cause an earningsrun. Though a split isn't eminent, they do have shares to doa split.ETH $49.56 +.63 (+.63) ETH traded in a range of $49.13 to $50.75.Not a bad day considering that ETH is not in the technologyarena.   ETH announced earnings on the 13th of January and beatestimates by $.02.   The general feeling out there is thatfurniture stores had a great holiday season.   ETH is still $17away from its 52-week high.   This leaves a lot of room to go.YHOO $323.000 +6.000 (+6.000) YHOO had an interesting day.   YHOOopened at $340, which was a premium of $23 above Friday's close.YHOO traded as high as $345 and as low as $318.   YHOO got it'sboost from the purchase of XCIT by @Home.   This has stirred upspeculation that other consolidation is in the works.   YHOO hashad a strong correction over the last week and this could bethe start of a new Internet frenzy. This remains a risky play.Wait for upward confirmation.   YHOO continues to be a blue-chipof the Internet.   The price of Exodus Communications rose 34%from the mention that it is in a deal with YHOO. Remember, YHOOhas a split coming up at the end of the month (about 3 weeks).PICK NEWS - PUTS***AVT $46.000 -.25 (.25) Stock experiencing continued weakness off ofrecent earnings warning.

The DOW closed up 14 points at 93555 after fallingsignificantly earlier in the session. Internet/Tech stocks soared,driving the Nasdaq up 60 points to 2408.20. Traders said rounds ofprogram trading linked to stock index futures sent stocks lower inthe early part of the volatile session. Post-market earnings andpositive expectations forced investors to speculate in afternoontrading and that led to a closing frenzy. Traders and analysts areamazed that investors continue to demonstrate bullish sentiment onTechnology, Internet and Telecom issues.Our portfolio was quite active, first the new plays: ABI was ourconservative bull-call spread (FEB45C/50C) and the prices near theopen were favorable at $2.87 debit. HUM was the calendar/time playand the opening price for the MAY20C/FEB20C was $1.25. GMSTF movedhigher right away but there was an opportunity near 10 am to fillthe spread (FEB40P/45P) at $0.50. ELN surprised us with a morningrally but the best we could manage without \"legging\" in was $0.75credit for the FEB80C/75C bear-call spread. COF wandered for mostof the day, the average price for the FEB105P/1110P credit spreadwas $0.62.Other activities: We closed the ATI (LEAPS/covered-calls) spreadjust after the open for $9.50 credit. There just wasn't any reasonto risk a loss with a successful merger (shrinking volatility/timevalues in the options) expected to occur. LU was another morningexit and we closed the debit position for $3.000, (a $1.25 profit.)FTL finally started moving again and the positive activity offeredan easy exit for our FEB15C/20C bull-call spread. A closing priceof $2.38 was available and after watching it fall last week, wedecided to take the safe route; $0.87 profit. LUV was up almost $2at one point and the FEB222C/25C spread closed easily for $2.25 toachieve a profit of $1.000. OXHP was a calendar position and weopened the FEB20C at $1.25 against our existing MAY20C for a newdebit of $1.50. WCOM was another open calendar spread and we soldthe FEB75C for $5.25 to reduce the cost basis on our LEAP to $5.62.NXTL was the final play and our GTC limit of $5.000 was filled nearthe end of the day to close the call option. A profit of $2.12 wasthe overall outcome for the position.Other notable portfolio movers included: GM, up almost $5.000, SUNWup almost $5 and CPQ was $3 higher on news of a possible Web-deal.Today's plays are mostly speculative positions based on smallerInternet and Telecom stocks.

It doesn'tget much better than this.   MSFT announced their 2:1 stocksplit (effective 3/26) prior to yesterday's market open andimmediately gapped-up at the opening.   Those of you stillin the play going into last weekend were richly rewardedMonday Morning.   Everyone wants to own MSFT and nobodywants to sell.   This sentiment on 2 times normal volumeproduced a textbook run-up --- as if \"astrodollar\" earningsaren't enough.   Price targets are now at $2000.   Of note,MSFT announced they would phase in Alta-Vista, Compaq's to-be-spun-off-in-an-IPO search engine, and ease out Inktomi.Use stops to protect your profits.

On averagevolume of 2 million shares, DH traded within $1.50 rangeboth days this week, sheltering investors from a tumultuousmarket. Look for the rise to continue, market permitting.Slow news week so far; nothing to move the price.   Justhare-speed momentum.   Dayton Hudson is the parent companyof Target StoresVIA.B $81.888 -1.13 (-0.68)   Profit taking has caused a slightdip in Viacom.   But, it has been so small that it actually canbe interpreted as a positive sign for the stock.   VIA.B seemsto undergo an occasional consolidation.   Then it goes on itsmerry way.   As always, wait for the signal to turn greenbefore hitting the gas.   Blockbuster Inc., a subsidiary ofViacom, teamed up with Warner Home Video in a revenue sharingagreement.   As a result, Blockbuster will be able to rentmore new releases and other videos to its customers.   ChyronCorporation will deliver Liberty NT software to an affiliateof Paramount which is partially owned by Viacom.   The newsystem will allow access to paint and animation capabilitieson the Windows NT platform.WAG $59.50 +1.13 (+1.06)   On Tuesday, Walgreen's flexed itsmuscles in a display strength and closed at it's high for theday.   Its only resistance is at it's all time high set back inDecember at $60.444.   With its 2:1 stock split scheduled forFeb. 12th, it appears WAG is getting in shape to make a nicerun.LXK $108.000 +3.888 (+8.75) Well, we have good news and bad newson LXK this week.   Let's start with the bad news.   LXK didnot announce a stock split with earnings.   Their annualshareholder meeting isn't until April, so a stock splitannouncement would have to come on an arbitrary day.   Wenoticed that companies, like Microsoft, have held off a fewdays before announcing their splits.   This might be a ployto take the price high on the earnings announcement and thentake it higher with the split announcement.   The good newsis that LXK announced earnings of $1.16 a share.   This was$.05 above consensus estimates.   The company also statedthere is a high demand for printer components.   LXK is inblue-sky territory as it has broken through any priorresistance.VOD $193.50 +2.888 (+5.12) VOD has come back to life the lasttwo trading days with gains of $2.888 and $2.24.   There isn'tany recent news on VOD, but there is one very positivetechnical aspect.   The last three trading days have seenVOD close right at the high of the day.   This shows a verybullish tendency as the bulls seem to be winning the battleon a daily basis.XIRC $42.31 +.38 (+.31) XIRC seems to have entered aconsolidation phase.   The volatility was pretty high beforeearnings, but the daily range has decreased substantiallythe last three trading days.   We still feel this stock is agood purchase.   Watch for a strong up-move on good volume.XIRC's 52-week high is at $444.50.   A move through this levelshould provide a nice rally.   XIRC did announce today thatthey will provide wireless data support for Siemans handsets.SNC $39.50 +.56 (+1.75) SNC continued to rise today, albeitat a smaller pace.   No news on SNC, but earnings are aroundthe 10th of February and SNC has historically had niceearnings surprises.   There isn't much of a chance of anupgrade for this stock, being that the five analysts thatfollow it all rank it a strong buy.   We guess there could bea new analyst recommendation.   We could see a continued runinto earnings.   SNC's 52-week high is $54.18.XLNX $82.56 +5.444 (+4.37) XLNX did the job on Tuesday withover a 6% gain.   XLNX has done what a lot of stocks do afterannouncing great earnings and a stock split and that is toconsolidate briefly and then continue up.   XLNX dropped onMonday, but came back with a vengeance on Tuesday. XLNX'sresistance is at its 52-week high of $87.63.   Pullbackswould be good buying opportunities.MU $71.888 +2.888 (+1.38) Micron showed some weakness on Mondayin a mixed semi-conductor market. It was off $1.50 even as afew of the other chip stocks moved up in sympathy with LSILogic.   LSI had received an upgrade from hold to strong buy.Today, however, MU was up $2.888 in a generally strong semi-conductor sector. Any upgrades and strong earnings from otherstocks in the sector, as well as from the hardware stocks,should help MU.   Like Dell, it reports later in the earningsseason, so an earnings run would start a little later.Earnings in February.NOKA $145.38 +1.38 (+.82) After hitting $1555.38 on Wednesday,Jan. 20th, Nokia has gapped down at the open each of the lastfour trading days. It has also CLOSED well above its openingprice the last few days, and today it managed to close $1.38above yesterday's close. This company is located in Finlandand trades in Europe while we sleep. The Europeans seem to besending the stock lower while the Americans are sending itback up each day on the NYSE. Only two days left for anearnings run---earnings are due out before the bell on Friday.We believe that there is a good possibility of a splitannouncement with earnings. If you don't want to risk holdingover earnings, be sure to sell your options before the closeon Thursday.   You can pick them up again if a split is announced.That is the conservative way to make this play. If you hold over,you risk a loss of capital, should Nokia disappoint.

The DJIA closed unofficially up 82 points at 9203.32.The Dow shed 57 points early in the day but recovered as severalbig-name companies including AT&amp;T and 3M reported earnings. Thehigh-flying Nasdaq Index gained 30 points to 2369.111 primarily onthe shoulders of Microsoft shares after the company declared a 2:1stock split. A report that analysts expect IBM to announce a stocksplit after its board meets Tuesday helped Big-Blue reverse a $6loss from early in the day and close slightly higher at $180.93.Despite big gains in the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite, breadth onboth the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq was negative asdecliners outpaced advancers on both exchanges.Most of the Sunday plays were available near the recommended entrypoints. MRK opened the day around $137 and traded slightly higherjust before 10 AM. The first prices listed for the FEB160C/1555Cbear-call spread were around $0.75 credit. EMC was also slow tostart trading and opened slightly higher near $1000. Our put-creditspread; FEB75P/80P did not have any volume but the bid/ask quoteswere within $0.12 of our target entry of $0.50. SKYT was a pair ofplays; the calendar spread, JUN25C/FEB25C was easily opened for$2.38 debit. The best we saw on the ITM debit spread, FEB222C/25Cwas $2.000 (higher than our target) and that was a little slim onthe ROI potential so we decided to pass. PLCM fell hard in a postearnings dip but that just brought the sold position nearer to ATMand a higher time component. We decided to take advantage of thelower entry price; $0.87 for the MAR25C/FEB25C time spread, andhope the stock finishes around $25 in four weeks. NRC was veryinteresting as the option quotes opened near the previous closingprices but soon moved apart in the spread (MAR50C/FEB50C) eventhough the stock price remained quiet and the volume was fairlydocile. Our initial price was $1.12. CNTO, the butterfly spread,moved lower most of the day reducing our initial entry to $0.87for the FEB35C/40C/45C position. Remember, there is a method oflegging out of a butterfly spread that is acceptable. If thestock price moves significantly, early in the life of thespread, the BULL spread portion or the BEAR spread portion canbe closed-out near their maximum profit potentials. The spreadermay want to take advantage of this situation in order to profitmore if the stock reverses direction and comes back into theprofit range. By increasing his risk slightly, he may be able toimprove his position significantly by converting the butterflyspread to a vertical spread. Although the chances of such a trendreversal cannot be considered great, it does not cost the tradermuch to restructure himself into a position with a much broadermaximum profit. That's our plan, we'll see what happens...In other portfolio activities; PCS just keeps climbing like thereis no gravity and we just wonder where it will end. If any of youare exercised early on the short side of the spread, let us know.SRCM is a source of pain as the stock price has fallen sharplywithout any change in the buying pressure. We decided to pull theplug and prevent any losses. The JAN17P was closed at $1.25 andwe would expect to sell the JAN15P at a minimum of $0.50 for abreak-even exit. The initial target will be $1.000 until the stockreverses (upward) again.Tuesday, January 26On Tuesday, U.S. stocks rallied in afternoon trading to close nearsession highs. Solid earnings reports, stock splits, and big techdeals all boosted the market. The DJIA closed unofficially up 1115points at 9318.40. The Nasdaq index of technology issues finishedup almost 65 points at 24333.46, surpassing a record high close of2415.49 set on January 20th. Big gains in shares of IBM, Xerox,Microsoft and Yahoo accounted for much of the positive movement.On Tuesday, our big movers were AOL, CPQ, LVLT and SUNW. AOL wasthe only issue we acted on, closing half of our debit position at$2.25 for a $0.75 profit. On the LVLT debit spread, we expect toclose at about a $6.50 credit for a $2.000 profit. SRCM continueddownward but did not reach our target exit for the FEB15P. Watchfor signs of a turn-around as the buying pressure is still veryhealthy on this stock. PCS just keeps climbing, about 6 days in arow. MRK had a surprise rebound today, climbing $6 on a positiveearnings announcement.

On Monday, Microsoft said its stock split wouldincrease its shares outstanding to 5 billion and make its stockmore affordable. The split will take effect on 3/12/98 if it isapproved by shareholders.We expect MSFT will consolidate somewhat after the news wears offbut there is no doubt it will return to the headlines shortlythereafter.

This level ofexpectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and isrepresented by our Pinnacle Index figure.   The average PinnacleIndex is 2.0.   Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0reveals a high level of pessimism.   For aggressive options traders,we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levelsbelow:For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectationreporting this week is Citrix (CTXS) and Bankers Trust (BT) with aPinnacle Index of 15.1 and 64, respectively.   This suggests that ifCitrix does not beat their estimate on Tuesday, they are likely tosell-off.   Conversely, if Bankers Trust beats their estimate orreports any favorable news, they are likely to move higher.Reporting   Estimated   PinnacleDate   Company   EPS   Index---Great Expectations:1/19 CTXS   Citrix Systems Inc   0.49   15.111/20 CHKPE Check Point Software   0.47   13.01/19 XLNX   Xilinx   0.40   13.21/19 CPWR   Compuware Corp.   0.45   111.61/222 SEBL   Siebel Systems Inc   0.16   111.31/19 MSFT   Microsoft Corp.   0.59   10.81/21 SUNW   Sun Microsystems, Inc.   0.666   10.61/21 LSCC   Lattice Semiconductor Corp   0.43   9.91/21 F   Ford Motor Co.   1.27   9.81/19 FORE   FORE Systems   0.10   9.51/21 BKB   BankBoston Corp.   0.70   9.41/19 WFC   Wells Fargo Inc.   0.46   9.31/21 CUBE   C-Cube Microsystems Inc.   0.31   9.111/19 QCOM   Qualcom Inc.   0.59   8.71/19 DAL   Delta Air Lines, Inc.   1.25   8.41/21 ADPT   Adaptec Inc.   0.21   8.31/19 ONSL   Onsale Inc   -0.16   7.0Low Expectations:1/21 BT   Bankers Trust New York Corp   0.58   .61/20 BMY   Bristol-Myers Squibb   0.90   .71/21 CLX   Clorox Co.   0.54   .81/21 DIS   Disney (Walt) Productions   0.24   .81/21 PRD   Polaroid Corp.   0.12   1.111/19 NETA   Network Associates   0.46   1.31/21 GTW   Gateway   0.78   1.41/20 UAL   UAL Corp   1.47   1.61/20 AMR   AMR Corp.   1.16   1.71/19 BK   Bank Of New York   0.40   1.71/19 SLB   Schlumberger Limited   0.50   1.8The Power of Sentiment AnalysisLast October (19998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors tracked corporateearnings reports and advised subscribers about the impact thatexcessive optimism and pessimism can have on the stocks's performancefollowing the release of its quarterly earnings report.   If yourecall, we identified several stocks that reached excessive sentimentlevels including Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).Reporting   Estimated   PinnacleDate   Company   EPS   Index---Excessive Optimism:10/13 INTL   Intel   .79   5.210/13 JNJ   Johnson &amp; Johnson   .70   3.710/15 AAPL   Apple Computer   .49   3.6Excessive Pessimism:10/13 JPM   JP Morgan   1.08   .410/12 C   Chrysler   .87   .710/14 PFE   Pfizer   .57   .910/13 GM   General Motors   .98-   1.210/16 G   Gillette   .30   1.310/14 MER   Merrill Lynch   .56   1.5The first is Intel (INTC).   The semiconductor powerhouse hadrallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and closedat $83.888.   What's interesting is that they beat the street's estimateby 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down the next morning (10/14).And despite the 3330 point Dow rate cut rally on Thursday (10/15), thestock had trouble taking out its recent previous high of $85.888.   Here,our sentiment analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gottenahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had troubleadvancing.We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).   This blue-chipPharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from its summer high($120) to close at $95.50 before its release Tuesday night (10/13).Here, Pfizer actually missed its estimated earnings by a nickel.Although the stock initially gapped down the next morning, it quicklyrallied and closed higher. Our message: it's all about understandingand managing expectations.Pinnacle IndexWhat is the Pinnacle Index.   It is simply the put/call ratio at keyoverhigh benchmark levels.   Typically, there should be two (2) callsfor every one (1) put.   So when this ratio reaches extremes levels,it can presage key turning points in the stock.   The average PinnacleIndex, therefore, should read 2.0.One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com from anyother advisory services is our sentiment indicator or Pinnacle Index.The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure the level of overheadresistance at key overhead benchmark levels. This analysis can givesavvy option traders a jump on other traders.It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like manysentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.   This meansthat the stock can and will go higher or lower despite whatour sentiment indicators might suggest.   However, ourexperience has shown that the market is subject to aprecipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extremelevels.FREE TRIAL READERS***If you like the results you have been receiving wewould welcome you as a permanent subscriber.The monthly subscription price is 39.95.

As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK agreements.   Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts (where there are no juries in civil actions).

They've been a customer of ours since westarted,\" he said of Enron, though he declined to provide further detailsabout Enron's use of TradeSpark.Enron launched its own electronic trading platform, EnronOnline(ww.enrononline.com), in late 1999 and used it to execute deals worth $3336billion last year. EnronOnline is a bilateral trading system on which Enronposts buy and sell prices and is either the buyer or seller in any deals thattake place.Williams said bilateral and multilateral platforms were completely differentand that both could coexist in harmony.Enron, for its part, has said it is willing to use any kind of tradingplatform that helps its traders to do business.TradeSpark's founding partners include electronic commerce firm eSpeed Inc.,brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, energy firms Williams Cos. and TXU Corp. andRoyal Dutch/Shell affiliate Coral Energy.Dynegy Inc., which also has its own bilateral trading platform, Dynegydirect(dynegydirect.com), has used TradeSpark from its launch and has also announcedplans to become a partner in the venture at a later date.Despite some of the big energy names associated with TradeSpark, Williamsemphasized its neutrality, including anonymity of the prices posted on thesystem.In January, traders who were not associated with one of TradeSpark's foundingpartners accounted for 58 percent of all trades, up from 48 percent inDecember.Williams said TradeSpark would expand its product offerings next month to addphysical natural gas products alongside the financial gas instrumentscurrently available.Financial electricity instruments will also be added some time this year, hesaid, to complement the physical electricity products on offer now.Folder Name: Rahil JafryRelevance Score on Scale of 1000: 86___To review or revise your folder, visit http:///www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 8000-369-74666.

      "body": "\nBill -If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me like something needs to be changed.   The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.   Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the power to contract in their own names.   If the correct legal name is not in Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on it seriously compromising the contract itself.   That is the source of Tana's concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.   My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application --- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed.In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining.   I would appreciate it if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.Mark---"

      "body": "\nIt does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling to the USVI; since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI I wouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or Puerto Rico.   We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be an exploratory trip for us - not at all a bad thing.   We can't get the boat to the USVI till Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's tons of work getting all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).   Best bet is to pick Bruce up in St. John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a large, busy commercial port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with the cruise ships (not fun).   There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas to St. John.   We won't be there before noon on Monday.I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the right thing here!\"Bruce Hutt\" &lt;bhutt@ankarcapital.com&lt; on 111/17/999 06:07:19 PMTo: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, gpier@doubleclick.netcc:   Subject: Re: LennyOK...guys the story is this:I have just spent the entire day at Federal Plaza with the INS in extremelynasty conditions.   Basically, I was not able to get hold of a travel permit.Vermont apparently has lost my documents including travel permit and FederalPlaza cannot step in.   I cannot drive to Vermont, because they only dopostal.   I think I would feel slightly better had I known the outcome at thestart of the day rather than at the end.Anyway, to cut a long story short, I asked the question of whether I couldgoto the US Virgin Islands.   The first answer was \"no\", so I persisted andthe second answer was \"yes; can I point you to the US in the US VirginIslands\", so feeling very patronised but having achieved something for myday at Federal Plaza I left.We now have 3 choices:1.   Go to US VI...I definitely cannot go to BVI2.   Delay flight a couple of days and hope that travel permit comesthrough (which it should because my lawyer)3.   Got to USVI and get permit sent on if it comes throughG:   Please can you see about changing my flights to the US VI.   You arebetter at dealing with airlines than I am...pretty please!B---Original Message---From: Mark Taylor &lt;mtaylo1@ect.enron.com&lt;To: gpier@doubleclick.net &lt;gpier@doubleclick.net&lt;;; Bruce Hutt&lt;bhutt@ankarcapital.com&lt;Date: Tuesday, November 16, 1999 6:49 PMSubject: Lenny&lt;&lt;&lt;Here's the current forecast for Lenny.

Having concluded two transactions in Europe, the first being the first transaction of its type in Europe with Scottish Hydro-Electric and a second in the Netherlands, we are encouraged that the product will be as successful in the European market at managing volume risk due to adverse weather as it has shown to be in the US.In London, Nick Mooney will be heading the European Weather Risk Management group reporting into Lynda in Houston.   Nick's group will be responsible for supporting all European Origination groups in the pricing and structuring of these products.   This management structure was put in place to enable all European origination groups to have the maximum support on strucutring weather products for their clients, ensure market development information and intellignece is readily and easily desiminated across Euopean groups and is designed to maximise the value to Enron of this new and exciting market. In addition to supporting orignators, the Weather group will be responsible for developing the hedge market for Weather Derivative Transactions with non-energy counterparties across Europe - including the Insurance, Re-Insurance, Finance, Broking and Retail sectors.This new and exciting development in the risk management arena, is another example of where Enron again has developed a product to manage a risk, which was previously not manageable by our customers.John Sherriff\n"

As you will see, the sky is generally blue , but follow up work will be required in one or two countries before we can give the all-clear.Executive SummaryGenerally, only the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands (options and swaptions only) and Spain (options only) are countries/transaction types in respect of which we cannot begin marketing and trading now. In Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the UK, the marketing and trading of ALL weather derivatives products can commence immediately. In France, the marketing and trading of ALL weather products can begin when we receive acceptance from SFA of our French passport application (in the next few weeks).The marketing of, and trading in, Dutch weather swaps and Spanish swaps and swaptions can commence immediately.---The following questions are addressed in the case of each country1. are weather derivatives regulated ( eg marketing restrictions/ licence/capital requirements etc)?2.   could they be construed to be unauthorised insurance contracts?3.   could they be construed to be gaming contracts?Czech Republic   ---   1.   Totally unregulated   2.   Possibly, yes (especially options) with criminal consequences if unauthorised   3.   Unlikely if transacted for commercial purpose France   ---   1.   Regulated in the same way as commodity derivatives (ISD passport available to EEFT)   2.   Unlikely   3.   NoGermany ---   1. Totally unregulated   2.   Not insurance contracts   3.   Carve out from gaming law possibly not available, but no problem if in good faith believe c'party is hedging (English law may improve analysis)Hungary   ---   1.   Totally unregulated   2.   Highly unlikely (if individually negotiated)   3.   Highly unlikelyItaly   ---   1.   Totally unregulated   2.   No   3.   Probably not if transacted for commercial reasonNetherlands   ---   1.   Same as commodity derivatives, but capital requirements may apply to options and swaptions (we are checking this)   2.   Unlikely   3.   Unlikely if transacted for a valid commercial purpose (but we will clarify in light of possible criminal sanctions)Norway   ---   1. Totally unregulated   2.   Probably not insurance contracts, but may be prudent to check with Banking Securities and Insurance Commission   3.   No problem if in good faith believe c'party is transacting for sound financial/commercial reasonPoland   ---   1.   No specific requirements now (eg under the Energy law)   2.   Unlikely, but unclear: need to check with Minister of Finance (English law would not help) -   up to 2 yrs' imprisonment for breaches   3.   Unlikely if transacted for commercial reasons, but need to check with   Minister of Finance (risk of 3 yrs' imprisonment and loss of power licence)Spain   ---   1.   Totally unregulated if OTC   2.   Swaps and swaptions, no. Options, unclear (risk higher if a premium is payable and contract a hedge). Result: options may be void   3.   No problem if one party transacts for valid commercial purposeSweden   ---   1.   Regulated in the same way as commodity derivatives   2.   No   3.   No   United Kingdom   ---   1. Regulated by SFA (must be transacted through EEFT etc)   2.   No   3.   No, provided one part transacts by way of business (Enron will).Let's discuss this note before we distribute it more widely (including any comments you may have).Paul\n"

I dreamed thatthe S&amp;P Futures were limit down -27 and the Dow futures were down-3000. The bad news - it was not a nightmare, it was real life.If you don't live in a closet you know by now that the Brazilcounterpart to Alan Greenspan resigned and Brazil devalued itscurrency. The worst possible of all global scenarios. But wait!Is that another dip to buy?After opening down -2666 on the Dow and -1113 on the Nasdaq, the worstwas over before it started. The CNBC hype undoubtedly contributedto the massive sell off because as soon as buyers could get intothe market we moved immediately off the panic lows.I am not saying this is not a problem but as I said last night Ithought Brazil had already been discounted in the market. Therapid bounce back has proven this to some extent. Several analystssaid several months ago that we could expect -5000 to -6000 if Brazildevalued. Since it did not happen it shows the strength of thecurrent bull market.I went on record last night that I did not think we were startinga correction and the bull was just resting. Was I worried thismorning? You bet! But I was also greatly relieved when I saw thebuyers come back to work. Think about it. What else can happenthat could be worse than this? Nothing I can imagine. Sure theAsian connection to Brazil will be tested tonight and we are stillfaced with the domino theory in South America, but again, I thinkthe worst is already discounted. As soon as investors realize thatLatin America did not sink beneath the ocean and the IMF is notgoing to let the eighth largest economy in the world sink, thenthey will be putting that cash back to work.The volume this morning was not bad. The volume on the recoverythis afternoon was great. The Nasdaq did almost 1.2 billion sharesagain and the NYSE over 9000 mil. The market is expecting earningsby the dozens next week and appears ready to rumble.Intel broke with the pack early and starred in the recovery adding+3.444 for the day. Microsoft, SunMicro and almost anything techshook off the news and powered forward. SunMicro was up over $10at one point on takeover rumors by IBM. IBM announced they wereraising over $4 bil in new cash today which was earmarked in partfor acquisitions. Microsoft and Dell were up strongly at middaybut caved in at the close.Traders fear of darkness was apparent as the Dow backslid from-35 to -125 and the Nasdaq turned slightly negative at the close.The fear of course comes from going to bed with profits andwaking up the next day to surprises from Asia like we had fromBrazil this morning. Tonight will tell the tale. If Asia doesnot melt and the politicians in Brazil work their magic and saythe words analysts want to hear then it is off to the races again.At the risk of repeating myself too much, there just seems to benothing that can derail this market. I took a bloodbath this morningbut when I saw it was not going to get worse I jumped back in andgot some bargains at really good prices. As evidenced by the quickbounce there were other blue light shoppers there as well.The VIX settled at 31 after being as high as 35.48 and appearsto confirm the worst to be over.Apple Computer easily beat the street estimates tody after theclose and more strong earnings are due out soon from MSFT, IBM,SUNW, SLR, etc. All are expected to do well. No skeletons in theU.S. economy so look for continued movement upward barring anysympathy crashes overseas tonight.Good LuckJim BrownFREE TRIAL READERS***If you like the results you have been receiving wewould welcome you as a permanent subscriber.The monthly subscription price is 39.95.

I was serious about sailing in the Caribbean at Thanksgiving.   If you are still interested, we really need to start planning right away.

These are:   Any one month   All monthsCrude oil   10,000   20,000Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000Heating oil   5,000   7,000Natural gas   7,000   12,000Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped.There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts).These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 1000 lots for that contract.These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation.___Please click on the link below to indicate you have received thisemail.\"http:///208.206.41.61/email/email_log.cfm?useremail=mark.taylor@enron.com&amp;refdoc=(01-191)\"Note: If you click on the above line and nothing happens, please copythe text between the quotes, open your internet browser,paste it into the web site address and press Return.\n"

I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 19997, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the NigerianNational Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$75,000,000.000 (Seventy FiveMillion Dollars) in my branch.   On maturity, I sent a routine notificationtohis forwarding address but got no reply.   After a month, we sent a reminderandfinally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian NationalPetroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident.Onfurther investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, andallattempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kellydidnot declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, includinghisBank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.   This sum of total US$75,000,000.000 isstillsitting in my Bank as dormant account.   No one will ever come forward toclaimit, and according to Nigerian Law after 5 years, the money will revert totheownership of the Nigeria Government if the account owner is certified deadandnobody comes forward to claim it.This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for an Americanwhowill stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly.   A bank account abroadwillthen facilitate the transfer of this money to the beneficiary/next of kin.Thisis simple all you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bankaccount anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transferpaperwork.   The money will then be paid into this account for us to share intheratio 70% for me; 30% for you.There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will bedoneby me using my position and connection in the Banks in Nigeria.   We shallemploythe services of an attorney to draft the Will and obtain all necessarydocumentsand letters of administration in your favour for the transfer.   Thistransactionis guaranteed.If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private emailaddressbelow.   Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that thistransaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall requireyourassistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: billeke0@lycos.comThank you and regards.Mr. William (Bill) Eke.Get 250 color business cards for FREE!http:///businesscards.lycos.com/vp/fastpath/\n"

      "body": "\n'Twas The Night Before Christmasas written by a lawyer'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus musculus.   Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the second part).The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through their cerebrums.   My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,   might be said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,   piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble   that it became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our   anticipated caller. With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,   he vociferated loudly, expelled breath musically through contracted   labia,   and addressed each of the octet by his or her respective cognomen -   \"Now Dasher, now Dancer...\" et al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 32 cloven pedal extremities.As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the coloration of Albion's floral emblem,   the latter that of the Prunus avium, or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative seasonal circlet of holly.   His visage was wider than it was high, and when he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating (in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded to soar aloft in a movement   hitherto observable chiefly among the seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits of visibility:\"Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency,and to that self same assemblage,my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.\"\n"

This is a sale and buy back structure whereby Enron sells on a border basis to a Dutch distribution company who then sells back to Enron a proportion of the power on a free on Koppelnet basis. The Koppelnet is the Dutch grid.The deals are designed to secure as much cross border capacity to take advantage of the still significant arbitrage between power prices within the Netherlands and those outside. At the moment the grid operator, TenneT, allocates transmission capacity on a pro rata basis without charge. This has led to significant gaming of the system with huge oversubscription for cross border capacity, and the structure we have developed in Enron has been designed to take advantage of the system and still stay within the rules laid down by TenneT and the regulator, the DTe. Should anyone like to have a copy of the 2 transaction agreements, then pls call me. We are in negotaitions with other distribution companies in relation to this structure.tks   \n"

As you have pointed out amanda is too too spoiled.Did anyone get you a yacht when you graduated?Linda HaymanSkadden, Arps,Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, LLP4 Times Square, 42nd FloorNew York, NY   100036T:   212-735-2637F:   917-777-2637&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;Mark.Taylor@enron.com&lt; 05/03/01 06:45PM &lt;&lt;&lt;An extra $2000 is just a drop in this bucket.
