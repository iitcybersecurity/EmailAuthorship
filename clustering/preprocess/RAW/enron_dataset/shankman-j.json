Position P/L will have to be reported within Global Products but we will pull it out as a separate line item at the bottom of the report. Positions at this time are not an issue but should it   become a concern between now and approval of a new book we will need to address it as we are the VAR with discretionary limits.   \n"

EDFT, seemingly still unsure of it's burn schedule one week to the next had a spot cape to find a home for if he could replace with tonnage from either ourselves or the mkt for December delivery. We offered equivalent of $39 cif ARA but they chose to take her themselves and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability to extract from the mkt anything better than $40.50-$41 cif for deliveryDecember period. Indeed, due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which weshowed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at $40.75 on a cif basis. Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continuesto reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts - there is no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices. Many were already well sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill oldEuropean contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets. Certain South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year andDrummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on track stating that it won't be until May next year that they are fully back on track again. While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets. Q1 01 still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied. Stillcould see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q1 01 at $41.50 fob and Jan/Dec 01 at $41.25 - watch this space.SPOT TRADES   While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various channels it has been a week without any spot business. As perabove the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirementsrather than pay these high prices in advance. We are also not too aggressive at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arrivinglater in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome returns as we move further into the winter months and those spotbuyers are eventually forced to the table.SELLING SIDEMission still have not covered their December requirements. Our offer of 1.46 GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and 1.28 GBP FOR Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of 1.30 delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material. We said thathe shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell that wud be very kind. The sage continues!We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke Bremen for between 850mmt - 1mil tonnes per yearstarting Jan 01. Prices will be linked to the BAW Index.HEW/VW combined are tendering for 270,000mt for Q2 shipment into Hamburg. We have offered $42.50 cif.Electrabel looking for 50mmt each month 20001. EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q1 01.Veag - 3000mmt cif Rostock for Nov000/Jun 01Endesa - 4 capes for 20001.H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working various possibilities of swapping material for 20001.While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian coal going forward they are looking for us to sell themsome sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward!Fenosa - 250mmt of Low Vol U.S material for 20001 but so far unable to get an offer basis this material.Innogy looking for upto 1mil tonnes for delivery throughout 20001Bewag still have tender out for 5000mmt for next year where we are looking to put a proposal to them basis Polish material.BUYING SIDEContinue to work Emerald for material out of the U.S. - hopefully persistence will pay and we may close something this week for 20001 shipments.Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q1 shipment FOB Santa Marta at $32 basis 1118000btu/lbEnsham had a lower quality coal (cape quantity) on offer at $25.30 fob Oz but unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospectto find a home for.Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q1 which would equate to somewhere in the region $41 cif ara. Would be goodto test viability of shipping thru this port.In tandem with 5 year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a five year Agency Agreement with German counterpartywhereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen obligations.NCSC - looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African material for 20001.EOLWhat started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week yet. Between Thursday and Friday we did 16 trades viaEOL equating to just over 3000,000mt. Glencore was the main sponsor of the action on Friday, intent on driving prices higher they werea net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitmentswith no coal assets as a backstop! Life to date we have traded 950,000mt on EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the 1mil mark this week. We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at Coaltrans in two weeks time.GAMEPLANRunning the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing tonnage to play with for next year. To date our Drummond long hasbeen the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply out of Puerto Drummond for the first 6 months of next year. With thedemand that we have on the table today we could turn our 1 mill long into a short with no problem at all.   While there will always be a levelwhere one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so at the traded levels for 01 today despite the absolute levels being the upper end of the historic range. We still have a little way to go to actually signing contracts which secures us the 5 year deal with stadtwerke Bremen but   on the assumption we do we must start looking at our supply strategy for the first 6 months of next year whereit looks to be most challenging. The business we will be fantastic for creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that wecan supply 10% of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace.Best RegardsJez\n"

What remains now is cif mkt   which is in backwardisation for Q4 and Q1 01 versus the rest of 20001 but where stocks in Rotterdam are at near record highs at around   2.5 million mt for the end of September. Indeed, utilities and traders alike have taken advantage of the weak spot mkt we experienced   during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and play the cash / carry game. This has certainly paid   dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted   production/shipments from various geographies. While the whole curve has shifted north as a result of early buying interest for 20001   the backwardisation in the frt curves coupled with above has seen Q4 and Q1 prices increase by some $4 over past 6 weeks to   absolute values at $39 cif ARA - this represents a prm of between $0.75-$1.000 over Jan/Dec 01 run. Believe the front end will continue   to remain tight due to supply squeeze we are feeling and high frt rates but going forward into next year we may see some price pressure   from levels we are today as a consequence of lower frt rates, increase in prod'n, synfuel into Europe and weaker continental power prices   from the high levels they are today. Control of FOB origin prices through continued consolidation in the production side of the industry   could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible.

Likely to be a cape quantity for Q2 delivery.AES - UK coal for Q4 and Q1 20001.BHP - 1 June 20001 Cape.EOLWe are just shy of reaching 5000,000mt mark for total volume of tonnage traded via EOL with the activity that went on this week. There continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we really need to focus on converting the increasing numberof guest user ID's we are giving out into actual transactions on the system - many are still afraid of the technology, many are still ignorantof how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply   don't have the authority - hence we continue to focuson preaching the word to all and sundry!!! Highlight this week was having Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were propping the mkt up on the buy side. We are moving ahead with posting options on the SECA contract on EOL.GAMEPLANCurrent mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for 20001 and with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for 20001from the high levels today ($9.50 RBCT - ARA Cape) combined with a somewhat weaker tone in continental power prices for 01 we are fairly keen to hit some of this business at current price levels. We have benefited from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half 01 shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind. Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage fromother geographies such as South Africa, Australia, U.S and Russia that will allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book.Have extended dlist this week - if you donot wish to receive then please let me know and likewise if you would like peopleadded.Best RegardsJez \n"

While there had been some nervousshort covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had   fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined andin general have refused to commit to these numbers. The lack of business at these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and ofcourse mkt psychology with it. While producers are still playing lip service to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which reflect levels of $31 FOB Richards Bay and wud trade down to $30.50. Several sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days thatnegotiations between Kepco and South African producers for price fixing 20001 tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will bean additional 3 million mt which the South Africans have to find a home for - destination Europe most likely. On the flip side Kepco willbe looking towards Indonesia and China to substitute this tonnage and this combined with rumours that Formosa Plastic will be lookingfor some 3 million tonnes of additional material from China cud serve to tighten the Pacific mkt over the next months for first half 20001.There is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over last three weeks with business being booked out of the U.S, Indonesia and Australia at numbers close to what was achievable fromS.A. into Europe. This can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this mktplace and indeed German utilities who have been held to ransom by similar minded producers in Poland are now exploring every end to do business with other suppliers - namely ourselves in order to avoid being captive to one supplier. Weglekoks incidentally are currently in the mkt buying Russian material to cover sales made against Polish to Bewag - we don't want to be short Polish in the near term!Mkt now trading at $41.25 Fob barge ARA for Jan/Dec 20001and $42.15 level for the Jan/Mar 20001. We still see couple dollars on thedownside although the latest incident (guerrilla attack on rail line last week) has Gary Drummond threatening to cut production downin Colombia by half for first few months of 20001 to make a point to the unions. We are still trying to ascertain how much this wud bull the mkt short-term but we wud certainly take the opportunity to sell any spike.SPOT TRADES   January pnmx FOB Santa Marta from Masefield at $333pmt basis 1118000btu One Cape of Colombian to Scotts Power for March delivery to Hunterston at $41 basis 6000kcal/kgSld the Prima Cape   Option which was bot a fortnight ago at $30.65 to NCSC for $333.25 FOB Tanjang Bara both basis 64000 kcal/kg.Bot 25mmt Russian material CIF Stettin at $39.75 to put against our Bewag commitmentsSld 5mmt Colombian to BEC (Duisbourg) basis $42.5 FOB ARA Sld API 2 Index for 20001 for 15mmt a month to Innogy Sld API 2 Index for 20002 for 15mmt a month to InnogySELLING SIDEOne Cape Q1 of Generic South African to Anglo at $32.5 FOB RBCT basis 6000kcal/kg5000mmt delivered Berlin for Bewag for 20001.

As the figures suggest there is increasing activity/liquidity in the market with the arrival of several new players in recent weeks - most notably AEP. Increased volume in EOL has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of SECA's traded in the OTC market with more and   more utilitieswho have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party - RWE has been the latest SECA virgin to lose it's cherry closinga deal with ourselves early last week on Q1 through TFS. We are now offering our products in Euros aswell the good old green backmuch to the confusion of one or two of our clients! At current pace we shud have surpassed all our expectations by passing the 5 millmark by the end of the year.GAMEPLAN We are currently long to the tune of 1.5 mil mt but this is essentially all through optionality at origin which runs through to 20004.Strip these out and effectively we are running a short ARA position of some 1.5 mill mt   weighted pretty evenly across Q2, Q3 and Q420001 backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage out of both Richards Bay and Drummond. We are very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to go after the term Cal 01 business while running a Europeanshort pos'n which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both the frt mkts and in the Atlantic coal mkt. Shud the the European mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the money options which we wud utilise to execute anyphysical shorts in ARA and to keep mkt capped.

However the fact remains that fundamentals have changed little in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 20001. Indeed with the ocean frt market still steeply inverted for the winter versusthe rest of the year ( $111 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coasttrading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 20001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $444 with Jan/Dec20001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the origin markets are structured in a steep contango forthe remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anythingdemand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down and the financial markets under pressure and forecastsfor European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked sell off for second half of the year is unlikely wesee the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higherof absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $333 Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is stillplenty of business to be done for 20001 and my feeling is that consumers will end up buying into it rather than risk the wait andsee game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that the cartel hold and even if this is exaggeratedit's implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.SPOT TRADES 150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo basis 6000 kcal/kg160,000mt of Prima   quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo basis 64000 kcal/kg150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at $30.65 Fob Indo basis 64000 kcal/kg.2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively.

Premium - $0.50 cents.SELLING SIDEBritish Energy - pitching a 1,3 and 5 year deal to them as an extension to current contract we have with them which runs outend March.Scotts Power - looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to   FOR deal and sell incremental cape for March arrival.H Del C - offering them a 9 year put option basis the SECA.Endessa - we have offered them 4 plus 1 cape business   for 20001 based on $31 Fob South Africa.NCSC - looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising EOL in the next week to hedge some of their implied short position.Heidelberger - offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for November delivery at $47.50.Bremen - shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen supplying them some 850,000mt of genericquality coal on an annual basis.Bewag - currently working an offer to supply 1 million mt for 20001 on delivered stockpile basisENBW/Neckarverke/Preag - offering Oz material for Nov/Dec just shy of $43 fob ARA.Braunschweig - offered them 3 x 60,000mt for Mar/Jun/Jly delivery into Nordenham at $43.75 cif. Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for April/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge.BUYING SIDEDuiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us buying a cape a quarter for 20001 - they are due to getback to us within the next few days.Drummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 20002 at $35 Fob Colombia - thanks!!!Krutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russianmkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag businessgoing forward.Anker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for 20001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fobMaputo level.Masefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa Marta for 20001.Coal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out of Durban for 20001Currently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for 20001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.000 apart.We currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in Amsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backendof the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell intothe mkt.EOLMuch of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA delivery point. Details of operational functionalityare scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they themselves do not know but general consensus reckonsit will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as competition, if successful it could provide us with more accessto markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games to be had with the various producers.   Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,7000,000mt. We have seen a lot of interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros andafter that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.GAMEPLANWe had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of SouthAfrican material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mktin either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any downside potential with a host of put options which the utilitiesare keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far bettershape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning asmuch flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.Best RegardsJez\n"

We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.   I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).   We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.   We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.   Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.   In addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

This source believes that such talk is overblown, at least=\r=20\rfor now.\r RJ\r ARGENTINA:THE UNPALATABLE CHOICE AMONG DEFLATING, DEFAULTING OR DEVALUING\r Executive Summary\rThe recession in Argentina is deepening and the government faces painful=20\rchoices in addressing it\rWhile the current strategy of deflation is unpopular, default or devaluatio=\rn=20\rcould be even more painful\rDeflation will remain the strategy of choice so long as De la Rua survives;=\r=20\rif his government falls, both default\r   and devaluation become likely\rMexico and Brazil are in a stronger position to face the fallout from a=20\rdevaluation than they were in 19998\r November 16, 2000\r 1. Argentina Recession\r The question haunting observers of Argentina is whether the De la R?a=20\radministration will succeed\rin stabilizing the country=01,s economy and pulling it out of its second=20\rrecession in five years. Indeed,\rthe 111-month old administration has not lived up to expectations and is=20\rquickly losing market\rconfidence. Although the country has so far maintained the support of the I=\rMF=20\rand Washington,\rthe outcome of the unfolding crisis is by no means certain. Argentina is=20\rtrapped in a fixed\rexchange regime that succeeded in taming inflation but is now impairing its=\r=20\rcompetitiveness and\rlong-term prospects.\r 2. Deflate, Default, or Devalue?\r The administration faces a number of unenviable choices as it tries to redu=\rce=20\rthe difference\rbetween internal and external prices. It can continue with its present cour=\rse=20\rof action, attempting\rto cut its fiscal deficit amid a deepening recession and a growing debt=20\rcrisis. The adjustment of\rrelative prices would thus be accomplished through continued deflation. A=\r=20\rvariant of this scenario\rwould be to renegotiate part of its external debt, in order to reduce the=\r=20\rincreasingly onerous interest\rpayments, or default on its sovereign bonds. This, however, would destroy t=\rhe=20\rlast shred of\rconfidence, jeopardize Argentina=01,s future access to international capita=\rl=20\rmarkets, and ruin the\rcountry=01,s relations with major industrialized countries. Finally, the co=\runtry=20\rcould opt to devalue.\rArguably, the financial and social cost of this action would be high, but t=\rhe=20\rcountry could recover\rrelatively quickly, as the cases of Mexico and Brazil suggest.\r 3. Recession Threatens De la Rua Survival\r The outcome will depend on whether the De la R?a administration remains in=\r=20\rpower. The\rgovernment is committed to pursuing a deflationary adjustment, hoping that =\rit=20\rwill pay off by next\ryear, provided that the US dollar weakens and that its access to=20\rinternational markets is\rmaintained. However, if the deflation is more prolonged and the economic=20\rrecession becomes\rsocially and politically untenable, the ruling coalition could disintegrate=\r=20\rand the president could be\rforced to resign. In that case, the new government would probably decide to=\r=20\rdevalue immediately\rafter taking power.\r 4. Brazil and Mexico Less Vulnerable to Contagion than in 19998\r The Argentine crisis has raised the specter of emerging market financial=20\rinstability, notably in\rBrazil and Mexico. However, these fears may be unfounded given the progress=\r=20\rmade by the latter\rcountries in improving their fundamentals. Indeed, both Brazil and Mexico n=\row=20\rfeature a floating\rexchange rate regime and have gone a long way in terms of balancing their=\r=20\rfiscal accounts. Thus,\rin the event of an escalation of Argentina=01,s difficulties, both countrie=\rs are=20\rwell equipped to\rovercome temporary financial turmoil.\r\n"

In the past week, APP has co=\rme=20\rclose to default through complex trigger clauses in a mass of junk bond=20\rissues. Prospects of an APP default have already sent tremors through the=\r=20\rAsian bond market and could have larger implications for emerging market=20\rdebt. This week, the Indonesian government further complicated the picture =\rby=20\rattaching assets of the Sinar Mas group, including APP, to guarantees of=20\rSinar Mas group=01,s $1.5 billion debt to Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII=\r),=20\rIndonesia=01,s fifth largest bank and formerly part of a Sinar Mas group.   =\rThe=20\rWijaya family is likely to postpone payments until the last possible minute=\r,=20\rbefore seeking a workout and corporate restructuring.\r RJ\r The Immediate Problem\r o $1.6 billion in bonds are due in 20001, on top of $1.5 billion owed to the=\r=20\rIndonesian government through the Sinar Mas group\ro Between now and April 30, the APP group must come up with $145 million fo=\rr=20\rnine separate coupon payments coming due. APP itself will owe $87 million i=\rn=20\rinterest payments on four bonds over the next month\ro APP missed a February 1 deadline for two bond payments of $43 million; on=\re=20\rpayment has been made but the other, of $13.5 million, is still hanging\r Risks are formidable, with management playing a cat and mouse game with bon=\rd=20\rholders in order to maximize their negotiating position in a restructuring:\r o Assets are encumbered by complex cross-guarantees that make it difficult =\rto=20\rimpossible to separate out individual properties\ro The New York Stock Exchange has threatened a de-listing unless APP stock=\r=20\rrises above the US$1 level; de-listing will trigger immediate redemption=20\rclauses in some classes of bonds\ro The company=01,s Indonesian assets are diseased. Despite APP=01,s apparen=\rtly=20\rsound business model, it is being corrupted by crime that is systemic withi=\rn=20\rthe Indonesian forestry and forest products industry\ro Inventory dumping by APP, particularly in China, has been a major factor=\r=20\rdepressing paper prices since mid-2000\ro APP=01,s management has failed to offer transparent explanations for thei=\rr=20\rcash shortages. It has not reported third quarter earnings for 2000, due la=\rst=20\rNovember, to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (although, as a=20\rforeign company it has six months to report earnings, versus one month for =\rUS=20\rcompanies). Inter-company transfers may be masking serious problems within=\r=20\rthe APP group.=20\ro Indonesian political instability is worsening with the threatened=20\rimpeachment of Indonesia=01,s President Wahid, lowering prospects for a=20\rgovernment bailout of APP=01,s parent company, the Sinar Mas group, and its=\r=20\rowners, the Wijaya family.\ro There are clear prospects for collateral damage to Asian capital markets,=\r=20\rwith S&amp;P already cutting ratings and a consequent shrinkage of liquidity.=\r=20\r APP Risk Profile:\r APP=01,s only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset =\rsales=20\ror a sell-off of pulp and paper inventory. Neither has much chance of=20\rsuccess. APP=01,s current strategy is to muscle its bond-holders into a=20\rrestructuring agreement as soon as possible, most likely before an early=20\rMarch deadline for its next coupon payment falls due. There are significant=\r=20\robstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring, from cross-guarantees=\r=20\rof bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various=20\rjurisdictions, to inter-company transfers that present a false picture of=\r=20\rfinancial health in some of its operating companies. Such obstacles ensure=\r=20\rthat a restructuring exercise will be lengthy. APP is the fifth largest=20\rissuer of junk bonds in the world, and has been regarded as a benchmark bon=\rd=20\rfor Indonesia. Until the last few months, it was the only bond in the world=\r=20\rthat traded at a premium to its own government=01,s bonds, and was the only=\r=20\rIndonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the=\r=20\rdepth of the Asian crisis. A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian=20\rbonds in the event of a default, as investors wait to see what happens to=\r=20\runsecured creditors who account for 40 percent to 50 percent of APP=01,s US=\r$12=20\rbillion in debt. At the moment, systemic fallout seems likely to be limited=\r=20\rto the Asian region, as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri=\rng=20\rthe Asian financial crisis.=20\r APP Key Decision Makers:\r The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda=20\rWijaya. No others in the company are privy to all the Group=01,s Affairs, o=\rr to=20\rcorporate strategy. Information is extremely closely held. Sources say that=\r=20\rthe APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive=\r=20\runderstanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o=\rf=20\rthe assets of APP or its subsidiaries, so complex are the cross guarantees=\r=20\rand trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years.\r Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game, engaging i=\rn=20\rbrinkmanship with their bond holders. It signaled the market that it could=\r=20\rmove into a default situation on February 1 when its paper making subsidiar=\ry,=20\rPabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah, failed to make payments on two different bond=\r=20\rissues worth $43 million. On February 6, APP finally paid the coupon on one=\r=20\rof the bonds, a US$6000 million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius=\r,=20\rjust within a grace period of five business days. If Tjiwi Kimia had failed=\r=20\rto meet the deadline, it would have triggered cross default clauses on a=20\rseries of other bonds. The second coupon payment, of $13.5 million, for a=\r=20\rUS$2000 million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in 20001, is now late. W=\re=20\rexpect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment. The=\r=20\rgroup is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring. The=\r=20\rbetter its cash position is, the more APP will be able to operate from a=20\rposition of strength in a restructuring negotiation.=20\r According to one source: APP is =01&amp;signaling the market and its bond holde=\rrs=20\rthat it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before=20\reverything collapse. The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now, while they=\r=20\rstill have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin=\rg=20\rleft.=018 APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another=\r=20\rbecause the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies, some =\rof=20\rwhich have significant cash flow, is different from those in the parent. Th=\ris=20\ris obviously a dangerous game, but one in which APP feels it has no choice=\r=20\rbut to engage. The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be, and=\r=20\rthe greater its chances of survival in some form. Trying to keep control of=\r=20\rthe situation so that it doesn=01,t unravel is the name of the game at this=\r=20\rpoint. Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their=\r=20\rnon-core subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring. They have been=\r=20\ractively shopping their China assets for several months, and sources indica=\rte=20\rthat their packaging assets will also go on the block. APP is still hopeful=\r,=20\rhowever, of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms.\r One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is=\r=20\rthat much of the sales from both companies come from within the group, and=\r=20\roften these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas. Another source said,=\r=20\r=01&amp;This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if=\r you=20\rstart messing with the structure, let=01,s say one group of bond holders wa=\rnts=20\rto wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer, you could=20\rthreaten the whole group.=018=20\r The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors, and are not in the=20\rcategory of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan, who was=20\rsentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and=\r=20\rcorruption. They are not saints =01) the Indonesian government removed the=\r=20\rWijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was=20\rnationalized in 1999, based on evidence that they exceeded the 30 percent c=\rap=20\rfor lending to affiliates. However, they depend heavily on international=20\rcapital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would=\r=20\rbar future access. At the moment, they have few alternatives to raise cash =\rto=20\rmeet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales. The=\r=20\rcompany has built up substantial paper inventory, and according to one=20\rsource, it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it=\r=20\rcould find a buyer. This is a big if, however, since current prices are=20\rdepressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make=20\rmatters worse.\r Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments:\r An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th=\rat=20\rAPP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets.   These assets include:\r o PT Ekamas Fortuna\ro PT Purinusa Ekapersada\ro Ningbo Zhonghua Paper\ro Gold Hongye Paper\ro Gold Hai Paper (Kunshan) Co.\ro Jin Yu (Qingyuan) Tissue Paper Industry\r The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the=\r=20\rassets on offer, but had held back because of the impenetrable cross=20\rguarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an=\r=20\racquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity. The=\r=20\rexecutive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in=\r=20\rthe context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would=20\rfinance an acquisition. Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin=\ra=20\rfactories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intra-company prices.=\r=20\rOnce the company is broken up into pieces, it will have to rely on the worl=\rd=20\rmarket and will no longer be able to produce at a profit. =20\r Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected. It =\ris=20\rsaid to remain interested although the price it is willing to pay will be=\r=20\rconsiderably less. One of the problems with APP=01,s brinkmanship strategy =\ris=20\rthat it is lowering the value of its assets. Companies will not be willing =\rto=20\rpay book value when it comes time for the company to sell off its non-core=\r=20\rassets.=20\r Restructuring is imminent, creating opportunities for investors:\r o A restructuring of the company in the near term seems inevitable and will=\r=20\rproduce returns for existing bond holders if they bought at low enough pric=\res=20\rand if their debt is secured by APP assets outside Indonesia\ro A restructuring will release some of APP=01,s assets, which are considere=\rd=20\rattractive except for those in Indonesia. APP is the world=01,s low cost=20\rproducer of pulp and paper, with substantial assets in Indonesia, China, an=\rd=20\rIndia. Its Chinese factories are attractive despite current over-capacity i=\rn=20\rthe domestic Chinese market.

The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil stock situation is at least stabilizing, even if stocks have not built substantially, and that, thus far, despite a few weeks of colder-than-normal temperatures, heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key US market. That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving speculative interest into the market. Furthermore, the potential for weakness in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 20001. The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide, yet, the Iraqi export cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals. If the cutoff lasts through December, the effect will be pronounced-it would turn a projected fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) into a stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions, and exports may again cease. At some point such a development would have a price supportive effect. CERA's price outlook for 20001 remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch released in late November. Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production, the projected average for first quarter 20001 is $29 per barrel for WTI. However, this outlook is based on OPEC's announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its production by the start of the second quarter. A failure to restrain output would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $27 WTI for the first quarter of 20001, with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in the first. The downward pressure results from the prospect of a larger-than-usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 3.0 mbd-with a cut in OPEC output.Iraq in a Twilight Zone As anticipated, Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UN-controlled \"oil for food\" program as of December 1 in protest over the rejection by the Security Council's sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule.*Iraq's pricing was judged by the UN overseers, who monitor the export program and advise the sanctions committee, to be about 60 cents per barrel below comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that Iraq was seeking from buyers.Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues, Iraq partially resumed exporting on December 13. Since then, about 1 mbd has been exported from the Mina al-Bakr terminal in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the shutdown, Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of 2.21 mbd for November, as compared with 2.08 mbd for the third quarter. Exports for November were about 1.3 mbd from Mina al-Bakr and about 0.9 mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed, owing to the surcharge dispute, with the result that about 1.2 mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market.Iraq's semi-shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues. (In the midst of this dispute, the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oil-for-food program at the last minute on December 5; it became effective on December 6 and has been accepted by Iraq). As of December19, Iraq's revised export price for Ceyhan, proposed for the remainder of December, has again been judged too low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions committee. Additionally, the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow account would be a violation of UN sanctions. Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina al-Bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a surcharge to Iraq.How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear, but it continues to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are the heart of the sanctions system. The distinction that Iraq has made between Mina al-Bakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina al-Bakr by loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company. Iraq may have judged this accommodation to be in its interest, since it recently also signed an oil exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil. As currently structured, the deal would violate UN sanctions, but India is seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic hardship. The exception seems unlikely to be granted, which may lead Iraq to cease exports from Mina al-Bakr again.There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow, but we expect uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security Council to end all restraints. Consequently, the Iraq factor will remain an element in the oil price outlook. Iraq's antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take office. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to \"reenergize\" sanctions. The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign policy-oriented think tank in Washington. A consensus seems to be emerging around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by retaining UN control over Iraq's oil revenue and strictly enforcing a prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international irritant. There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that the prospects for success are remote.Demand Trends Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so, and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas. Interruptible gas customers with resid or distillate fuel back-up have already switched to oil, so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the already high level of distillate demand. So far in December US distillate demand is running at a record high December level of 3.9 mbd. However, only a small portion of this demand is the result of economically based fuel-switching from gas to distillate. CERA estimates that the additional demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is relatively small, on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mbd. In CERA's view it is likely that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short notice because in some cases, this theoretically switchable capacity has not been used in recent years, and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in uncertain condition. Switching by interruptible gas customers (such as utilities) to distillate began about a month or more ago, although the volumes involved are relatively small. Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices started to surge in the summer. A portion of the US secondary and tertiary distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage. Given the expectations of a tight gas market, regulators have been explicit about enforcing back-up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the current heating season. Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching. Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost of feedstock natural gas is high. Natural gas is also used in some enhanced oil recovery operations, and some of these producers have also opted to sell gas back to the grid rather than produce oil. Supply Trends Non-OPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0.9 mbd over a year earlier at 46.4 mbd. Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican production, curtailed in October by about 3000,000 bd owing to the effects of Hurricane Keith. Mexico's fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 3.64 mbd-about 95 percent of Mexican liquids capacity. Norway's output increased 2000,000 bd from October to November as maintenance season ended. Norway's production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.53 mbd.*Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a recent surge in exports, in spite of higher export taxes. Russian exports of domestic oil production (excluding transit volumes) reached 2.5 mbd in November, after remaining fairly steady at about 2.35 mbd from July though October. Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2.5 mbd, 0.3 mbd greater than in the fourth quarter 1999.CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged 2.91 mbd in November-down 0.1 mbd from the October level. The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced Iraqi output for the first 12 days of December to roughly 0.8 mbd. Iraq resumed exports of about 1 mbd on December 13, which raised production to 1.80 mbd. Assuming no change in Iraq's current production stance, Iraqi production would average 1.41 mbd for December. On a quarterly basis, the decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth quarter of 29.0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0.5 mbd into a stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. These production estimates include 0.15 mbd of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November 20 without UN authorization and are continuing.Oil Stocks US crude oil inventories (DOE data) have climbed intermittently from an annual low of 280 million barrels in September and reached 292 million barrels in mid-December (see Figure 1). Since prices weakened in late November, crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September and the ranges seen in October to levels from 289-292 million barrels.Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below year-earlier levels; at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels, or 24 percent less, than those of a year ago, but there are indications of builds in secondary and tertiary inventories. We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 5-10 million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at the end of last year.In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with those of the United States. In November stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels to 426 million barrels. At this level they are below the highs of 1999 but well above the low levels of early 19996 (see Figure 2). Japanese crude oil inventories at end-October were 107.6 million barrels, which is above the record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent years (see Figure 3).*** Come Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek20001, \"Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for the Energy Future\" in Houston, February 12-16, 20001!?

I spent a great part of my professional career in the oil &amp; gas business.   Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can bring value to his team.   I have not gotten any response yet.As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for Enron:   Cement.   This industry can be transformed to the new economy and given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline.This is new for me but enormously challenging.   I am asking you to give me a chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.   I have enclosed a brief resume for your review.I look forward to meeting with you.   Thanks, Jeffken\n"

(de la Roche/Terlip - please be sure this gets sent to all attendees asap).This will be a very important process which we feel your input is critical and valuable.   I want to encourage everyone to not only attend but to be proactive in the process as well.   This will start as somewhat of a \"brainstorming\" session but our plan is to evolve into a definitive set of priorities, opportunities and action items which we hope will create value across both the trading and origination groups.   Given the size of the group, it has been very challenging finding a convenient time and place to accomodate everyone but I hope each of you will do what you can to attend.   We've purposefully started the meeting late to try and accomodate the traders' schedule needs.BETH:WE NEED TO GET EITHER A CONF ROOM (preferably) OR RESERVE A MEETING ROOM AT THE DOUBLETREE, HYATT OR WEDGE TOWER, ETC... FOR THIS MEETING.PLEASE CHECK THE DISTRIBUTION LIST ABOVE AND COMPARE AGAINST YOUR LIST OF ORIGINAL INVITES TO THIS MEETING.   IF I'VE MISSED SOMEONE, PLEASE BE SURE THEY ARE NOTIFIED OF THE CHANGE IN DATE, TIME AND PLACE.   ALSO, BE SURE TO LET MCKINSEY KNOW THE LOCATION AS WELL.\n"

First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers.From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I   met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural start date under   both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 111, 20002 for Oman and April 30, 20002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will   be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone number is 505/3336-84000.Clay\n"

I will ask him to take the two of you out of the details on this for now so that we don't overload your email inboxes, unless you want to see all of the details.I will screen the emails and forward you info to keep you in the loop but at a higher altitude without all of the gory details.Please advise \n"

Specifically,   Enron Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.   Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction projects around the world.   Historically, these projects have been a primary focus of EECC's activities.   Consequently we are making the following organizational changes concerning EECC:EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of Enron Transportation Services.   NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant construction services to Enron entities and third parties.The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.

Both the months of August and September included several very large OTC physical transactions which have not been seen so far this month.* Average daily volumes for ENA - Canada East Gas have increased considerably since September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical transactions, including a forward done with the Westcourt Group, Inc. which alone accounted for over 333,167,715 MMBtu's.   At the same time, the average daily   deal count has decreased slightly.* Average daily volumes for Central Gas have decreased considerably since September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical transactions, including three spot transactions done with the Trailblazer Pipeline Company and J. M. Huber Corporation.   Each of the three transactions alone accounted for over 140,630,000 MMBtu's.---The following files contain a graphical view of the average deal count and volumes per month by Commodity for EOL and OTC transactions since the launch of EnronOnline.

MTBE front month swap, U S Gulf fixed price.3. Cal 02 UNL gasoline crack spread (this one probably requires VAR increase)4. WTI swaps that match the timing of our gasoline and HO cracks. This gives customers the option to convert crack spread positions to fixed price gasoline and HO swaps through EOL.Regarding long dated gasoline positions we are long 75 kb per month cal 02 gulf coast gas cracks which probably won't move much in value until march/April 01. I view this position as very low risk and good profit potential but this position does tie up VAR. If marketing can sell at $3.80 or better happy to get out of this for now.

        " John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron on 10/18/2000 07:27 AM ---   \tEnron Technology \tFrom:   Darren P Adamik @ ECT   10/17/2000 09:04 AM To: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Kimberly Hillis/HOU/ECT@ect Subject: EnronCredit MoveJohn, I need your help again.   Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting to move to level 14.   There are several problems with this move.1.   This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to support them. a.   The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk). b.   Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more cabling for the turrets.   There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling c.   AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.   The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in late December.   Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 20001.2.   This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems. a.   Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.3.   The Response Time would be affected. a.   The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA trading floors.   A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.   Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group. b.   We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.   The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.4.   There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be susceptible to power outages.I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.   Level 29 has been completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.   This floor has been built out with Trading Desk furniture as well.My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; this will save the company both money and time.   Your help is needed to convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.Thanks,Darren AdamikMgr.-Trading TechnologyEnron Net Works713-853-4764\n"

Unfortunately, this pushes our customers to other systems that are consistently showing numbers (such as Altrade's Chalkboard).   Here are some comments that Jennifer McQuade and Beth Cowan have received over the past two weeks:NGL products (Jennifer McQuade):Products that come on and off-line throughout the day (or sometimes are never put out all day): Natural Gasoline (physical only), Normal Butane, Purity Ethane and Physical Conway Propane (Craig Story).   These products are less liquid and the traders (Wade Hicks- physical, Adam Gross-financial) find it difficult   to keep the products out all day.   However, Chalkboard (which has the LPG on-line market share) consistently has 4-5 postings in each of these products.   Companies that have commented on this include Dynegy, Gulfsream Trading, Huntsman Petrochemicals, and Taylor Gas Liquids.Lately, when one of the traders is out of the office, his products are not being posted (i.e. 12/14 Wade Hicks was out of the office and there were no physical Mt. Belvieu products).   The product details say these market are open from 7:000 am to 4:000 pm, but the products often don't come on until 8/8:30 and are often gone shortly after 2:000 pm.Crude/Products (Beth Cowan):Beth spoke with Kirk Kinnear at Hess Energy Trading Company LLC (2nd largest crude counterparty).   Kirk commented that we are posting various products but the hours that they trade are not consistent - he compares EOL to other exchanges where the numbers are up all day long.   JJohn Brewer at Occidental Energy Marketing said, \"we are interested mostly in the PT market &amp; West Texas but weren't seeing many quotes out there so I quit looking at it.\"US WTI Cal swap - should be online until 3:30 central - Rob FullerUS WTI Index products - should be onine until 3 - Rob FullerUS WTI Basis Products - should be online until 6 - Rob Fuller\n"

        " Douglas S Friedman/HOU/ECT on 01/16/20001 111:16 AM ---From: John Viverito@ENRON on 111/07/2000 10:14 AMTo: Douglas S Friedman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Engberg/HOU/ECT@ECT, Travis McCullough/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Greenberg/NA/Enron@ENRONcc: Michael A Robison/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject:   EnronOnline / EnveraAll-Pursuant to our meeting yesterday, regarding the captioned matter, I have prepared a brief summary of the general issues, which are likely to be of interest to EOL and may be discussed in the meeting today with Andy Zipper.Please feel free to add any points that you deem appropriate.1.   The Links:A link from Envera's site to EOL will be created.   The link would only be to the home page of EOL.   There would be no effect upon normal EOL vetting procedures for counterparties.A link from Envera's site to Deal Bench will be created.   Again the link would only be to the home page of Deal Bench.   The Envera member companies would be required to follow normal Deal Bench registration of participants, however, such parties during 1Q 2000, would be permitted to engage in two free transactions on Deal Bench, with a maximum of 25 such free transactions in total. Presently, it is still under consideration as to whether such access would be to the auction area, or the collaboration area, or some variation thereof.   The fees to be charged post 1Q 2000 are under consideration.2.   TradesOn a case-by-case basis, with no preexisting commitment, EGM would consider requests from Envera customers to make trades on a contingent basis on EOL.   In the event that such trade is considered promising, then such pricing would be posted on EOL.   This would be free for the first 12 months, but thereafter such service would be provided for a fee.3.   Envera Membership and Enron Services as Consideration for Envera EquityEGM would pay between $3000-5000k for the ability to utilize the Envera hub to do deals for the period of [one year].Some portion of the fee may also be considered as payment for equity in Envera LLC.   The Enron services provided (points 1. and 2. above, as well as access to Enron risk management and utility outsourcing ) will also be considered as payment for some portion of the Envera LLC equity.   The total equity received, is anticipated to be around five percent and the capitalization of the company is believed to be around $50,000,000.   The breakdown for the consideration for the equity still needs to be reviewed from the accounting side.4.   Board Seat ConsiderationsDiscussion regarding Enron obtaining an Envera Board seat has been discussed.   The fiduciary risks need to be considered, as we may be restricted in competing with Envera, unless certain steps are taken.   For example, if Commodity Logic were to be considered a competitor to Envera, unless we had the specific right to compete we could be subject to suit by Envera.   These risks may be negated through negotiation.   The upside here would be the ability to have access to executives of certain petrochemical companies who are also shareholders in Envera and have Board seats.   It is believed that this type of access would likely lead to more deals for EGM and potentially for other Enron entities.Unrelated to the Board seat, other promotional activities relating to Enron's services are foreseen through activities at Trade Shows and other networking venues.5.   Building Connectivity Between Envera and EnronIt will be necessary to consider what activities, from the technical side, would be undertaken by Envera and what activities would be undertaken by Enron, to achieve the stated objectives, i.e. linking.6.   Press ReleaseEnvera is likely to want to make a public statement regarding this transaction with Enron.   The restrictions on the scope of such announcement must be considered.I hope this is helpful.John---",

The purpose of this\"Other Enron Services\" agenda item is simply to take the opportunity to summarize the multitude of services offered by Enron for those in attendance who may not be familiar with some or all of these services.   Accordingly, I'm in the process of gathering information on the various services Enron has to offer and, in particular, slides/viewgraphs covering the services offered by your company which may already exist in order not to have to duplicate prior efforts.

Overall temperatures should be normal to below normal in the February and March timeframe.   An active sub-tropical jetstream will continue to provide a wet pattern near the Mediterranean keeping temperatures on the below side of normal.   Western Europe will also see the best chances for colder weather intrusions as the NAO trends positive.   Even with this cooler trend across Europe, there are no signs that the Arctic Pool of air in Siberia will move westward toward eastern Europe.   Overall no extreme deviations from normal are expected, only a slight trend toward cooler than normal.Let me Know if there is more we can do:SteveStephen BennettMeteorologist - ResearchEnron Americas(713) 345-36661stephen.bennett@enron.com\n"

(FGPC) liquid fuel supply transaction involves a 1000 MW (two power blocks of 5000 MW each) combined cycle land based power plant located on the island of Luzon in the Republic of the Philippines. In May, 19997 Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources International Corp. (ECTRI) entered into a fuel supply contract with FGPC to start delivering either condensate, naphtha or gasoil to the first power block of 5000 MW due online in June, 1999. ECTRI subsequently assigned the fuel contract to Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Singapore (ECTRS). Fuel deliveries were projected at 40.7 million barrels over the following 43 months through December 20002. NPV origination of $15.2 million was granted to Enron International (EI) and after prudency/credit reserve the book amount given to EI was $111.3 million. ECTRS and EI agreed to a \"true-up\" mechanism that would compensate either party in the event of a   mismatch between the actual volumes delivered and the MTM volumes. Fuel deliveries did not start until April 2000 and have not been at the MTM volume of 31,050 barrel per day. To put it in perspective, FGPC should have taken delivery on 14.2 million barrels by now and they have only ordered 0.9 million, a shortfall of 13.3 million barrels. This shortfall, as a result of the delayed plant start-up and reduced consumption, has caused the ECTRS books to currently have a $6.1 million receivable through the end of August, 2000. The plant is currently consuming 10,000-12,000 barrels per day, which means the receivable will continue to increase until the consumption reaches the expected MTM volume. When ECTRS approached EI Asia Pacific for the true-up amount we were stonewalled. Following many months of discussion with EI about the receivable,   Enron Corp. reorganized EI into global regions, one of which was Asia Pacific (APACHI). APACHI said it was not their deal, nor had they ever benefited from the deal since the MTM revenue originally went to EI and they didn't have money in their budget to return funds to ECTRS, regardless of the true-up agreement. Subsequently, Global Fuels meet with Rick Buy to discuss this matter. Rick recognized and agreed with our book problem, but indicated that Enron Corp. was not prepared to remedy the situation. We have been waiting for Corp.'s help ever since.   ECTRS did not do anything wrong and yet their books have suffered the consequences of a project not living up to it's original estimate. How can Enron operating groups grant MTM origination across company lines and not expect those regions and projects to live up to the original MTM volumes, term and margins granted? \n"

Capes saw majority of strength in Pacific with Intra Pacific rates rising around $18000 since last week. Late surge in Japanese buying ahead of the close of their financial year is main reason attributed to this rise. Atlantic Capesize been pretty flat to marginally better, no exciting news. Outlook for coming week is that Far East strength will be maintained although pace definitely slowing. No change sentiment in Pacific.Panamax has seen opposite effect, grain stems finally rolling from S America which has been the major driver of the Atlantic market, for March loaders. market was under impression that Pacific likely to come under downward pressure but once the demand has been strong enough epecially for modern tonnage and outlook for coming week is that reates are likely to maintain firmness. Atlantic expected continue run for next week.Short term we have established small long for nearby Capes, but maintain overall perspective to sell forward curve on appreciable rallies. Panamax very similar approach.Panamax we fixed timecharter tonnage to cover 14 / 26 Mch Dreyfus Ist nomination USG / Far East grain cargo.

Owners are still quite concerned about the year as a whole and are actively seeking coverage.   We spend much of last week covering all our short positions thru to May.   Plan is to sit back for a couple weeks and then sell short again for Q2, Q3 and Q4 if feasible.   We struck a deal last Friday with Cetragpa ( Pierre's ex co. ) by which we agreed a collar on the RBCT/Rotterdam route for 20002/20003.

The bounce is expected to be gentle and not long lasting.   Owners are raising their rates for March cargoes as there appears to be a few more cargoes around mostly attributed to the fact that Japanese steel mills expect coal and Iron Ore prices for this year to increase and are therefore maximising their current contracts.   Furthermore, Bunkers have risen sharply over the last 10 days to over $130 in Rotterdam which was not expected by the market.   Of interest, Bocimar is redelivering ships it had taken on short period last year back to the head owner earlier than their contract allows for which has a few owners thinking about suing Bocimar for damages.   The panamax atlantic market has been falling hard over the last week with little grain movement from the US gulf and fresh Japanese concerns of GM crops imports from the US.   However, the Plate season is expected to start in March and market anticipates a return to healthy rates then.   The pacific is also falling from incredibly strong rates seen three weeks ago before the Chinese new year.On the long term time charter with Mitsui, Mitsui has officially lifted their board of approval subjects and we are working through the internal documentation/proper sign off at this stage.   We have offered some competitive freight rates to the US steel group to import steel slabs from Turkey to US in the hope of providing the freight for this business when it happens.   Pierre is meeting with the pulp and paper guys while in Houston at the end of Feb and also going through NYC to meet up with the Enron metals shipping guy to discuss joint efforts in shipping to maximise synergy's and cost savings.

We are currently evaluating taking another cape on short period or fixing a COA with a distressed owner for our Q2 cargoes out of RBCT or Colombia or both.   The average earnings for a cape has fallen from a high of $25,000 in November to $18,5000 today.   Pierre is in Japan next week and should get a good feel as to what the Japanese steel mills are up to and what kind of opportunities are out there for us to concentrate on.   Panamaxes as anticipated are very difficult to read with close to zero Far East biz. Atlantic very short term has slight imbalance of tonnage but backed by very good USDA corn sales yesterday, the grain will start to role by end Feb. Paper rates have remained stagnant again lacking real physical input, nearbys marginally easier forwards flat neglected. Strategy will either be to bear spread where nearby premiums are good or bide our time and buy Q2 dips or calls.The story out of Bocimar this week is that they view this year as being definitely weaker than last year and that they feel it should average around $15,000 to $17,000 for the year ( which is still a good market for shipping ) and at those levels, they are happy to sit back and watch.   Furthermore, last week CMB ( parent company of Bocimar ) released their earnings for cal 000.   Their Dry bulk division made 60 million Euro and their tanker division made 60 million as well.   These are very good numbers for their dry bulk division taking into account the incredible rise in bunkers last year ( cost of fuelling the ships ) and the fact that their ships were often at anchor and not generating revenues.On the funny side of things, Coeclerici is having their yearly audit by Arthur Anderson and AA has discovered that although Coeclerici makes money trading FFA's, they lack proper daily position reports and models to value options.   As a result, I got a call from Koert ( head shipping at Coaclerici ) asking for our assistance as AA had mentioned to them that they should talk to us about our systems and procedures.   Being that Coeclerici is our biggest counterpart, we jumped on the opportunity to assist and Andy James is being sent to genoa Tuesday for a one day tutorial about risk controls and procedures while trying at the same time to better understand how Coeclerici values deals, which needless to say should help us in the future when negotiating with them.

Richards bay to Rotterdam rates have fallen about $2 in 45 days ( key coal route )   and Brazil to China rates have fallen $3 in the same period ( key iron ore route ) which has owners running for cargo   coverage.   However charterers smell blood and are not willing to enter into freight contracts ( Edf trading and NCSC   are playing spot and so are we ).   Even the mighty Bocimar seems unable to turn the tide and are offering us cheap rates on the quiet as they keep playing their vessels spot and are   being run over.   The average cape rate has lost $ 42000 from its peak and hangs around $20,4000 presently.   To get cargo contracts for the balance of the year an owner has to fix his vessel at around $16,000 to get charterers willing to agree.   The downward fall is the result of two concurrent market shifts 1- coal shipments into Europe have slowed 2- market is predicting that sometime in Q1 20001 , Japanese steel mills will cut back on production and reduce their raw material imports.   As a result, you have on one side, Japanese vessel owners panicking as they fear that their main account ( Japan ) will not need their vessels shortly and you have the European owners also worried as they are seeing their utilities postponing their coal requirements.   Furthermore, the holiday season in Asia is approaching and little activity is predicted for the next few weeks.On the panamax front, the outlook is still very bleak as you now have about two new buildings being launched per week in a market which is currently well balanced.   In the spot market, the Atlantic is weak as the grain out of the US gulf is slow as the main rivers are frozen upstream and the vessels have little to load.   In the east the market is strong as there is a flurry of grain activity but in the paper market, February is already traded at a big discount to Jan as people predict a quick slowdown in the activity as Asia goes on holiday.On the long term strucutred front, last week we agreed to charter a new cape building starting in late 20003 for 10 years with an option for an 111th, 12 th, 13 th and 14 th year.   Furthermore, we have the option to buy the vessel after year 3 at a fixed agreed Japanese yen amount ( if currency goes our way, we buy the vessel dirt cheap !!!).   The counterparty in Mitsui, a big and financially strong Japanese company.   The deal is still subject a few details but we hope to be able to book this deal within the next 5 months when the ship building contract will be drawn up.Also last week we had about 6 banks over a period of three days come to our office to discuss possible opportunities in the shipping world and to get them to trade on EOL.   Larry Lawyer and Simon Crowe organized the meetings and we expect a few of these leads to pay off sometime this year.Market\tShort term\tMedium term\tLong TermHandy Max\tDown\tDown\tDownPanamax\tFlat\tFlat\tDownCape Size\tDown\tDown\tDownCapeAverage time charter rate: $ 20,4000Spot RBCT/Rotterdam: $ 9.30Spot Tubaro/China: $111.30Spot Bolivar/Rotterdam: $ 7.35PanamaxAverage time charter rate: $ 111,2000Spot US Gulf/Japan: $21.20Deals DonePhysical FreightECS freight Fixed a Cape from Keoyang from RBCT/Hunterstone at $9.40Fixed a Panamax from Norden from Drummond/Liverpool at $ 8.50Fixed a Panamax from Transfield from Santa marta to Hit at $10.20Fixed out a panamax to transfield on time charter which was spot open in US gulfThird parties freight dealsSold 4 Cape cargoes to Eastern Rich from Brazil to China at $9.80OTC FFA sNumerous swaps on both the Cape and Panamax routes EOLTraded with Cargill, Edf trading, Navios and have now traded over 3 million tons LTDTravelsPierre will be in Paris on Monday but Andy and I should be in all week.Chris\n"

Panamaxes have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.   Most bundits think that this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.   The Japanese buyers and the US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news of resumed shipping.   When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market quickly reversed trend and starting going up.   With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining positions quickly.

The news from Japan and the Asian economies as a whole is bleak with fear of more bankruptcies looming and low to flat growth projections. Furthermore, the US economy is showing strong signs that it has peaked.   As a result, ship owners are openly worried about demand for next year and are desperately seeking cargo contracts while rates are still attractive.   The cape time charter rate has lost more than $ 3,000 over the last 3 weeks and Panamaxes have lost $ 1,5000.   On the cape side, Bocimar is unable to prevent the index sliding even though they still control 60 ships ( on Friday index fell 333 pts, single biggest point drop ever recorded ) and other owners are fighting for the few spot cargoes still unfixed before the Christmas break. Of significance, we fixed on subs a four cargo contract with Bao Steel ( one of the biggest Chinese steel mills ) that runs into March 20002 from Brazil into China and also fixed a a four panamax contract with Adaro from Indonesia to Spain, which is on subs until or if Adaro sells the coal into Spain.Market\tShort term\tMedium term\tLong TermHandy Max\tDown\tDown\tDownPanamax\tDown\tDown\tDownCape Size\tDown\tDown\tDownDeals DonePhysical FreightECS freight Fixed a RBCT to Redcar cape with Coeclerici for Jan loadingThird parties freight dealsFixed on Subs with Bao Steel &amp; AdaroOTC FFA sNumerous swaps on both the Cape and Panamax routes EOLTraded 27,000 tons of Panamax US Gulf/Japan with Louis Dreyfus and 75,000 tons of RBCT/Rott with CargillTravelsAll three of us should be in all week\n"

For next year, owners have turned on average quite bearish and several are calling us directly to offer us their vessels at discounted numbers.   Interestingly, cape vessel owners have been watching the falling panamax market with trepidation.   Currently, the spread between the two sectors is about $13,000.   Over the last three days, time charter rates for cape size vessel for 12 months starting in January 20001 have dropped by approximately $12000 and brokers attribute the rapid decline to the unsustainable spread between the two vessel types.Of significant interest this week, Bocimar called us to price put options for them.   They told us that they wanted some protection for next year but could not buy puts or sell swaps in the market place for fear of creating a panic selling mode from owners.   We offered them some prices which they told us were too expensive but we are still in discussion.   Our problem is that we do not want to diminish our short position for next year so in offering put options to Bocimar, we also want to keep selling the underlying - and that might be challenging as the market is very illiquid and there are not too many bids for next year at good selling numbers.We are currently continuing to build a short position on panamaxes and are offering rates to AK Steel from Brazil to US gulf for their iron ore contracts and also offering Sidmar ( the Belgian steel mill ) some rates from Brazil into Gent.   We might join forces with Coeclerici on several of these tenders to mitigate the risk and also to share market information.last but not least, we are studying the idea of taking a cape new building delivery 20003/20004 on time charter for 8 years with ability to extend for three additional years and the ability to buy the vessel after year three in Japanese yen.   The time charter rate is very attractive when compared to the average time charter rate of this size vessel over the last 5 and 10 years.

As for next year, the cape market is still trading at robust numbers but the sentiment on the panamax market has definitely turned bearish as the massive new order of vessels and the lack of grain cargoes from the US is front page news everywhere.   We are now starting to see big grain houses really starting to sell the panamax freight market for next year.   We are also having several large owners calling us directly over the last few days to try to convince us to take their tonnage for next year or fix COA's.   We are short approximatly 45 pananamx cargoes world wide next year.The long term Coeclerici deal was finally concluded this week and booked for $1.3 Million.   We have another smaller deal with Coeclerici which we will put into the books within next week and are looking currently at repeating the same strategy on a smaller panamax vessel to be delivered in 20003/20004 with a purchase option included in the deal.   Last week we added to our short panamax position for next year by agreeing to sell an additional 6 panamax cargoes to National Power ( now called Innogy ).

The driving factor has not been coal as of late, but an unexpected rush of Iron Ore cargoes.   On the panamax front, rates have been easing for the last few weeks, as the expected strong grain activity in the US gulf as not yet materialised.   The average time charter rate on capes is now in excess of $25,000 daily and close to $111,000 on panamaxes.   The general view in the market is that prices for both capes and panamaxes will remain strong though to April/May 20001 by which time steel mills will have reduced raw material imports and adversely affected cape rates and the shear number of newbuildings on the panamax front will drag earnings down as well.   Our group tends to believe that the balance of the year will see yet firmer rates but we expect a slow down and a decrease in rates to take effect towards the first two months of next year as we already are seeing some owners desperately seeking to cover themselves for next year at very aggressive numbers ( Hadeed contract ) and we are getting the feeling that Bocimar is keenly interested to cover their long position even tough their length is mainly through March/April next year.   Furthernore, the asian owners seem more and more agressive with rates for next year as their countries are hitting some rough patches currently, as evidenced by their stock markets and strong comments against continued strong crude oil prices.On the ABC front, it appears as if Zodiac and P&amp;O have agreed in principal to a deal by which Zodiac buys 50% of ABC but gets full control of the company.   Details are still patchy and we are keeping a close eye on the possibility of Zodiac putting their newly acquired vessels into the Bocimar pool as that would have a drastic bullish effect on rates for some months to come.   We have proposed to Bocimar a 5 year collar deal by which we get access to 5 million tons of freight each year with ability to settle the collar deal against an index and have the ability to call upon physical tonnage each year.   Furthermore, we would have ability to have a washout clause for each year by which we would pay a fix lump sum cash amount.   We have also built in several other options and we are waiting for an answer from Bocimar sometime next week.   This deal would offer us access to modern vessels at a price similar to that of the cape index of the last 10 years and with enough built in options to take advantage of any sudden market changes.On the logistics front, Coeclerici is coming in next week to make a presentation on their port handling operations in India/ Indonesia and Venezuela with the idea of teaming up with us on forthcoming tenders where we would offer the long term coal contracts into or out of certain ports, as the case maybe, and they would build and manage the port operations.   They currently have some interesting contracts in Indonesian ports which should have special interest to us vis a vis CLP.   Our two cape deals with Coeclerici are still not finalised as we are still having a few issues with credit language but expect the deals to close within the next 10 days.On the EOL front, Andy James has been able to get EDFtrading to trade 2225,000 tons of freight via EOL this week and he has added Louis Dreyfus grain and Billiton and RWE trading to the list of customers that have trading authority on our system.Regarding the lighter side of business, Enron dry bulk shipping was featured in tradewinds, a weekly shipping   newspaper, with 3 pages dedicated to our rapid growth and clever insights.Market\tShort term\tMedium term\tLong TermHandy Max\tUp\tFlat\tFlatPanamax\tFlat\tDown\tDownCape Size\tUp\tUp\tFlatDeals DonePhysical FreightECS freight Fixed a panamax for early December loading from Puerto Drummond to LBTThird parties freight dealsStill negotiating a 6 panamax deal with EDF trading from Richards Bay to Le Havre for all of next year and looking to sell freight to Preag from KPC to Rotterdam for similar period.OTC FFA sVery active week in which we transacted with Coeclerici on both Capes and Panamaxes routes and traded with Jinhui and Conagra on Panaamxes as well.

We are still trying to conclude our two structured deals with Coeclerici, but have run into problems as counterpart is not keen on agreeing our credit terms.   We are meeting with Coeclerici during Coaltrans to try and sort out a compromise and will also try to get our credit department to be more flexible with our terms as we need to adapt our terms to the shipping industry or face the possibility that no one will want to transact on our strict terms.   This week the liquids group launched their tanker route on EOL and asked Andy ( our EOL freight trader ) to manage it full time.   Within the first two days, 4000,000 tons had been traded.We have tendered for a contract covering two years to ship iron ore from Basil to Saudi Arabia starting in Jan next year for the account of Hadeed.   If we were to win the contract, it would fit very well with our short position out of Richards Bay as it would allow us to fix a vessel on time charter from Europe to Brasil, then go to Saudi arabia to discharge and then continue onto Richards bay to load coal.   The net result of having the hadeed contract would be to save 15 days ballast sailing which in terms of dollars would equate to $250.000 saving per trip Market\tShort term\tMedium term\tLong TermHandy Max\tUp\tFlat\tFlatPanamax\tUp\tDown\tDownCape Size\tUp\tUp\tFlatDeals DonePhysical FreightECS freight Fixed a panamax for early November loading from Puerto bolivar to ImminghamThird parties freight dealsFixed a cape for late november loading out of RBCT to Rotterdam at $111.17 for Preag.OTC FFA sBought a Us gulf/Japan contract for November from Conagra and a 4 TC contract from Andre for Q4 &amp; Q1 01.

In the cape market, rates continue to increase across the board with a rush of new cargoes being quoted in the market ( EDF trading leading the pack ).   Glencore and Anglo came into the market this week looking for 1 year freight rates into the UK for the BE tender with more mines expected to look for rates next week.   We had another visit from Bocimar this week as they wanted to meet the guys from MG to discuss hedging some of their freight exposure with aluminium which has a 75% correlation with the cape freight market.   Furthermore, they wanted to start trading coal in ARA and tanker freight which should be going live next week on EOL .On the ABC front, we are hearing that they are in negotiations with Zodiac, another cape owner, but do not know the time frame of any potential deal.   We had this week a call from Coeclerici asking us if we were interested in joining forces in buying ABC so this makes a total of 4 companies having approached us asking to team up and as a result, we plan on exploring the potential of creating a consortium of buyers for ABC.Market\tShort term\tMedium term\tLong TermHandy Max\tDown\tFlat\tFlatPanamax\tDown\tDown\tDownCape Size\tUp\tUp\tFlatBunkers:   With events in the middle east and continued low stocks of Gasoline in the US, the Fuel Oil/Bunker market is rocketing upwards with an increase of $30 per ton in Rotterdam in 10 days.

From meeting it became very clear that they were out of the running for ABC as they were unwilling to purchase that company without a significant discount to current market levels.   Few days later, met with CEO of ABC as he had just received a bid from a rival shipping company ( Zodiac ) and he was basically begging us to join the bidding as he really did not want his company   to fall in the hands of Zodiac.   Pierre and I continued to express our interest in ABC but told him that we needed more time to evaluate their assets and could not counter on such short notice.   Told ABC that we would continue to follow with interest and that if buy out by Zodiac failed, we would come back to discuss.   Our goal all along was to make sure that Bocimar were not going to get their hands on ABC or they would have effectively controlled 50 % of the spot cape fleet and made our short position into next year look worrisome.   Having shown interest we not only were kept well advised as to what Bocimar was up to but it could have reacted quickly to protect our position.   We are relatively pleased with the potential of Zodiac buying ABC. Also, this week we fixed another Coeclerici cape for period.   We fixed the cape Asia build in 19990 for minimum 4-6 months to allow us to use the vessel to load out of Australia for CLP in December and hedge ourselves against a late winter surge in cape rates but we have the added advantage of having an option for a further two years to be declared mid January 20001.   We bought ourselves a very cheap call option with an exercise date in three months time in a very volatile market.   Further, Coeclerici gave us a put in year two to cap our downside and gave us a call option to extend the deal into an additional third year .   We are currently discussing with Bocimar the idea of putting that cape into their pool if they secure us a floor for year one and a share in any upside.   Will keep you posted   !!!Fixed a 6 panamax contract as vessel owner with National power from South Africa to Bristol with option Immingham to give us a very useful short position into next year in the panamax sector.   This deal will add to our already significant business in South Africa for next year and will allow us to arbitrage between cape and panamax vessels as we hold contracts in both sectors.   Furthermore, Intercore has asked us to offer them 6 capes from Bolivar into ARA from next March till September which if we were to win the contract would make us a definite market maker in the two busiest coal routes ( RBCT/ARA and COLOMBIA/ARA ).

Still have a late November short against Cargill from Richards Bay to Rotterdam to cover within the next couple weeks.On the ABC front, met with Elcano ( largest Spanish shipping company ) to discuss a possible partnership to acquire ABC but quickly realised that they do not have the stomach for such a big deal.   However, did discover that they are quite active on the LNG side and are about to close on a LNG vessel purchase within the next couple weeks.   We are definitely going to stay in contact to potentially develop some alliances on the LNG side.Late in the week heard that Bocimar had met with ABC not to purchase them but to discuss a pooling agreement.   From good sources were told that ABC had no interest in Bocimar's offer and therefore we are planning on meeting ABC to continue to express our interest in acquiring their fleet and more importantly to continue to frustrate Bocimars'attempt to control the cape fleet.   We have completed our 'Enron Shipping' powerpoint presentation for EOL and we expect to have a shipping section within the EOL platform by mid next month in time for Coaltrans.   This new platform will allow our customers to log into EOL and go directly to our shipping web page to be able to trade with us.

Gore. Can you explain it to me?A: Sure. I'm a lawyer. I read it. It says Bush wins, even if Gore got themost votes.Q: But wait a second. The US Supreme Court has to give a reason, right?A: Right.Q: So Bush wins because hand-counts are illegal?A: Oh no. Six of the justices (two-thirds majority) believed the hand-countswere legal and should be done.Q: Oh. So the justices did not believe that the hand-counts would find anylegal ballots?A. Nope. The five conservative justices clearly held (and all nine justicesagreed) \"that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunatenumber of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by thevoter.\" So there are legal votes that should be counted but can't be.Q: Oh. Does this have something to do with states' rights? Don'tconservatives love that?A: Generally yes. These five justices have held that the federal governmenthas no business telling a sovereign state university it can't steal tradesecrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law. Nor does thefederal government have any business telling a state that it should bar gunsin schools. Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clauseto force states to take measures to stop violence against women.Q: Is there an exception in this case?A: Yes, the Gore exception. States have no rights to have their own stateelections when it can result in Gore being elected President. This decisionis limited to only this situation.Q: C'mon. The Supremes didn't really say that. You're exaggerating.A: Nope. They held \"Our consideration is limited to the presentcircumstances, or the problem of equal protection in election processesgenerally presents many complexities.\"Q: What complexities?A: They don't say.Q: I'll bet I know the reason. I heard Jim Baker say this. The votes can'tbe counted because the Florida Supreme Court \"changed the rules of theelection after it was held.\" Right?A. Dead wrong. The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida SupremeCourt did not change the rules of the election. But the US Supreme Courtfound the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong.Q: Huh?A: The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting voteis \"clear intent of the voter.\" The Florida Court was condemned for notadopting a clearer standard.Q: I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislature'slaw after the election.A: Right.Q: So what's the problem?A: They should have. The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Courtshould have \"adopt[ed] adequate statewide standards for determining what isa legal vote\"Q: I thought only the Legislature could \"adopt\" new law.A: Right.Q: So if the Court had adopted new standards, I thought it would have beenoverturned.A: Right. You're catching on.Q: If the Court had adopted new standards, it would have been overturned forchanging the rules. And if it didn't, it's overturned for not changing therules. That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did, legalvotes could never be counted.A: Right. Next question.Q: Wait, wait. I thought the problem was \"equal protection,\" that somecounties counted votes differently from others. Isn't that a problem?A: It sure is. Across the nation, we vote in a hodgepodge of systems. Some,like the optical-scanners in largely Republican-leaning counties record999.7% of the votes. Some, like the punchcard systems in largelyDemocratic-leaning counties record only 97% of the votes. So approximately3% of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can.Q: Aha! That's a severe equal-protection problem!!!A: No it's not. The Supreme Court wasn't worried about the 3% of Democraticballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida. That \"complexity\" was not aproblem.Q: Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked morethan 20,000 Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan.A: Nope. The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got hishighest, best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home withHolocaust survivors, who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler.Q: Yikes. So what was the serious equal protection problem?A: The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the 3% of Democrats(largely African-American) disenfranchised. The problem is that somewhatless than .0005% of the ballots may have been determined under slightlydifferent standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing theirbest to accomplish the legislative mandate of \"clear intent of the voter\"may have a slightly opinion about the voter's intent.Q: Hmm. OK, so if those votes are thrown out, you can still count the voteswhere everyone agrees the voter's intent is clear?A: Nope.Q: Why not?A: No time.Q: No time to count legal votes where everyone, even Republicans, agree theintent is clear? Why not?A: Because December 12 was yesterday.Q: Is December 12 a deadline for counting votes?A: No. January 6 is the deadline. In 1960, Hawaii's votes weren't counteduntil January 4.Q: So why is December 12 important?A: December 12 is a deadline by which Congress can't challenge the results.Q: What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court?A: Nothing.Q: But I thought ---A: The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete itswork by December 12 to make things easier for Congress. The United StatesSupreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing theFlorida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding.Q: But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votescounted by December 12.A: They would have made it, but the five conservative justices stopped therecount last Saturday.Q: Why?A: Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal.Q: So why not separate the votes into piles, indentations for Gore, hangingchads for Bush, votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or theother so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won?Then, if some ballots (say, indentations) have to be thrown out, theAmerican people will know right away who won Florida.A. Great idea! The US Supreme Court rejected it. They held that such countswould likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gore's winningwould cause \"public acceptance\" and that would \"cast[] a cloud\" over Bush's\"legitimacy\" that would harm \"democratic stability.\"Q: In other words, if America knows the truth that Gore won, they won'taccept the US Supreme Court overturning Gore's victory?A: Yes.Q: Is that a legal reason to stop recounts? or a political one?A: Let's just say in all of American history and all of American law, thisreason has no basis in law. But that doesn't stop the five conservativesfrom creating new law out of thin air.Q: Aren't these conservative justices against judicial activism?A: Yes, when liberal judges are perceived to have done it.Q: Well, if the December 12 deadline is not binding, why not count thevotes?A: The US Supreme Court, after admitting the December 12 deadline is notbinding, set December 12 as a binding deadline at 10 p.m. on December 12.Q: Didn't the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court forarbitrarily setting a deadline?A: Yes.Q: But, but ---A: Not to worry. The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it setsfor other courts.Q: So who caused Florida to miss the December 12 deadline?A: The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount, therent-a-mob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidatingofficials, and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recountQ: So who is punished for this behavior?A: Gore, of course.Q: Tell me this: Florida's laws are unconstitutional?A: YesQ: And the laws of 50 states that allow votes to be cast or counteddifferently are unconstitutional?A: Yes. And 333 states have the \"clear intent of the voter\" standard that theUS Supreme Court found was illegal in FloridaQ: Then why aren't the results of 333 states thrown out?A: Um. Because---um---...the Supreme Court doesn't say---Q: But if Florida's certification includes counts expressly declared by theUS Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we don't know who really won theelection there, right?A: Right. Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore wonFlorida by about 20,000 votes (excluding the butterfly ballot errors)Q: So, what do we do, have a re-vote? throw out the entire state? countunder a single uniform standard?A: No. We just don't count the votes that favor Gore.Q: That's completely bizarre! That sounds like rank political favoritism!Did the justices have any financial interest in the case?A: Scalia's two sons are both lawyers working for Bush. Thomas's wife iscollecting applications for people who want to work in the Bushadministration.Q: Why didn't they recuse themselves?A: If either had recused himself, the vote would be 4-4, and the FloridaSupreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed.Q: I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way.A: Read the opinions for yourself:http:///frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/000-949_dec12.pdf (December 9stay stopping the recount)http:///www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/000pdf/000-949.pdf (December 12opinion)Q: So what are the consequences of this?A: The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under ourConstitution (Al Gore) will lose to America's second choice who won the allimportant 5-4 Supreme Court vote.Q: I thought in a democracy, the guy with the most votes wins.A: True, in a democracy. But America is not a democracy. In America in 2000,the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins.Q: So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President?A: He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensurethat the will of the people is less and less respected. Soon lawlessjustices may constitute 6-3 or even 7-2 on the court.Q: Is there any way to stop this?A: YES. No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate. Ittakes 60 votes to break a filibuster. If only 41 of the 50 DemocraticSenators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will notapprove a single judge appointed by him until a President can bedemocratically elected in 20004, the judicial reign of terror can end...andone day we can hope to return to the rule of law.Q: What do I do now?A: Email this to everyone you know, and write or call your senator,reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes (threetimes Kennedy's margin over Nixon) and that you believe that VOTERS ratherthan JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote.And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people, youwant them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until 20004 when a president is finallychosen by most of the American people.Mark H. Levine Attorney at Law\n"

As a side note they are normally right about the Iraqi situation but last year they did have vessels waiting at Mina al Bakr when the Iraqis cancelled loadings.

The worst-case scenario now seen is a very brief \"hiccup\" in exports for a period of 1-3 days as the euro account is created and the letters of credit are arranged for November liftings.Sources report that Saudi Arabia has reconciled its internal differences and now favors an OPEC production increase of 5000,000 b/d according to the \"trigger mechanism.\"   It is expected that the decision to increase output will be announced on Friday October 27 or Monday October 30.\n"

As we have discussed we are in the process of identifying a strategy and forming a team to lead our Asian coal efforts.   We view continental Europe and Japan / Asia as the next areas of growth for our group.   One of our greatest challenges has been identifying and attracting to our group the best \"Enron\" people, and strong industry players.   We have made some progress with the recent addition in Houston of 3 - excellent mid-marketers with industry backgrounds.   However we are still in the process of building a strong European organization, and staffing Sydney with a core group of Enron traders and industry mid-marketers.   Clearly Japan represents the single largest market for coal in Asia.   The other major markets are Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and to a degree India.   The largest coal exporters in the region are Australia, Indonesia, China and Russia.   Our staffing strategy for Asia is to initially build a core trading and marketing group centered around 2 - 3 experienced \"Enron\" guys in Sydney, add   mid-marketers with industry experience in Sydney and Tokyo, and hire   2 - locals in China to look after our deliveries from PRC suppliers.   Our experience to date has shown that industry guys orphaned in a regional office face certain failure. As a result we are trying to avoid the mistake we have made in the past of hiring local industry players, and then failing to provide them with proper direction and support. We are on target to relocate at least 2 - \"Enron\" guys to Sydney by Jan - Feb.   We will continue to search for strong industry guys in Sydney, and make any necessary changes to our existing structure there.   We have not yet started to identify qualified people with industry experience in Tokyo - but will obviously do so.   I will get with Stu and Joe to discuss using a local head-hunter, and advertising in trade journals etc.We share your views on our potential for growth in Asia and Japan, and are working to put a team in place that will be focused on developing a strongly competitive, sustainable   business in the region.   Our initial goal is to develop Asia to the point where Sydney is running it's own books for both coal and freight, and we are a major supplier in the region.Stu and I will be in Hong Kong and Beijing Oct.   7 - 111 to meet with the Chairman of Shenua Coal, and senior management of Shanxi Coal, China Light &amp; Power, and Hong Kong Electric.   The primary purpose of the trip is to encourage Shenua to perform in accordance with their obligations under our supply agreement; introduce ourselves to Shanxi; assure CLP that we will perform under our term sales agreement; and start negotiations with HKE for a term sales contract.I will coordinate my schedule with Joe, and will spend a few days in Tokyo (Oct. 12 - 13) at the end of the PRC trip.   We can coordinate our efforts, put a time line in place for staffing the Tokyo office with qualified coal guys, and discuss our overall strategy for entering the Japanese market.I will be in the office Mon. - Weds., and am available to meet with you and Jeff to discuss the above at your convenience.   Thanks,George\n"

This year's offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.   We picked these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on \"mark to market\" mechanics, the LNG \"book\", enron online and any other similar topics that may be appropriate.   To that end, we are working on the following agenda:Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:   Mick Mcconnell/Jeff ShankmanLNG organization and strategic objectives:   Rick Bergsieker/Eric GonzalesLNG risk book:   Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch???Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:   Presented by Brad HitchMark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:   Presented by Brent Price2000 review/objectives for 20001:Eastern Hemisphere:   Clay HarrisAtlantic Basin:   Doug Arnell/Emilio VicensShipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne PerryLegal:   Dan RogersSeveral questions:Mike/Jeff:   would either or both of you be available to participate,at least for an hour or so to get us started?Eric:   can you be there at least for Monday?Jeff:   have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?Brent:   can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including key contractual provisions required)?FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements for this offsite.Rick---",

Many of you have submitted comments that are hopefullyincluded herein.   Attached is the latest draft of the brochure text.   Please review this very carefully and submit your comments to Henry Means/Zdenek Gerych by Tuesday noon.   I have scanned this and have noted at least several typos and some numerical/statistical errors.   AG, please check in particular the DPC/Metgas stuff.Henry/Z, the purpose of this brochure is to communicate that the market is changing and that Enron is leading the transformation of this industry.   However, there is a negative tone in parts of this that is a slap in the face to the major oil companies and the government companies particularly in the Mid east and Far East.   I want to get all negatives out---anything that a supplier could read as an insult will come back to bite us.   The message should be bold but positive, with no implied insults.I look forward to reading the next draft Tuesday eveningRick---",

We should press ADGAS to see if they would commit to a higher volume.   We also need to determine what we believe is the most effective pricing structure for the ADGAS LNG purchase (both in terms of supply to our project in Spain, but also for potential diversions to Europe in 01/02) and for what term.   Based on our discussions on friday, it may be that a crude based purchase price may work the best.   We have discussed both Brent and NYMEX based pricing formulas with ADGAS.   Merritt, Eric, lets add that to the agenda for our monday morning meeting and get some price structuring done.The structure of the ADGAS deal will be based on a U.S. delivery.   We will reserve the right to divert to any other market (except TEPCO).   We will likely have to share, in some way the shipping savings, if we divert to a non-U.S. terminal but I think we can keep any upside made on the indexed portion of the price for ourselves.In addition we will be contacting OMAN LNG to determine their ability to provide quantities to augment the ADGAS supplies, as well as potential shipping options (Exmar?)   Obviously we need to consider shipping requirements for our Atlantic Basin projects (i.e. Elba Island) when thinking about shipping for Spain.   I would also like to look at how Elba could be used as part of a potential take or pay avoidance strategy for the Spain power plant.I will try to keep everyone updated as the pieces come together.Thanks\n"

The panel, which is scheduled to take place at 10:30 a.m. on Friday, November 17, will be the last session of the conference and will last approximately an hour and fifteen minutes.You don't have to do any significant preparation.   All I ask is that you 1.) review an article, 2.) give some thought to your experiences at Enron, and3.) come willing to talk.   Peter Skarzynski, founder and CEO of Strategos, will moderate the panel.   With Gary Hamel as its chairman, Strategos is a leading innovation consulting company. Gary will be presenting at the conference on Thursday.   His presentation will revolve around his latest book, Leading the Revolution.   In it, Gary outlines ten rules for designing a culture that fosters innovation.   We will focus the panel discussion around seven of the ten rules:Set Unreasonable ExpectationsStretch Your Business DefinitionDesign an Open Market for IdeasOffer an Open Market for CapitalOpen up the Market for TalentLower the Risks of ExperimentationMake Like a Cell - Divide and DivideTo familiarize yourself with these rules, I will be sending you a Fortune magazine article (June 12) that provides an overview.   (You'll notice that Enron is used as an example for several of the rules.)   During the course of discussion, you will be asked to talk about your own experiences with innovation within Enron.   In sharing examples of innovation, Peter will ask you to address the following questions:How did you do it?   (Were one or more of the rules applied?)What were the hurdles? Where did you stumble?What, if anything, was surprising?Outside of discussing specific examples of innovation, the discussion might also include conversation around how to maintain a focus on innovation while running the day to day business or how to spot a good idea.You'll notice I referred to this as an interactive panel.   Another element to this panel will be audience participation.   At this year's conference, for the first time   we will be utilizing an electronic audience response system (ARS).   Through the ARS, presenters will be able to pose yes/no, true/false, or multiple choice questions to the audience.   During the course of the panel discussion, Peter will solicit feedback from the audience on certain topics.   The audience will be able to respond to questions immediately by simply pressing a button on an electronic keypad.   Responses will be instantaneously recorded and graphically displayed on the screen.I want your participation in this panel to be as easy and painless as possible.   I will not be scheduling any meetings to discuss this further.   I will merely ask that you forego the scheduled break at 10:15 a.m. on Friday, and come to the front of the meeting room to speak briefly with Peter and to be equipped with a microphone.   If you wish to speak with Peter prior to November 17, he has assured me that he will make himself available to talk with any of you.   I will be happy to arrange a call for you.If you will not be at the conference and therefore not able to participate, please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can consider a replacement for you.   Feel free to contact me with any other additional questions or concerns.   I'm looking forward to working with each of you on this endeavor,Terrie JamesSr. Director, Corporate CommunicationEnron Broadband Services713-853-77727 (phone)713-646-8887 (fax)terrie_james@enron.net\n"

Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and=\r a=20\rslightly\rlower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem=\rber\rHenry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.\r Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=\r=20\rexpect\rthe relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=\r=20\rmarket.\rTurmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=\r5=20\rBcf per day\rof potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return =\rto=20\rthe gas\rmarket should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil=\rd=20\rthrough\rOctober, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20\rtrillion\rcubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20\rgreater, as\rdistillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse=\rlf=20\rin short\rsupply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=\r of\rdemand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=\ror=20\rshutting\rdown production comes easily or cheaply.\r Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=\rs\rjustifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20\rsignificant\rsettling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20\rsustained in the\rmid-$5.000s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=\r=20\rMore\rluck---a great deal more---would be required to restore a measure of calm to=\r=20\rthe gas\rmarket.\r Gas Storage---The Final Push\rOctober storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20\rapproximately 8.5\rBcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=\re=20\r5.5\rBcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=\r=20\rinjections\rof 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=\r=20\rfutures\rprices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=\r=20\rOctober. With\rthe beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20\rslowing of\rinjections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf---more tha=\rn=20\r1000\rBcf below the previous record low for the end of October.\r CERA expects that many storage holders---having begun the winter with record=\r=20\rlow\rinventories---will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=\rer.\rHowever, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20\rheating load\rfrom last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=\rh CERA\restimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=\r=20\ror even\rsubstantially slower (as occurred during 19998 and 1999), will keep=20\rinventories on a\rtrajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=\r=20\rwill\rremain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=\re=20\rpriced\rout of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=\r=20\roil.\rRegional Markets-Winter Rules\r The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =\rof=20\rwinter\rheating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=\rch\rRocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also\reased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20\rbetween\rboth regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=\rhe\rNortheast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =\rthe\rmagnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=\r=20\rof flows\ron Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=\rr=20\r(see\rTable 3).\r CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:\r * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry\rHub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the\rRockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the\rend of October and early November depending on heating load,\rbut in general strong regional demand will keep differentials\rwell below the ($1.000) per MMBtu summer level. CERA\rexpects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub\rduring November.\r * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies\rwill continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting\rflows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should\rfollow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general\rnarrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA\rexpects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu\rfor November.\r * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the\rPermian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should\rcontinue through November, with some slight widening in the\rMid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows\rcommence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.111) per MMBtu\rand ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.\r * Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline\rduring November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago\rcitygate market. However, the demand rebound that would\rresult from normal November weather this year would offset\rmost of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials\rwill average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when\rAlliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector\rPipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA\rexpects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per\rMMBtu.\r * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial\rrebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,\rbut there is little added delivery capacity into that market.\rCERA expects New York to price $0.666 above the Henry Hub\rduring November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.\r Canadian Markets---Supply Growth Still Uncertain\rThe supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20\runcertain. A\rline pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=\r=20\r2000-3000\rmillion cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=\rn=20\rthe\rpipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20\rquantities of\rgas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=\rs=20\rprecisely\rthe volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =\ris=20\ron par\rwith 1999.

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside Wharton/Penn recruiting.   In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.   This program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years.In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't   in its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing.   The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program.   I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.   You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program.\n"

We did this because we have had several discussions with members who have great difficulty with the 4 pm or 4:30 pm meeting time.Since the Board appears to be fairly evenly split between a noon meeting time and a late afternoon meeting time (10 definitely prefer Noon; 10 definitely prefer late afternoon; and 20 have no strong preference), we have decided to try alternating the meetings.Therefore, our next full board meeting, which is currently scheduled for Monday, January 222 at 4 pm, will instead take place Monday, January 222 at NOON (March meeting will take place at 4 pm).Please note this change on your calendar and advise Cheryl Blissitte by email, phone (713.284.8253) or fax (713.284.8275), whether or not you will be attending. This is especially important as we will order sandwiches for this Noon meeting.Thanks.Marti\n"

I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for the summer.   In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.   I am operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.   I will not accept the notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $2000 gift certificates is viewed as good one.   I'm not sure that is a good use of Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for the sell weekends.Jeff\n"

Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add even more value as we explore your basis risks.   I've asked Mark Tawney, Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities.   His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge research.   We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate relationship.   If there is anything else I can do, please call. It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier.   Again thanks for your time.Regards,\n"

We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer interaction, immediate scalability, and more portfolio diversification.   I would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that portion of the operation, and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia.

Currently I am a second year analyst faced with the dilemma of which career path to pursue.   Although there are several options, I'm primarily interested in developing a deeper understanding of Enron's market philosophy. Trading, risk management, and commodity structuring all sound interesting to me at this point, but I want to go into my next rotation with a clear sense of direction.Brad Hitch, who I worked with over at Enron International, suggested I contact you to discuss your needs as well as new developments in your group.   He thought you would be in an excellent position to assist me with my decision.My resume' is attached for your consideration. As you will see, I have a significant amount of Investment Banking, and financial industry experience. I know how busy you must be during this time of year, but I would appreciate a few minutes of your time.I shall call you during the week of November 14th to schedule a time for us to meet. In the meantime, if you need to contact me, my number is 713-853-6818. Please leave a message if I'm not in, and I'll return your call the next day.I look forward to   speaking with you.Sincerely,Damon Harvey\n"

In this role, he will work with all commodity products, assets,   and teams and lever our existing businesses with new this new focus.   (Do you want to put in his background---which you probably now more than I?)   He will be reporting to the Office of the Chairman.Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick Bergsieker.   We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.   (Do you want to put in his background?)   Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket relationships and   industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.   Eric and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.   Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet pages exist today.   Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination group.   Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial interface for our intranet page.   Heather was with Azurix, where she worked on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives. Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.   This group will be comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management businesses.   This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics important to their individual markets, and discuss other   markets in a macro sense.   We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.   In this group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a bias toward structural shifts in markets.   This group will not be involved in customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. (anything else?)\n"

I also remember that John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.   In fact he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not allow it, so he was using 0.999.We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.

Attached is the resume of a personal friend of mine, Robert Brown (Bobby), who may be a good fit for your group.   He is a '97 University of Pennsylvania graduate (3.1 GPA) with a degree in Economics and an International Finance concentration.   Additionally, he holds Series 7, 63, 65 licenses.   Bobby had expressed an interest in Enron to me some time ago, but didn't want to pursue anything at the time as he was going to be traveling for quite a while.   He contacted me last week, ready to explore opportunities at Enron.   Upon reading his resume, I felt it is very much in line with many of the other resumes I'd surfaced for you and Lavorato to you last month (given to you by Ted Bland).   He's very bright, ambitious and I feel would fit very well into the Enron environment.Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions!Amyx58034&lt;&lt; - Resume.doc\n"

The graph attached gives the raw data and theword doc some risk/ reward analysis (19995 was a weird year).(See attached file: Brent_TI Analysis.xls)(See attached file:Brent_WTI-Trade.doc)The spread is pretty constant at 1.25- 1.40 up until the contracts areprompt- then the average is more like 1.80.   2000 was particularly strikingbecause of the gasoline shortage in the Mid West which put pressure on WTIat Cushing (and in general kept cracks high)- we got out to 2.70.   We arelooking for a repeat this year.   The Arb has generally moved to 2.70minimum (to bring Brent to Cushing) because of higher freight rates thisyear- this looks to continue.The spread has moved out the last few days as Dec Brent is getting tight(due to UK tax affect)- now 1.52 at 1.57Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.Rgds,CA\n"

The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up the current situation.   Bottom   line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India from 1000% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.   I don't know how much someone may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling this terminalWe will discuss next week when we are in India.   Please advise if youhave any thoughts or suggestionsRick---",
        " Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 09/30/2000 111:59 AM --- \tenron india \tFrom:   Wade Cline   09/30/2000 04:25 AM To: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, A G Gelotti/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Clay Harris/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company   Rick, we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week. Metgas is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here. Today, Metgas is 1000% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG role, we should discuss ASAP.AG --- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with Rick and Clay.WadeRick Bergsieker09/30/2000 01:45 AMTo: Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Clay Harris/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company   Clay:   I suggest taht you meet with David Forbes asap.Bill/Wade:   I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.

For fuel supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.   They will have BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way the the various voting procedures are designed.   I am not as familiar with the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to negotiated something there since it is still in development.   Also, there should be attractive commercial returns with each project.I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.   If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly.Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.Bill \tenron india \tFrom:   Wade Cline   09/28/2000 12:21 PM To: Clay Harris/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company   Bill, please get back with Clay on this and let him know if you think there is a fit.

Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or better than the machine the customer has currently, then swap that hardware.   The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 2000.   Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock, here is what I propose:Every machine we migrate is Ghosted.   By this, I mean we run a program called Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state.   This image can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other data.   I propose we Ghost your existing machine, make a backup copy of that image (after verifying it works correctly), then re-use your current hardware with Windows 2000.   The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT (your current system) as quickly if something does not work.   If you would like to move ahead with this plan, please let me know.   Otherwise, we will order a machine with the same specifications, but it will take some time to get here.I look forward to hearing from you.Regards,-Mike HernandezProject GEM(713)853-77740\n"

The 1 million Var applies to the line next to Ross's name on the p&amp;l sheets.   I don't know how many people trade that book, but I assume it is only ross.   If ross get's bulled up at every sign of snow in london, all the more reason to get a weather guy hired asap.   Small positions, and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat around.

I had asked the traders two weeks ago to clean-up the book as much as possible as we approached year end so that we could break-up the book easily in early january.   unfortunately, they havenot done this and I had instructed all of the london distillate traders (koller,o'brien,talvitie) today that if they wanted any positions they were to let me know by the cob today because I would be liquidating the book this week.   the only thing I insisted they take is the otc diff swaps that are traded for the physical bbls they are all assigned to trade.   in the case of ross these are large positions but the back office is making those changestonight and we can see what the var of those positions is tomorrow.   the 1 million var limit for london distillates wewill need to calculate by the sum of their 3 positions.   in regards to the book presently under ross I will get that down to 1 mil var but ask that you give me weds and thurs to get this done.   I will try to get this all doneby tomorrow and had been reducing the positions today.   I would like to get a var for the global distillatebook and will assume for now that the 1 mil will be for the 3 london traders.   I will assume ownershipof all of those positions in the koller distillate book from now on so that these these guys, and ross specifically, can clear their heads and start over with as close as possible to a clean sheet of paper.   I made if very clearto them that starting over was a question of rebuilding credability and they should take great efforts to ensurethat any positions they liked was put on at a low risk entry point and with small volumes.   to get some of the losses clawed back from friday though I would like to make you aware that this book has about a 3.5 million dollar climb to just get back to breakeven for 20001.   lastly, I will also take over all of the positions in the london/singapore and us/uk arb books.   I would like this book to be renamed - mahoney physical.   the kollerdistillate book will be renamed mahoney financial.   \tFrom:   Jeffrey A Shankman   02/01/20001 20:52 To: John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Mahoney/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Scott Earnest/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bjorn Hagelmann/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Starting tomorrow, Jan 3, the London Distillates book run by Ross Koller will have a max var position of   $1 million.

New Range Rover - I want to relay that I am privately informed Ford wish to acceleratethe U.S launch of the new car. The UK launch is Sept. this year so reasonably may mean arrival here early 20002. Believing this to be accurate, this may relieve you of making any decision on Range Rover right now.Given your continuous search for \"good people\" and assuming your firm remains on the look-out for such people, I wish your permission to submit a resume of a colleague.This lady has excellent work-ethics, is an outstanding achiever with high energy and I believe, the suited attributes for the culture within Enron. I would hope this could be reviewed and sent onward to the relevant people who would invite her for an initial meeting in the near future. Please advise this is okay.AlanAlan D. Lucks\n"

I am asking that you forward this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).   We will conduct first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the afternoon.   We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning (9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.   Please submit your response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.

Obviously, I don't know quite what structure you want to put in place, and perhaps there are some projects I'm not aware of, but from what I've seen I would be worried that this guy would get bored. Just a thought, but looking at this guy's resume he'd be an ideal guy to work with Jonathan Whitehead and Joe Hirl in Tokyo.   He speaks fluent Japanese, knows the Japanese market, has contacts at Mitsubishi, and knows the LNG world.   Quite frankly, he might do more good for Enron's LNG effort working for Enron Japan than for LNG.Also, regarding Elba Island, do you think you'd be ready for a conference call on Monday?Thanks,Brad\n"

Another possible sore point is the interest ratescharged by the banks for coffee retention. So far there has been noindication that favorable interest rates will be extended to AEKI. Some areconcerned that the rate will be higher than that charged by the privatebanks. Due to the tension which exists on these issues, AEKI has threatenedthe government that if the money is not chanelled before April they willrelease 10,5000 tons of coffee in their retained stock from the warehouses inLampung and Medan.There are people who believe that 10,5000 tons is \"just the tip of theiceberg.\" There is more than 7,5000 tons in stock in Lampung alone, accordingto an important domestic farmer in Lampung,   who is close to our source. Infact the farmer estimates that Lampung itself has more than 10,000 tons andthere are another 4,000 to 5,000 tons in Medan.VIETNAM COFFEE- STRONG BEARISH- VIETNAMESE DUMPING \"PHANTOM STOCKS\" IN NEIGHBORING MARKETSOur primary source comments that in his opinion, it may be true that thereare additional stocks over the 150,000 tons as reported. Cambodia has beenused as a dumping ground for Vietnam's extra quota sales.Upon investigation, our source learned that it is true that there are someexcess stocks stored in Vietnam. He was informed by a source that theVietnamese plan to release the stocks into Cambodia and also China to spongeup the excess supplies. They command a fixed price in the black markets ofthose countries and provide much needed foreign exchange to the Vietnamgovernment. The secondary source said that this is common practice forVietnam and they have done this for other cash commodities like Cashewnuts.The source does not know the exact figures, but estimates the excess to be30,000 to 40,000 tons more than what has been acknowledged by thegovernment.\n"

I just thought I'd tell you my thoughts of the Houston people - I worked with most for 4 years.   I know you probably know most of them.Nigel Patterson- basically trained me - he is the NYMEX trader- worked for BT almost 13 years in London, NY, and Houston .   Andy Zipper trained him.   He's a good trader - traded currencies, commods (metals, energy).   He could trade any of our products- would be especially good at new businesses.   He has been in Houston for 4 years and is originally from New Zealand- has a wife and 2 girls.   Vice President.Calvin Schlenker- ran Calgary office for 2 years before we shut it in 19997- he then took on head of marketing role in Houston - his successes have been with producers - being able to exploit lending and hedging.   Most recently, he's been trading the nat gas options book.   Very smart guy with good ideas- analytical and conceptual- he'd be VERY good with Per's syndication efforts or credit derivative initiative.   Knows gas and crude.   He is Canadian- ex-wife and 2 kids.   Director.Steve Provenzano - basis trader - very good contacts in the industry.   Worked for MG before BT. He did a lot of marketing with me.   Because he's done both trading and marketing, he's got a good edge with customers.   Only has gas experience.   He is likely to go to New York but recently got married and has a kid on the way.   Director.Also, Deutsche's two head oil traders in London just quit- but I am not sure what they are doing yet- will find out.   That is Janelle Matharoo and Jason Thiel (MD and Director)- both been with BT almost 15 years- very good traders- always in London.   Jason used to be BT's head gold trader: Janelle has also traded metals.Looks like Deutsche is crumbling on energy- I know they have added a few crude traders in NY to service their hedge fund clients (our prospective clients) but they have not been able to pull everything together- they are loosing all the key people in the business.I'd like to help in the process of pulling some of these people in if we have the desire.Kind Regards,Caroline\n"

The Brazilian=20\rgovernment is likely to release its 20001-20002 forecast in December or Janua=\rry=20\r20001.   The 1999 plantings garnered expectations of a 20001-20002 crop yield o=\rf=20\r444-46 million bags.   However, recent weather problems have caused a=20\rsignificant downgrade of this forecast to between 333 and 40 million bags.\r Other sources in contact with coffee growers in Brazil report the potential=\r=20\rfor even greater damage to the 20001-20002 crop, in the range of up to a 50=\r=20\rpercent drop, or 222-23 million bags.   Agronomists from Cooxupe, the largest=\r=20\rcoffee cooperative in Brazil, have already pegged their first estimate at=\r=20\r27.8 million bags.

A shortage of significant rainfall between now and the=\r=20\rend of December could bring yield down to a 30 percent loss from the=20\rforecast, in the range of 333-36 million bags.\r Rain is particularly significant because the new planting in recent years h=\ras=20\rbeen concentrated in the Cerrado (savannah) region of Northern Brazil.

One problem on that front is still how much producers want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and his aides   want to pay around $50 to $555 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best way to   determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term contracts.Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.   This week's legislative activitiesin Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to finance power purchases after utility bankruptcy.1. Audit- Untangling Utility RelationshipsCalifornia officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that half of the $9 to $12 billion   the utilities say they owe is actually owed to themselves for power they bought from their corporate relationsThis strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices was bought from themselves.   But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part of any potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to use state credit to eliminate the \"risky debt\" premium that PG&amp;E and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In return he is demanding that the companies prepare to \"share the burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension.\"2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared upduring a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis' idea, ashe laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize the debts and sell them against the utilities' forward rate base or by establishing amedium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees.   In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins topaydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the $50-$555 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can paydown this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remainsopposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much flexibility.3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation   Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political   advisers have with \"non-market\" solutions to the energy crisis. Although the Governor's aides actually believe the weapon is more a \"way to force eventual   agreement, than an actual solution,\" the talk returns frequently to these non-market mechanisms. \"We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by the   Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and we will re-take   the plants and equipment and run them ourselves,\" a close political aide to Davis said. \"We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the reserved parking   places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second.\"\n"

I think he would be very helpful in developing models and structures.ThanksJenDear Ms. Fraser,I am writing after having heard from a contact at Enron that you are seeking a number of people to fill various vacancies at your Houston office.   If this is the case I would very much like to be considered for one of these vacancies.As you will notice from the attached Curriculum Vitae I am currently employed as an Energy Markets Consultant at Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh, the energy consultancy arm of Deutsche Bank.   My prior work experience includes two years as a Gas Markets Analyst for a Management Consultancy firm in London, time as an Energy Journalist covering the European gas and electricity markets and a year long spell as an academic Research Assistant.Prior to these positions I read for an MSc in Energy Studies at the Centre for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy at the University of Dundee, Scotland.   Whilst reading for the MSc I elected to specialise in oil and gas industry economics and law.Before undertaking the MSc I read for a B.A. (Hons) Business Administration degree.   This allowed me to build, develop and hone to a high standard the essential skills of financial, strategic, business and economic analysis.   Having majored in Management Accountancy I am well versed in undertaking analysis tasks of this type at both a micro and macro level, from both a qualitative and quantitative approach.Given the opportunity, I feel confident I could make an immediately tangible contribution to the work of Enron.   I have attached my CV in Word 97 format.   If this is incompatible with your systems please do not hesitate to contact me and I will send it in a different format.I apologise in advance for this unsolicited approach.

I spent a great part of my professional career in the oil &amp; gas business.   Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can bring value to his team.   I have not gotten any response yet.As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for Enron:   Cement.   This industry can be transformed to the new economy and given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline.This is new for me but enormously challenging.   I am asking you to give me a chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.   I have enclosed a brief resume for your review.I look forward to meeting with you.   Thanks, Jeffken\n"

Florida markets.Our development efforts to date have not been as focussed on T.B. as they have been on the Bahamas proposal.   However, we came across a potential site in the Tampa Bay port which meets many of our criteria for a terminal site   (e.g. existing deep water port, sufficient acreage adjacent to the port, industrial zoning).   We have yet to test the rationale of injecting significant quantities of gas into that market location, but the port is willing to commit to exclusivity on their part until the end of the year.   In this period of time we can easily determine if the project makes sense.I believe its a good defense against others making a similar move and we are committing to nothing and paying no dollars.Please let me know if you concur.   The draft letter is attached below (I've got legal sign-off on it already).Thanks ---"

He said that this has also been transmitted to Mike McConnell in writing. His reason was that he had bent over backwards to make the proposal originally and the LNG group has been slow to respond. I reminded him that we were delayed in getting back because of some legal issues but now that we were all part of EGM that this was no longer an issue. He went on to say that he will not turn over any of the fees until phase 2 kicks in, some time next year (Marc de La Roche said something to me the other day about Jan.01). That the LNG group will have to bear all expenses until that time just like EFI had to for liquid fuels. He did say that in their case India did reimburse them on their previous expenses as a reduction/credit to the fee. He also went on to say that he was not happy with India's attempt to get a piece of EFI's fee.Please advise how you would like me to proceed.TP\n"

We've always maintained that access to the Metgas terminal and storage and pipeline is key to any plans Enron has in the LNG business. Personally, I have always thought Enron should just finance and build the pipeline itself and then sell it once it becomes operational, maintaining access to the terminal and pipeline capacity. Glad to see you're on board, because we can use the help. But this is going to require some Enron commitment. To meet Enron's objectives (no debt consolidation, cash flow and earnings), the current selldowns being considered are to industry and related players who want their share of the upsides of the business. So giving Enron any preferred rights is going to be tough with these players.Let's discuss next week in India. I have requested the Metgas meetings with the EGM LNG team be on Wednesday.Clay Harris09/29/2000 03:41 AMTo: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jeffrey A Shankman@ECT, V V Rao/SIN/ECT@ECT Subject: DPC/Metgas Equity SaleOne of the keys to growing the LNG business is access to LNG terminals and fuel supply opportunities. We should insure that the sell down of DPC and Metgas be structured such that Enron/EGM retain terminal rights and fuel supply rights at Dabhol, if appropriate. The Metgas terminal/regas rights under the TARA and EFI's fuel management/fuel supply rights under the Fuel Management Agreement need to stay with Enron/EGM. Lets discuss next week in Mumbai.Clay\n"

He could also report to us obviously (like Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a   lot of sense.   What do you think?If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.   I thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker.

First, there is no direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations and current discussions with the suppliers.From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I   met with both suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural start date under   both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 111, 20002 for Oman and April 30, 20002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will   be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone number is 505/3336-84000.Clay\n"

In other words, Don would need to appoint his own people - an IT person to build the site (which we can assist with) and someone to research all their publications to see whether they're available electronically.   The EES Marcom group sent me 333 publications which they subscribe to and before I call Don to tell him he needs an EES person to take care of these, I want to make sure you and I have the same understanding.   We briefly talked about this before, but I want to be certain.   Thanks.\n"

It is my goal to use these seminars as a learning and information exchange tool. The weekly topics range from instructional (basics of swaps and futures) to team-building exercises.   With this in mind, I was hoping that each of you could commit to a Wednesday seminar for 1 hour to review your careers at Enron and discuss what you did to become successful. The seminars are open to all analysts / associates in EGM/ ENA trading. I intend to ask each   EGM   business head to participate as well. I am hoping that your seminars will work as an informal mentoring exercise as providing guidance to our new people on how to have a successful career.The seminars usually begin at 4 p.m. I hope each of you will participate. Please let me know your availability. There is no need to bring a presentation, as the meetings are very informal.ThanksJen\n"

This business we are doing is also better than the NYMEX look-a-like business in that we are developing a mix of counterparties who are paying the bid/offer. Today's counterparties included Valero, Hess, Cargill and Bank of America. Next week we will launch our NYMEX heat and gas crack products.

MTBE front month swap, U S Gulf fixed price.3. Cal 02 UNL gasoline crack spread (this one probably requires VAR increase)4. WTI swaps that match the timing of our gasoline and HO cracks. This gives customers the option to convert crack spread positions to fixed price gasoline and HO swaps through EOL.Regarding long dated gasoline positions we are long 75 kb per month cal 02 gulf coast gas cracks which probably won't move much in value until march/April 01. I view this position as very low risk and good profit potential but this position does tie up VAR. If marketing can sell at $3.80 or better happy to get out of this for now. This is the only long dated position in my book.\n"

For the future we need something more to combat ICE and other systems. Getting the brokers on our side could be the answer. The benefits I can see are:a. We will reach a wider crowd using the brokers. Today there are companies who will not turn on our system despite personal visits and other marketing. They seem to prefer speaking to brokers.b. We could gain neutrality if the broker could transact on EOL on behalf of the customer. The biggest problem when I speak to customers seems to be that by dealing with Enron on EOL the customer is afraid of giving us to much of information of what they are doing.c. The brokers are scared for the future. They think they are about to die out due to electronic trading. Enron should be able to strike a good deal with the broker. Maybe even get paid ?d. Enron would gain a free marketing force thru the brokers.regardschris glaas   To: Chris Glaas/LON/ECT@ECTcc: John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andy Zipper/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: EOL and the brokers   Get with Nowlan and talk to Andy Zipper on this.

With respect to Iraq, the US has dropped its opposition to allowing Baghdad to receive its oil revenues from the UN oil-for-food program in euros rather than dollars.   This means that the estimated 10 billion $US in Iraq's BNP account could be converted to euros in the next 30 days, perhaps all at once.

I had a meeting with the minister and the deputy minister for technical affairs and both were intereseted in increased participation in the LNG field in Egypt.   They are interested in diverse off-takers, and are interested in investing in new facilities (EGPC would like to own 60% of such a new facility and local/Arab investors can be found for the remaining equity).   They know they don't know how to project finance such deals, and they know they need a strong international name as an (at least partial) off-take.   They alluded that the situation with Finosa, although progressing, is not as it appears in the press.At any case, I believe we have enough elements to warrant a conversations---and I have good contacts in Egypt that could help push such a project forward.Cheers'HamdAlhamd AlkhayatENRON CORP.+1(713)853-0315This message (including any attachments) contains confidential information intended for a specific individual and purpose, and is protected by law.

I would think getting the small specs on our system would give us much greater daily deal flow.   On the oilside, our main counterparties are the large speculative trading shops and this reflects that it is mainly proprietary traders that weare attracting at this stage.   Not sure how realistic this is from a credit perspective but if we could create some type of margin accountfor the smaller players, similiar to the futures exchange clearing houses,   we might be able to significantly increase our volumes with the existing instruments that we are presently offering.   \tFrom:   Jeffrey A Shankman   24/10/2000 222:31 To: John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, George McClellan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Tawney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Mahoney/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: EnronOnline Executive Summary for October 23, 2000FYI.

The draft reflects that we would pay $250,000 for each of the next 4 years, commencing in December 2000.   My understanding is that Jeff Shankman and Jeff Skilling have approved of this gift.Before we finalize this arrangement, are you aware of any issues/matters/provisions that Enron typically attempts to deal with in these types of gifting arrangements? I just want to make sure that we don't overlook anything material. If you would like to see a copy of the draft Agreement, I can have it delivered to you.Your prompt reply is appreciated.Thanks.Best Regards, Alan\n"

With this in mind, the CACS form has had further minor changes made to it and is to be found at: S:\\legal\\CACS form. Please ensure you use the form at this location at all times henceforth. Do not save it into your own directories, as further changes will be put through on this form only in future. No changes are to be made to this form please (in particular to the named signatories) without my agreement.Please read the notes on the second page of the CACS form and then adhere to the process set out there. This is particularly important because many of the commercial teams are not reading these and then appear to be getting differing explanations of the process from us. Some of the support units in particular are unhappy that A1 is not being complied with, leaving them with inadequate time to review contracts. I am always happy to improve the form, especially if it simplifies, so suggestions are welcome.Two things which will happen are: - adapted forms of the CACS will be produced for EES, Enron Global Markets and (until divested) Enron Wind. In the meantime if lawyers working on transactions within those divisions believe the proforma CACS needs to be changed to accomodate the needs of those divisions, please let me know. Mary Nell: I believe that EBS already has its own independent contract sign off process. Let me know if that is not correct.- the CACS system will be automated - probably on the workflow system as per the new billing system. The idea is that at the earliest opportunity in the life of a contract, the CACS relating to that contract is put on the system which automatically alerts signatories that they should be looking out for drafts. Draft contracts will be able to be circulated through the system. The signing process will also be simplified.Thanks for your attention.   Mark\n"

In Enron Europe we use what is known as a CACS form for approval of non-standard deals. I attach a copy of the current form together with an email from Mark Evans, General Counsel for Enron Europe. I wonder whether for EGM business you wd want to modify the CACS form; for example, under the standard European CACS if the deal involves a commitment of   GBP 3 million or more, either Michael Brown or John Sherriff needs to sign. It may be more appropriate for EGM deals for either of you to sign (unless you are happy to allow the European Office of the Chairman to sign) with a different (possibly USD denominated) threshold.I would be grateful for your thoughtsRobert ---"

They are from Beth Evans at Platt's and Robert Givens at Bridge News.   They have both spoken with Renard Euell and asked for our side of the story.   Primary points made are as follows:9/28 or 29 - Mr. Euell contacted Enron through an employee in another division of Enron   - This contact was forwarded to John Nowlan through a second employee9/29   - Nowlan contacted Mr. Euell and told him that if Euell receives part of the oil that Enron would talk to him about a possible deal   - Euell said he felt he would win part (NOTE: This was said in response to Beth's comment that Euell claimed Enron contacted him with   apparent inside knowledge that Euell was going to win part of the bid.)10/3 or 4 - Euell called us regarding the SPR oil he won   - We asked for the particulars of his bid and he stated them to us10/4   - Enron received from Euell a copy of his letter to the DOE   - The details were different than Euell had told us, but conversations continued10/5   - Enron faxed a draft Novation Agreement to Euell.   This was never executed.   In fact, it has never left draft form.10/5 thru 9 - Various conversations with Euell   - He claimed to be in conversations with Nigeria, Shell, Mobil, BP, Equilon, Koch and Phillips10/10   - Enron spoke with Euell around noon and suggested he take another deal that Euell claimed to have   - Euell called Enron around 4:30 pm...Enron reiterated belief that Euell should take the bid he claimed to have   - Interestingly, Euell was in Houston supposedly having meetings with various companies, but never requested a meeting with Enron, nor   did he ever have a meeting with EnronBoth reporters, prior to their conversation with me, are convinced the guy is a flake.   And lay most of the blame for the SPR debacle on the back of the DOE.   Palmer plans to contact John Fialka at Wall Street Journal later today.   If you have any questions, call me at ext. 3-9053.Eric\n"

Policy on Noncompetition.   I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2.Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).   Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.   The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a \"dumping ground\" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.   As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates.   The following is a summary of these competition provisions:Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.   If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.   Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&amp;M, offtaker or risk management services.There are a number of exceptions to this rule:   (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; &amp;copy; projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction.\"Affiliates\" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).\"Asia Pacific Region\" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 20003.Thank you,Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI\n"

This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.   It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do).   It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.

Policy on Noncompetition.   I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2.Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).   Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.   The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a \"dumping ground\" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.   As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates.   The following is a summary of these competition provisions:Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.   If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.   Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&amp;M, offtaker or risk management services.There are a number of exceptions to this rule:   (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; &amp;copy; projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction.\"Affiliates\" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).\"Asia Pacific Region\" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 20003.Thank you,Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI\n"

My thoughts are that the deals Ozzie are talking about it are great and could very well be a part of what we do with the LNG deal, but I doubt the meeting will get to that level of detail.   If we get the LNG deal and a possible gas transaction on to FPL's radar screen, then we will have accomplished alot.   Having Ozzie there as Enron's Florida power project developer may be too distracting.   As part of the many follow-up   meetings we will hope to have with FPL, Ozzie can make his pitch to them.If you concur, I'll let Ozzie know.Thanks\n"

The analysts and Associates for our group were assessed with the Traders for the first time.The process was that a piece of paper was handed out showing the number of analysts and associates for each different class i.e trading, origination, finance, tech support etc and the forced distribution of rankings that would be followed for each group (I will get a copy of the sheet and fax it to you). We were told to rank all the Analysts (then after the Associates) from top to bottom and these were fitted to the distribution according to the sheet we were given with no deviation from the distribution shown on the sheet. We were told the names of the categories meant nothing and were just groupings ie \"Has Issues\" did not mean this it just meant the bottom two or three people of the distribution.The electricity desks had already had pre-meetings in which they fitted their own people and they expected every other group to fit their people similiarly.The three A&amp;A people we have here in London were all allocated \"Excellent\" ratings prior to the meeting but due to forced ranking of people to the defined distribution two of these were moved down to \"Strong\".I am sorry that I did not send this email on Monday.Regards,Shane   \n"

Panamaxes have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.   Most bundits think that this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.   The Japanese buyers and the US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news of resumed shipping.   When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market quickly reversed trend and starting going up.   With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.

Thank you for your help and advice with regards to my new rotation. I am enjoying the new work immensely and have the opportunity to review all sort of new technologies and business plans. We recently   came up with the idea of creating a separate program aimed at the big energy companies in Houston whereby the generation of new ideas and technologies aimed at the energy industry could be outsourced to the Houston Technology Center and therefore benefit from a level of freedom and flexibility that is difficult to achieve within the hierarchical structures of most big energy players in town. These \"idea labs\" would be set up as separate companies and would only require funding from investors such as Shell, Exxon Mobil, and the likes. I assume that Enron would not be particularly interested   given its own internal entrepreneurial spirit although it could benefit from the exposure to such new   ventures and potentially find candidates with technologies it might want   to invest in. This idea was just recently floated and no real steps have been taken in any direction which is why I am wondering if I can ask you for your opinion. Please let me know of any questions you might have and have a wonderful holiday.Again thank you and my best wishes for the New YearMassimo\n"

We discussed this last week and I thought the consensus was to slow this process down and exclude partners who could impede our strategic global LNG interests --- for example Petronas and BP Amoco.   I now understand that we are making presentatations on the equity sale to potential investors next week in Singapore (BP, Petronas, CEPA, Mitsubishi, etc).   I don't like the notion that we must disclose our TIGA to SPA to potential investors.   There are several aspects of that SPA which gives us strategic advantage over other competitors - for example the diversion clause of 0.5 MMTA.   I like even less the thought that one of our partners will see the Master Supply Agreement (MSA) to MetGas.   Once a competitor sees the MSA they will have some insight on how to undermine our supply aggregation efforts and how Enron manages its Global LNG risk book.   This is a serious concern and we must ensure that it doesn't happen --- first by exclusion and then by negotiation (i.e. in the shareholders agreement we don't give investors with less than 10% equity the right to see contracts --- by the way Petronas does this routinely with its partners in MLNG TIGA).Your thoughts???vvr\n"

I don't think it would be a good fit for us at all right now.While emissions traders in EGM are looking at the Kyoto process and the potential for global carbon trading, we are still a long way from there being any viable trading market whatsoever.   EES is interested in following the JI and CDM issues for potential opportunities related to energy efficiency.   Our role has been to participate in the process and monitor the development of these issues and see if there are effects on our markets or opportunities.   I may have someone attend or may see if someone in Mark Schroeder's group in London can attend, but I would not recommend our speaking at this time.

On my first day at my desk, she called and asked me tocome to her office and she introduced me to Cathy Phillips and YolandaMartinez.   The reason for this e-mail is that I have encountered someemployee problems at my location and have confided in Jennifer.   Herprofessionalism, eloquence and intelligence belies her youth.

IN summary:- The Prime mInister and Oil Minister are open to discuss this project,in the context of clear future needs, estimated at 4000 BCF by 20005. As amatter of fact, the Oil Minister - Wa'el Sabri - brought in his seniorteam to the meeting and scheduled a working session with Enron forSeptember 27, at 10:000 AM- In addition, the Royal Court (Diwan) support this development and hassent to the meetings Dr. Bassem Awadallah, the Economic Advisor to KingAbdullah- The Amoco deal is dead: they had an axclusivity arrangement whichended recently and they had in mind a pricing scheme linked to the \"fuelbeing used currently\" or to oil prices, both of which were totallyunacceptable to JOrdan- Whatever deal there is will need to compete against the odds that thedeal with Irak, which provides Jordan with virtually \"free\" oil, willkeep as it is. In fact, it is this deal which has allowed the Governmentto procrastinate on the AMOCO discussions- Jordan is comfortable that there is gas in Risha, close to the Irakborder. Schlumberger are currently exploring in that region. The thingis that the government is convinced that whatever gas they may find inRisha should not prevent them fromstriking a deal for an import scheme- The government has been approached by the Saleh Kamel group of saudiarabia, which believes thay may be able to set up a new company whichwill develop gas fields in the northwestern part of saudi (Tabouk) andexport it to Jordan. This is still at a very preliminary stage, butappears to be of great interest to the jordanians- IN addition, British Gas approached the minister with a new scheme,relying on gas discovered \"off the coast of Gaza and Israel, which willrequire a shorter pipeline. the thing is that the Jordanians feeluncomfortable with imports through Israel at this stage of the \"peaceprocess\"!So here we are, welcome to pitch into this situation. I used theargument of speed of development and this is something we need to checkwith the Egyptians.The course of action is as follows:1. ENRON is to issue a letter to the Jordan Energy Minister (ASAP)stating the opportunity and formally requesting discussions. NoMIDDLEMAN PLEASE...THIS WAS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PM and the Minister!.The address is:H.E. Eng. WA'EL SABRIMinister of Energy &amp; Mineral ResourcesP.O.Box 1400027, Amman, JordanFax No. 9626 586 5373Phone No. 9626 581 13338A fax will do, as far as the minister is concerned.2. A meeting has been scheduled on september 27, at 10:000 AM in theMinister's office. it is likely to be attended by Ahmad Bashir,secretary General of the Ministry and Rashad Aburas, Advisor to theMinister (National Electric Power Co.), plus some other people3. Based on the demand projections and timing, the jordanians expectsome kind of a formal proposal. time of important, as other competingschemes may have political or technical delaysFellows, the Jordanians are supportive of the scheme and its sponsors,so we need to capitalize on this.In line with my phone discussions with Rob, I will try to rearrange themeeting for monday sept. 25 and, if possible, our meeting in Cairo forsunday sept. 24.I will keep you posted. Any thoughts on the competing schemes are mostwelcome.Charles\n"

The bottom line is the Japanese are itching for another joint interventi=\ron.\rThe weak euro is hurting Japanese export sales in the euro zone and beyond\rand they would like to draw a line in the sand near 85 euros to the dollar\rand 92 yen to the euro. Problem is, the United States =01) in the person of\rLarry Summers =01) wants intervention used only as a tool of last resort, a=\rnd\ronly when central banks can use the element of surprise to spook market\rplayers into euro buying and maximize the bang for their buck.\r 3. Will the Bank of Japan participate in another round of massive euro buyi=\rng?\rYes, but only when the U.S. participates in full measure. At what level wil=\rl\rthat multilateral intervention next occur? Very difficult to say. If the\rJapanese and some in Europe had their druthers they would have been in ther=\re\rthis week. Most analysts say the market has drawn a line in the sand at 80\reuros to the dollar and if the central banks let the euro sink below that\rlevel they=01,ll have a devil of a time getting it back up.\r Our judgement is that they have to act above 80. To try to narrow our\rprediction beyond that would, I think, be foolhardy.\r 4. As to yen-dollar, we see some further yen weakness ahead for several=20\rreasons.\rThe wave of bankruptcies   in Japan shows no sign of abating. And they=01,re\rgetting bigger, with Kyoei Life=01,s demise the largest yet (4.5 trillion y=\ren).\rWhile big bankruptcies are inevitable and some see a silver lining because\rJapan is finally trimming the dead wood from its economy, the effect on\rmarket sentiment has been grim. The Nikkei remains lost in a dark, dark woo=\rd\rfor that reason, and in sympathy with the NASDAQ.\r Oil prices and the events in the middle east are also dollar positive on\rbalance, because of the flight to quality and the fact that much of the\rworld=01,s oil is denominated in dollars. And the Japanese first half repor=\rting\rseason ended Sept. 30, taking away a big incentive for exporters to\rrepatriate dollars.\r So we see a somewhat weaker range for the yen over the near term =01) let=\r=01,s\rcall it 108-1112, with a bias towards the bottom of that range. There=01,s s=\rome\rheavy resistance to the dollar   around 111.73, this year=01,s peak. So whil=\re the\rdollar might poke through 1110 some time soon, the bulk of trading should be\rin the 108-109 range.\r Longer term, rising profits on the export and high-tech sectors and continu=\red\rstrong capital investment will pull the economy slowly out of the woods. An=\rd\rwe continue to look for a stronger yen next year.\r 5. On BOJ policy, don=01,t look for another rate increase any time soon.

First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table---(including Pierre and Wayne).   Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities.   Third, execute.   I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward.Thanks.

Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or better than the machine the customer has currently, then swap that hardware.   The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 2000.   Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock, here is what I propose:Every machine we migrate is Ghosted.   By this, I mean we run a program called Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state.   This image can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other data.   I propose we Ghost your existing machine, make a backup copy of that image (after verifying it works correctly), then re-use your current hardware with Windows 2000.   The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT (your current system) as quickly if something does not work.   If you would like to move ahead with this plan, please let me know.   Otherwise, we will order a machine with the same specifications, but it will take some time to get here.I look forward to hearing from you.Regards,-Mike HernandezProject GEM(713)853-77740\n"

I have outlined the facts as I know them in regards to our position with PG&amp;E.Enron Energy Marketing Corporation (\"EEMC\") has four outstanding purchases from PG&amp;E Energy Trading - Power LP (\"PG&amp;E\").   One of these transactions PG&amp;E has backed with a purchase from MS.   We have not been disclosed exact terms of the transaction PG&amp;E has with MS.   The terms of our transaction with PG&amp;E are as follows:EEMC purchases 1000MW around the clock 1/1/20001 to 12/31/20002 from PG&amp;E with delivery point of SP15 at price of $29/MwhThis transaction is currently in-the-money $130mm.We are proposing to assign EEMC's position to EPMI and then EPMI would agree to take assignment from PG&amp;E its position with MS in return for unwinding EPMI's transaction with PG&amp;E.   Our net book value would remain unchanged but we would transfer credit exposure to MS rather than PG&amp;E.It is my understanding that MS is currently posting margin to PG&amp;E above some threshold within the Master contract between PG&amp;E and MS.   With the assignment EPMI would assume the contract under its Master agreement.   The current agreement has no executed margining agreements but we have been exchanging margin above a $15mm bilateral threshold.   Enron would be willing to either not require collateral on the deal or take the collateral under the current terms negotiated but not yet documented.If we choose to take collateral, MS can post either cash or letters of credit.   If they post cash, EPMI contractually can invest those funds as we see fit but will be required to pay interest at the Fed Funds interest rate.Give me a call if you have any questions.Bill\n"

Please mention to Caroline we are not trying to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.   Also, when we talk about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.   (We can also address her issue later---I agree with you on that.)   Proceed, but I'm not sure about the JV with ENA issue.   Let's not go down that road \"officially\".By the way, rough is spelled roof.Later...Jeff\tPer Sekse\t02/14/20001 10:14 AM \t\t\t To: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: My call this morning was re Hedge Fund Coverage for GMI know you're busy so here are my thoughts.The hedge fund business has expanded enough to warrant at least two people covering it. It makes sense that Enron has one person focussed on the natgas business since it is 90% of what we book right now. We're also about to get one of the funds trading power.   Caroline Abramo focusses on this and will continue to do so reporting to Fred. If for some reason that relationship doesn't work out, we can revisit it with her at that time.To build up the crude oil and products trading we should have a similar person devoted to covering the hedge funds. That person should work for GM and work in partnership with ENA, kind of a JV between our groups, but with the origination for each product staying with the appropriate business unit, as you plan to do.   Given that, I would recommend putting Russell Dyk in that role, have him spend the next 2 months working on the crude desk to kick start the coverage and then move him to NY. He and Caroline would share the hedge fund client base and back each other up when busy or travelling. If we need more support, we can add an associate to work for them jointly in NY. Overall, we're leveraging our hedge fund relationships to generate more origination income for Enron.This model also fits with the reality of hedge fund coverage at Enron, i.e. you need marketers with specific product knowledge close to the trading desks dealing direct with the fund traders. Enron Metals has their own people doing this today. We're simply expanding the concept to GM. Ultimately, when we get Enron under one rough in NY, the metals, oil and gas specialists woukld be able to jointly cover the clients, while providing market expertise as needed.If you agree this makes sense, then I can tell Fred that we plan to put our own person in NY.What do you think? I can stop by to discuss further any time today.Per   \n"

This seems to reflect fresh doubts about Iraq's speedy return to the market.Despite reports that loadings are resuming at Ceyhan, our sources believe that Iraqi export volumes are likely to remain below normal levels.   These sources assess that Iraq is continuing to insist on the surcharges.   Some companies will steer clear of any Iraqi oil; others will try to find a way to resume exports without being accused of paying a surcharge.   In any case, it will be difficult for Iraq to ramp up to 2 mb/d by Feb 1 as projected by a SOMO official at the OPEC meeting last week.Bayoil has reportedly signalled that Iraqi exports are likely to resume normal levels by the end of the month.   However, sources advise that Bayoil is considered to be an unconventional player compared to the traditional major lifters of Iraqi crude, and it is an especially aggressive buyer of Iraqi oil.   It may be willing to do business with Iraq sooner than the more established players.   Therefore, it might be incorrect to assume that firms are ramping up Iraqi liftings across the board based solely on indications from Bayoil.Iraq averaged around 6000,000 b/d in December.   According to news reports, 13 mb of Basra Light and 4 mb of Kirkuk have been exported so far in January.   \n"

This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas trading desk activities. Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than natural gas projects. They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 and #582. The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd starting in 1Q 20003. Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur. Plans are to build a private pipeline to Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore. Peggy is finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude on either a fixed or floating basis. The floating could be tied to a Platt's index or the NYMEX. It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last look from Murphy when the time is right. Another alternative is to give Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for the new production barrels. Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis differential for this quality of crude for Cal 20003?   \n"

You can bet that Mr. Damit at Brunei LNG gets his intelligence from Shell who no doubt are working on this already(Shell is in a JV that just rolled out an online shipping capacity/freight trading business this month).The first one to launch an LNG Trading internet platform will have an incredible advantage over all others. Dan06:19 GMT   14 September 2000   PATTAYA, Thailand (Dow Jones)---Online liquefied natural gas trading is on the way and will challenge the way business in the industry is done, Mohammed Damit, head of LNG marketing for Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd, said this week at a gathering of gas industry executives. \"It's only a matter of time before we see energy trading activities on the net,\" Damit said, adding that the biggest LNG online opportunities arein ship chartering and spot LNG trading. Damit said online trading would result in greater price volatility. LNG prices are currently indexed to crude oil prices, in term contracts for as long as 20-30 years, that tend to smooth out price fluctuations over the life of the contract. Damit added that online traders will use standardized documents, simplifying trading. -By Lucy Hornby, Dow Jones Newswires; 65 421 48111; lucy.hornby@dowjones.com   \n"

I'll be out of the office beginning Monday, October 2, returning on Monday, October 16.In my absence, Shanna Funkhouser will be handling all EGM issues.   David Oxley has offered his assistance during this 2 week period as well.   I will be in touch with both Shanna and David while I'm gone to address any critical issues.   I have asked Shanna to attend the EGM OOC Staff Meetings in my absence.   On another note, and I recognize there are signficant business issues you both are dealing with, but we need to start thinking about the PRC process.   Specific questions that EGM business heads have asked are: With the exception of VP's and above, do we want to isolate EGM employees and review them only within EGM, regardless of location? Or, do we want to segregate those EGM employees below VP that were formerly EEL or ENA and review them separately with EEL or ENA?   (ex., Europe, Singapore, Sydney, etc. employees review with EEL;   North American based employees review with ENA We'll have to integrate the former CALME employees as well. Shawna and I have ascertained that your management team would prefer a separate EGM PRC so employees can be evaluated with peers in global emerging markets, rather than with mature (and high revenue generating) markets like North America gas and power.Obviously, this is your call.   But time is growing near to plan for whatever direction we decide to go in.   The PRC system opens for feedback on approx. 10/20/000.   PRC meetings need to be held between 111/20/000 and 12/15/000.Thanks,Cindy\n"

        " Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT on 12/27/2000 10:59 AM ---   \tFrom:   Mark Smith @ ENRON   12/21/2000 12:09 PM To: Anthony Sexton/NA/Enron@Enroncc: john.romero@mms.gov, Russell Dyk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kenneth Shulklapper/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mog Heu/NA/Enron@Enron (bcc: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT)Subject: Re: PADD V-California Gas Injection   Anthony, Here is what I can add:1. Looks like the Conventional Steam Boilers used by producers in the field (average boiler: 50 Million Btu/hr, uses 14000 mmbtu/day of gas) that have been shut-in, use approx... 1000,000- 150,000 mmbtu/day of gas   (mainly, Texaco, Chevron, and independents).   This number can vary depending on which majors have firm transport on the pipelines and don't have to pay spot SOCAL Border prices.   This steam generation is used in either Steam Floods or Cyclic Steam Operations.2. Crude production has probably not been affected, but if the injections stay down, you could see production start to fall off in 3 or 4 months.   Crude prices in California are very weak right now (Kern River diffs are $10-13 under WTI when they normal run in the $5.80/$6.10 area).   Majors that have downstream facilities have outlets for their crude and probably have no plans to cut production.   Independents are seeing weakness on the buying side for the West Coast Independents and majors that normally buy their crude.   It might be 2-3 months before things clean up a bit out there on the crude side.3. Gas injection-   The question here is due producers decide to risk the integrity of their reservoir's by reducing pressure and not injecting the gas.   This probably would only be done for a month or two.   Noone wants to damage any of their wells.   This volume is not well known, but in the overall picture really shouldn't affect prices that significantly.   Usually this gas is pretty sour and does not command a high price.   This would also be the cheapest source or gas for producers to use (if they bought any make-up gas for their process).4. Referring to the question #2, the majority of EOR methods used in California are Steam Floods and Cyclic Steam Processes.   The oil is very heavy and needs HEAT in order to recover it out of the ground.   Just injecting gas would not accomplish this.   There are a lot of CO-GEN units that generate steam for most of the Majors and these are not being shut-in or slowed down.   Only sustain high gas prices for 6 months would probably start affecting Crude production.   Let's remember that in 19998-9 crude prices were extremely low and normal gas prices didn't change what most producers did, because if they shut-in too many wells, the production would never come back.If you have anymore questions, please let me know.   ThanksMarkAnthony Sexton12/20/2000 12:222 PMTo: john.romero@mms.govcc: Russell Dyk/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kenneth Shulklapper/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mog Heu/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Smith/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: PADD V-California Gas InjectionHello, John.Again, thanks for your cooperation.Summary:A West gas trader received news from Seneca Resources stating that California crude producers that use natural gas injection (or gas lifting?) for secondary and tertiary recovery methods may stop injection and - instead - sell the gas into the market to benefit from the record high natgas prices.   That being so, one wonders how much natural gas will be put back into the market and how California crude yields will be affected.   Here are some specific questions that may help us:How often is natural gas used in California to enhance crude production (including gas injection/lifting, steam injection, and hot water injection)?   Is this really a significant issue?What is the law concerning onshore gas injection?   If the gas was bought (not produced) by the crude producer, is the crude producer obligated to recover the injected gas?   If yes, must 1000% of the gas be proven to be recoverable?On average, how much natgas volume is injected in an oil field to recover production?What is an approximate number of producing oil fields in California and/or PADD 5What is the average size of these crude reservoirs?How many of these fields use natgas for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) - reiterating question #1?Is there a unit estimate of approximately how many MMBtus/Mcfs of natgas is needed to produce 1 barrel of crude onshore?How would stopping gas injection/lifting affect crude supply in California? Would crude wells be shut-in?   If so, how would that affect future efforts to produce from them?Will a significant amount of crude be held from the market - especially in the PADD 5/Western region?What commodities are substitutes for natgas in secondary/tertiary EOR and how liquid are they in the West?   How feasible, expeditious, and economical is it for any producing oil field to use another substance for EOR?John, I really appreciate your willingness to help unearth this information.   The priority on this matter is urgent, so we would be extra grateful for a prompt response.   Please do not hesitate to call me at 713-853-6304, Russell Dyk at 713-853-73332, or Ken Shulklapper at 713-853-70009 for any further questions or comments.Sincerely,Anthony\n"

Mark Tawney, my supervisor, has made a few attempts to set up a meeting for the three of us to discuss a few issues involving my performance and status in the group.   I believe that I have applied myself over the last seventeen months to produce significant results in my book and for the group.   My portfolio is up $6.7M YTD (12/17/000) which represents a significant contribution to the group's total revenues this year.   The issue here is that despite this significant contribution among other contributions to the group my performance has been portrayed in the PRC process as sub-standard and worthy of demotion.   I do not believe that this is just and would like to get this issue addressed.   As a result I would like to set up an appointment to speak with you about this matter.I have attached a report of my trading performance through 12/17/000 for your review.   I have done this only because I know your position as President/COO of Global Markets grants you access to this information.Regards,BrandoPS: Mark has just passed by to tell me you can meet in January.   However, I would still like you to have this message.\n"

The idea is that we will buy the crude oil from a North Sea producer to a fixed price. The duration could be for the next 4-6 years depending on how comfy we are with the exposure. By buying future oil to a fixed price at lower numbers than the future curve would suggest and paying upfront (due to time value of money), the producer will end up paying less tax.This has been tried many times before by different banks and never worked. This time Chris Harris thinks that by presenting the correct package it might pass.   We will see.However, in case of   success, we will have to do two things.1. sell futures for the next 4-6 yrs, volume could be 25-50' bpd.2. sell the physical bbls.Number 2 is no problem and depending on the volume I think number 1 should be OK. We might have to hedge thru WTI, but will try Brent.Question: with a deal like this do we need any signatures from above? Chris Harris will be happy to run a full presentation if required.regardschris glaas   \n"

Attached is the resume of a personal friend of mine, Robert Brown (Bobby), who may be a good fit for your group.   He is a '97 University of Pennsylvania graduate (3.1 GPA) with a degree in Economics and an International Finance concentration.   Additionally, he holds Series 7, 63, 65 licenses.   Bobby had expressed an interest in Enron to me some time ago, but didn't want to pursue anything at the time as he was going to be traveling for quite a while.   He contacted me last week, ready to explore opportunities at Enron.   Upon reading his resume, I felt it is very much in line with many of the other resumes I'd surfaced for you and Lavorato to you last month (given to you by Ted Bland).   He's very bright, ambitious and I feel would fit very well into the Enron environment.Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions!Amyx58034&lt;&lt; - Resume.doc\n"

I feel that you should run this meeting.   Iwould like to accomplish the following:1) Discuss our Vision for the collection2) Introduce Ned and Barry3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable5) Discuss the process:   To what extent Jeff wants to be part of thedecision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Visionand having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)   Thelatter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but wedefinitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.Questions right now for you:1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so shouldwe postpone?   Barry is a \"maybe\".   Remember they are there to help us shapea high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make anypurchasing \"mistakes\".3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it?Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed listof potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) sothat we have a Master from which to work.   I will run it by Bonnie McCloudand Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we areconsidering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler todiscuss where his piece might fit in the new building.   I have also placed acall   Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them tomeet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would liketo propose a \"water piece\" for the circular drive.   You will recall thatPelli would very much like to have a water piece there.   Eliasson is verywell respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow \"up\" andwonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.   I've askedhis gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or inHouston on their next trip.Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hangingin 50M.   Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Lea - Enron Art Collection Vision.doc\n"

To clarify my discussion with you last week, while Gary's oversight is a key part of the deal I am uncomfortable with Gary's comments to Chris that I have simply introduced the deal and that Gary will make the sole decision on this deal.Jeff, these guys have been introduced to me on a personal basis and the discussions are based on a large element of trust.   I see the strongest potential for this project working under the SPV structure outlined in our discussions.   More importantly, I see a unique opportunity to develop the trading technology in a setting   removed from the typical structure (but not from controls).

In all honesty, the overall environment and rhythm of the floor are the things I have enjoyed most and I can now better understand how these elements have been successfully applied to new ventures. I will be due for rotation in about 2 months and have started to attend brownbag lunches hosted by the various ENRON divisions. The one I enjoyed most was given by the ENRON Networks' E-Commerce group and its relationship with the Houston Technology Center. This group was initially signalled to me by an associate friend of mine working there as an ENRON loaned executive who is also due for rotation in December.   From what I gathered, the group's goal to bring together entrepreneurs, new technologies, and venture capitalists could be a good match with my skills and interests.I recall you mentioning Networks to me as a possible rotation and would be very grateful if I could benefit from your feedback and advice on the matter. I thank you again for your assistance and hope all is well in Global Markets.Massimo   \n"

Things seem to be coming to a head there.   Southern Co. was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from the terminal.   We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by Les.   I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this.So. Co.'s latest offer was Hub + $.12 for all 160,000 dt/d.   So. Co. wants 1000,000 dt/d at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the remaining 60,000 dt/d at Elba or Destin at our option.   We have not discussed what a price at Destin should be.   So. Co. has some leverage with El Paso that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below.   Additionally, they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and significantly improve the btu issue at Elba.We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday.   Let me know if you have any questions.---",
        " Phil DeMoes/Corp/Enron on 111/20/2000 07:28 AM ---Les Webber @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT111/18/2000 03:47 PMTo: Doug Arnell/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Nancy Corbet/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Daniel R Rogers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, byamagata@akingump.com, masseye@arentfox.comcc: Shelley Corman@ENRON, Phil DeMoes/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David L Fairley@ECT Subject: SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINALGREETINGS:On November 17, 2000 Southern LNG advised the FERC that it \"has determined to withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate application\", such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate issued by the FERC in March, 2000 authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the LNG terminal at Elba Island.With this withdrawal, the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the sand.   We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the 15 day period allowed by FERC procedures.   This gives us until December 2, 2000 to file which, presumably, would be extended until Monday, December 4, 2000.Our filing will be of an adversarial nature, so the Enron organization needs to be on board with our intended filing, which we will commence drafting on November 20, 2000.   Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel, so please advise us re any additions in that regard.At the same time, this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy.   We have come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter Agreement/Term Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October 13, 1999, inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor, including several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling.   We will discuss the path forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November 21-222, 2000.While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our commercial flexibility and optionality intact, we must be positioned to move forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy and Southern LNG.   We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss alternative solutions.On Wednesday, November 15, 2000, we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins of El Paso Merchant Energy a \"heads-up\" regarding our likely response to Southern LNG's proposed letter agreement dated November 1, 2000.   We indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding into the Vaporizer Project, that could proceed quickly and on an independent path to certification, and the Stabilization Project, that required considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed.   When I contacted Mike Varagona on Friday, November 17, 2000, after we received a copy of Southern LNG's letter to the FERC, he stated that he had not been advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision, hence, had not been positioned to return the favor.Mr. Varagona will be in Houston on November 21 and 222, and he wants to meet with us.   He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso \"take on the quality risk\" in return for our firming up our volumes to El Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx. $0.08 per MMBtu.   Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a solution to the quality issue at little or no cost.   He said he would like to prepare us an outline of an offer. to which I responded that he had nothing to lose by doing so.   The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and for El Paso to respond with \"I don't think that will work\".Mr. Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter Agreement/Term Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our respective companies - \"It just won't work!\".   As a consequence, he stated that Clarke Smith, head of El Paso Merchant Energy, has already contacted or will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve this matter. Apparently, these gentlemen have developed a good working relationship over the years.   He also alluded to the possibility that Mr. Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton (for less than obvious reasons to me).   Mr. Varagona further advised me that a Duke/Williams joint venture had just acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal (divestment of this asset was required, I understand, as part of the El Paso/Coastal merger).   \"This situation gives added impetus to development of the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso.\"There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal.   However, we may find it desirable to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear.   However, should we decide to so compromise, we must either fully engage Southern LNG in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement with El Paso.   In the case of Southern LNG, we are dealing with one or more individuals who see only one way to do things. namely their way, and who are totally opposed to working with Enron.   I would recommend any compromise with El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with Southern LNG on explicit terms acceptable to us (and checking it twice).I would appreciate receiving your comments, if any, before Thanksgiving.Regards.Les Webber\n"

Things have been progressing nicely between the LNG guys and Southern Company.   The LNG guys asked me if ENA needed to get some MTM from Elba, they would be willing to quicken the pace on putting a deal together.   Probably rushing is not in the best interest of Enron buy it could be done.   Anyhow, I have legal and structuring working on this and we may need you to help negotiate a transfer price between ENA and Enron Global at some point.I think no matter what happens prospectvely at Elba, Southern Co has probably saved the LNG group up to $50MM of capital clean up their off spec gas along with provided a much better price of Hub +$.12 vs our current put option of Hub + $.02 with El Paso which is an additional $36.5 MM improvement.

In New York City, 217 corps members are teaching in&lt;Harlem, the South Bronx, and Washington Heights.   In over seventy public&lt;schools in these communities, our teachers pursue the vision that inspired&lt;Teach For America's founding in 1989: One day, all children in this nation&lt;will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education.&lt;&lt;The Second Annual Teach For America Benefit&lt;Show Your love for NYC Public School Teachers&lt;Where: The Supper Club&lt;When: February 13th, 20001 7:000 p.m.-10:000 p.m.&lt;Who: over 4000 young professionals&lt;What: cocktails, dinner, an inspirational panel with well-known&lt;celebrities, intellectual discourse, information about Teach For America's&lt;mission, and dancing.&lt;&lt;Come to the Event?&lt;Education is important. Achieving our vital mission of educational equity&lt;for all children takes more than vision and energy; we need the financial&lt;resources to continue our work. Raising awareness about the program will&lt;not only help our efforts to recruit the nation's most outstanding&lt;graduates to teach, it will also inspire our supporters to explore the&lt;challenges and opportunities in New York's most disadvantaged schools.

Gore is trending favorably in large vote-rich states including not only Florida and Ohio, but also New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well as traditional Democratic strongholds such as Minnesota and Wisconsin.   One caveat is that today's NYT Florida poll is the flip of yesterday's Florida Sun Sentinel Florida poll that showed Bush leading (46-41).

Jeff\tDavid P Dupre\t02/26/20001 06:53 AM \t\t\t To: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: UpdateI am pleased that Jason Fischer is doing a fine job as he took my place in the role of checking out NYMEX trades and formulating newrelationships with brokers.One of the key aspects of this job was moving trades to brokerage houses with credit financing available at no cost.   Basically,the brokerage houses want to capture the brokerage fees, in volume, and believe that they are able to not worry about chargingfor the credit lines.I'd like to meet you with about this.   An contact of mine in accounting and I developed a spreadsheet (see attached: Xpit analysis) to measurehow much we are able to save by these movements.   Also, according to the accomplishments list, you'll notice that because of our actions on Fri Oct13 directed by John Wilson in Products, only for CL, HO, and HU, we were able to see an instantaneous change from paying out millions each day to the numerous brokers to having millions of dollars wired to us by the brokers.One of the critical functions of my former job was to manage the positions of all futures and optionsfor all commodities.   From my experience in working closely with the traders, we discovered, especially onFriday, October 13, that moving positions to brokerage houses with credit financing dramatically reduced our margin expenses thus increasing our daily cashflow in our wired brokerage accounts. Most of September and the week of Oct 9 had negative cashflows.In addition, I worked with our global finance group, (Sarah Wesner) , to increase existing lines and openother lines of credit at other brokerage houses.This action, provided we monitor this vigilantly and remind the traders on a frequent basis to stayfocused on clearing trades with houses that have financing, will save Enron millions of dollars everyday.Our treasury group, (Mary Perkins), is pleased with this type of financing approach as weare using the additional money to reduce Enron's short term debt. I have informed my former group (esp. Jason Fischer) of the tremendous value which my priorfunction may add to Enron's financial well-being. It is this type of proactive thinking and creative financing that I hope to generate in my next rotations. Currently, I am in EnronCredit.com.Furthermore, now that I am in the analyst program, I'd like to discuss with you in the late summer/early fall for rotation opportunities.ThanksDavid3-3528\n"

I thought it would be of interest to both of you as well.Gentlemen,We have sent the final version of the CA to Hallwood to be signed, hopefully we will receive information either tomorrow or early next week and have a preliminary valuation and structure proposal by the end of next week.   We are negotiating a CA with Nuevo and they appear anxious to get started.   Their general counsel told me they have prepared a box of due diligence items to be delivered as soon as we agree on certain terms.   The DevX CA should be finalized today as well and we will get started on that prospect hopefully next week also.   We are still waiting on information from Chesapeake, but I spoke with Marc Rowland last week and he is getting his new reserve report finalized and will send it to us when it ready.   Benton is progressing albeit slowly because of the complicated nature of the structure.   We are also analyzing a new transaction that another group within Enron has originated and structured a VPP around but they may not have favorable financing.   It could represent an opportunity for both of you to see if a small equity participation in the SPV is of interest.   That's it, call me if you have any questions or comments. \"Porter, Stuart\" &lt;porters@hmc.harvard.edu&lt; on 02/13/20001 07:48:08 AMTo: \"'doug.jones@enron.com'\" &lt;doug.jones@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: Doug,I just wanted to say that you handled Hallwood perfectly. Also if it is timeto move on other fronts --- Benton / Nuevo --- I am ready to go. I think Nuevowill probably be under pressure in the next few weeks after missing 4q andreducing reserves.Stu\n"

Unfortunately, there is some intra-day trading and long term strategic trading for Energy Trend and JBlock.   The Risk Management group have started breaking out intra-day trading for FGH   and PAN-NAT, and they are currently in the process of breaking-out Energy Trend and JBlock.   This process requires setting up new books and re-booking new deals.   However, the graph below should give you an idea of how much VaR these deals are eating up.   I will send an updated graph once all books are successfully setup.   \n"

He expressed a number of areas of concern, some pertaining to the tone of the paper and others to its accuracy.I acknowledged his concerns and promised to do my best to improve the tone and clarify any inaccuracies.   We will revisit with our sources to clarify the following issues:1. Will the new Hydrocarbons Law just address liquid hydrocarbons or will it address gas hydrocarbons?   What details are available on the proposed law?2. If the new law does affect gas, will it in effect overturn the 1999 Gas Law?3.   Will gas tariffs be separate for transportation, distribution, and upstream, or will there be a single unified tariff?   Is there a dispute between PDVSA and the   Ministry of Mines and Energy on how this should be handled?4. What is the current royalty and tax structure on gas?   Will it be affected by the new HydroCarbons Law?5. What are the current renegotiation dynamics of the Cristobal Colon project between the government and foreign operators?Once we have revisited with sources, I told Emilio that we will be happy to correct any subsequent errors.   However, if we reconfirm the information in the paper then perhaps the three of us can confer on how to proceed.This has been a difficult assignment because we are essentially dealing with areas that are subject to interpretation and forecasting.   Emilio and I disagreed in some areas about the Chavez agenda, while agreeing in others.   Also, because the HydroCarbons Law has not yet been written, we can only go on what sources in country are saying.   Clearly, we have conflicting information and will work to clear up the contradictions ASAP.I suggest we postpone our Thursday meeting until both Emilio and I have time to conduct further follow-ups.   As I have said to both you and Emilio, the CABC role here is not to take any position on the merits of the deal, but rather to answer the specific concerns brought up by RAC.   Hopefully, these next steps will resolve the situation in mutually satisfying manner.RJ\n"

I've heard about 6 different ones so far.   One of the problems we will run into is that they all look into different way of setting up contracts.   That can create a situation where we don't get anyone to concentrate about any \"standard\" solution.   By cooperating with them can we probably control the development, but we can also try to keep them in the \"dark\" so we get people to use EOL more.

As a consequence spot/Q2 prices are nowtrading at $2 discount to replacement from South Africa ($40.75 FOB ARA versus $42.75 replacement) - a concept which many arestruggling to get their head round. The Lion's share of the resell mkt is South African which makes sense as the strong U.S. mkt has taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline. In truth, while the U.S. mkt has been steaming, only very limited incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U.S. as the Utilities only pay up for spot spot material. If the steep backwardisationin the U.S. rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that thestrong U.S domestic market will keep U.S. exports into Europe very low. PacificVery few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe over the last few months and this has been a function of the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to the consolidation which has been going on, the latest development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic slowdown.   At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is$3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle.GameplanWe are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We willcontinue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on pricesif the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading ourway which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sellout of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from theArmada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities whilethe mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering anything further forward.RgdsJez\n"

Please plan on attending the meeting.   If you can't make the meeting, please let me know what area of recruiting you are interested in participating in.

I want to let you know I'm trying very hard to focus and work with Niamh in London, learn as much about reisd, and trade into what we think are solid positions.   So far I feel like its been going better than I even expected, but I know I have a lot more to learn.   I'm enjoying this product and working in EGM.   I'm trying to manage this Penn thing on the side and still help out Jenn and Fundamentals when they need it.   I'm begining to see what it means to be streched thin, something I'm sure you experience quite often.   I do want you to feel like you can ask me anything.   I'm here to express my ideas to you or if you feel like I'm not working hard enough, I'd like to know.   I've really appreciated everything you've done.Sarah\n"

He is viewed as one of the most valuable people in the business and there was no controversy whatsoever in London about his promotion.   In fact I repeatedly get calls for his services from various groups around Europe who would love to hire him if they had the opportunity.   In Oslo he has been one of the main contributors behind most off our models, and I think that the job he has done with setting up the Weather desk here in Oslo deserves very positive feedback, even if we didn't make money last year.   We have really moved up the deal flow and are poised for an outstanding year 20001 in Weather.In the future I will obviously cross check all things like this with you and Mark, so there aren't any misunderstandings going forward.

I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.   When I look at the P&amp;L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and I don't think that deserves this promotion.   What else does he do?   I'm also concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.   His promotion has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.   Jeff\n"

Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain bus.   The mother was running late for work and could not wait.   I couldn't say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus.   It was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus.   On top of   things, I had quiz at 8am.   Which I then realized I missed.   I decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own.   I asked her if she had any relatives that   would want to know of her whereabouts.   I called her grandmother and explained things to her.   Pretty strange...aye. A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I couldn't do it.   Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to accompany me to school (8:30am).   There were only 15 minutes left of class.   I stayed for the remainder of the lecture. After class we went back to bus stop and within minutes her bus arrived.   I told the bus driver where to drop her off.   I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.   And I was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe.\n"

So first party may be feb 24.   any thoughts?I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly friend, only then letting her know she's invited.   maybe tell her the wrong time.When are you off to san fran?   I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out there at some stuffy, but cool store off union square.Alexandra Saler@EES01/17/20001 08:39 AMTo: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: how are you?   do you have the Dido CD?   if not, I am going to get it for you.   I love it.   Beth called, and I am going to get the Palm.   She wanted me to get the Blackberry, which is the new awesome one, but of course it doesn't work on the Enron system.   my dad just called and yelled at me again that he wants his bitch invited to my sister's shower.   he swore that she would not go, so the whole thing is so stupid.   I am out of invites.   can I send her an email about it?   this is the last thing that I have time to worry about.   what is going on with you?   I am sure that you have another crazy day.   write back when you can!\n"

I have a HR problem that we need to address immediately.   Today we let Britta Dinndahl go.   Her termination was a case study in how to screw up a termination.   She was let back onto the trading floor where she called and email people telling them about her termination.   I understand from Chris Mahoney that (neither Nigel nor) Yvonne Scoroer was ready to handle this today, even though they had been briefed many times about her upcoming termination.   It wasn't until early afternoon that I called Phillipe Bibi to tell him of her termination, when she was taken off system access.   In addition Yvonne has had Erik Hansen's contract for over three weeks and has not produced paper for Erik to sign.   It was my hope to have him under contract before the bonus period.   Further Jen Fraser was trying to hire Andrew Hill as a new employee for the Fundamentals group in London, and on three occasions Yvonne told Jonny Palmer that she would get an offer letter to him \"today\".   It took three weeks.Obviously these are extremely serious lapses, and I do not want Yvonne involved in any more Enron Global Markets.   Cindy and Shanna have done a heroic job for us in the U.S. and they have been extremely frustrated with their counterparts in London.Thanks for addressing this issue.Jeff\n"

It's also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from LNG coming in to Elba.   Nothing will be committed to without considering all the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.

I'm not sure I'm worthy of your being concerned either   (I don't deserve it---I'd guess)   You know, after we talked the other day, I felt better for a while.   I don't know what to say, and I'm sure I'm embarrassed by this whole thing---most particularly how I've handled our relationship.   I really want to see you, but I need some time to myself I guess.   I do know glen doesn't have all the answers, but I find him to be impartial and helpful---really the only one these days.   My mother suggested a trip home this weekend, and i may go.   I wish this were easy...I think part of my issue is I've always felt our friendship is one I wanted to keep always, and I feel I tend to jeopardize friendships...\"Lisa A.

Hopefully, since it's the weekend your week willonly get better, but as for my part in it, if any, I'm losing patience.I don't know whether to be concerned about you or offended by you.   It'sincreasingly difficult to be both.   Since you don't call as much as tocheck in with me or respond to my calls, clearly you don't want to botherwith me and aren't particularly concerned whether I'm ok or not, and I haveto resist the urge to call and check on you because you are unresponsiveand seemingly untruthful, so I feel foolish even trying.   As a result, I'mleaning more and more toward the offended/annoyed side.Maybe Glen will have \"all the answers\" for you, but I don't think that'spossible and I think you just need to accept it and move forward.   It willall pass and you will be fine in the long run.

I had a freak out attack though b/c I thought I lost the Saks bag with the $6000 bracelet in it and was running around Neiman's like an idiot.   Then I remembered that I DROVE from Saks to Neiman's and it was in my car.   I think I was just a little bit on edge last night!   I met my friend at Barnaby's for dinner and then got under the covers and finished my book.   It was great.   By the way, I wish I dragged you to the singing b/c Sarah, the 10 month old cutest baby on the planet was there.   She was clapping and singing along the whole time which was the cutest thing especially b/c she was on my lap the entire time.   It was worth sitting through a horrible rendition of every Hanukkah song you have ever heard! How about your buddy Jeff!!!   Have you congratulated him yet?   That is great!To: Alexandra Saler/HOU/EEES@EEScc:   Subject: Re:   That glass of wine did the trick---I felt better   (more relaxed too!)

We have given back 25 million this quarter, and very few traders took profits at any time.   I expect traders to lose money at times, but we have other constraints.   I'd be happy to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will get to our numbers next year. Of course spread trading is a good idea, but when I look at the portfolio in aggregate, the position story I'm being told doesn't make sense.   We'll get there.

I would suggest we move to traderstelling what the main positions are in their books (3 max) and then give a bullish (max +2) to bearish (max -2) view of their mkt.   If wemoved more quickly through this we might have time for more meaningful discussion at the end.   I think that the discussion at theend we can keep flexible but for instance when we have major issues like spr sales or an opec meeting we should delegate somebodyto do a review of that.   In terms of the wed meeting, unless there is something special, I would recommend letting the new researchanalyst we have hired in London do a quick API review.The issue of high volatility in the markets makes a good argument for lowering position sizes but the issue of not havingany money to lose won't ever go away.   I base that statement on the premise that with the budget for next year set at 175 millionwe will always be under pressure to meet budget and not give back any profits.   The books that have historically made the mostmoney in enron global products have been more spread trading/view oriented rather then flat price/momentum oriented.   I knowyou would prefer we move away from this and become more the latter but I would encourage you to consider the fact that we havelittle edge in forecasting short term price movements but hopefully have enough staying power and experience to position ourselvescorrectly for the big moves.   \tFrom:   Jeffrey A Shankman   23/10/2000 222:14 To: John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Don Schroeder/HOU/ECT@ECT, David J Botchlett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Mahoney/LON/ECT@ECT, Ross Koller/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the following:   Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy   (?),   and no real weather anywhere in the world.   I think it would be most prudent to play the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more aggressively.   I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.   Given that, and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk   (not front to backs, but commodity spreads).   The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for everyone's passion with respect to the markets.   As such, I'd like to ask John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.   Thanks.   Jeff\n"

His stated intention is to shadow Clay and his team to help arrange LNG supplies for Metgas.   We do not need this and it adds a layer of confusion whenever he is in attendance in negotiations, but to date neither Wade nor Sanjay has been willing or able to control this.   The India group tends to blame their failure to market Metgas supplies on the LNG team's \"failure\" to get better terms, and they insist that Bobby or others attend the meetings to ensure that we are doing a good job.We believe that we have obtained LNG for Metgas on favorable terms, particularly in light of the fact that we have convinced Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to accept the credit risk of Metgas customers, i.e., with no Ennron support in the middle and no Indian government support behind the buyers).   They believe that our supplies are priced 50 cents above the \"market\", which they perceive to be Qatari supplies to Petronet ( a proposed government-backed LNG import project in Western India that is a long way from being real).   We believe that we know the pricing terms for the proposed Petronet deal and that the price is not as low as rumored.   We also believe that the Metgas customers are willing to pay the price that we have negotiated and that the Metgas pipeline economics are sound (although the India group has been unwilling to share their economics with us) and that, once the LNG contracts are in place, we can reduce the LNG price significantly via a backhaul from Malaysia using ADGAS/TEPCO ships.   We can further reduce the price if we can get access to the spare capacity on the ship dedicated to DPC and use it to move incremental cargoes from Abu Dhabi to Metgas.Bobby and his team want us to reopen the price in the Mayasia term sheet.   We do not intend to do this.   Malaysia has told us that they will walk the deal if we insist on a lower price.   Malaysia recently sold additional volumes to Japan for a price about 20 cents higher than the price to Metgas and they believe they can also sell our volumes at a higher price to more creditworthy buyers in the far east.The Malaysia COI includes a cp that Metgas will finalize contracts with its end buyers by Sep 1999.   We have repeatedly   gotten Malaysia to extend this target date, which is now end October 2000, but Malaysia is getting impatient with India and I am not sure how much longer we can hold this together without some more firm evidence from India that the markets are realI will be in India on Oct 4/5 to meet with Sanjay and Wade to discuss this.   We will also try to finalize the terms for us to provide LNG   fuel management and shipping services to both DPC and Metgas, and will seek clarification from Wade/Sanjay as to how they intend to sell down DPC/Metgas without losing control of the LNG terminal.   Clay, V V RAo and Wayne Perry will be with me.Working with India is never easyRick   \tFrom:   Jeffrey A Shankman @ ECT   09/222/2000 04:444 PM To: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc:   Subject: I'm hearing a little noise about Bobby Ferris in Sanjay's group.

This is a 2000,000 barrel per day refinery capable of using heavy crude oil and has a 75,000 barrel a day coker unit. They own a 12.5% interest in the Orion refinery (formerly called Goodhope) and Credit Suisse and First Boston own a combined 68% equity share. Jack Stanley, who was involved in this refinery in the past has no current or future ownership or involvement in the refinery. I told S&amp;W that it was a prerequisite that Mr. Stanley not be involved in any way before I would send them a standard ENA confidentiality agreement and start preliminary discussions about our role with the refinery. So far they have neither offered, nor asked Enron for any equity involvement, but rather are focused on us proposing physical liquid fuels and risk management structures. I am waiting for S&amp;W to schedule a meeting in Baton Rouge with their top management to discuss their plans and how we can assist. Hopefully, this will lead to something tangible and I will bring you into the picture so we can do some kind of financial structure or equity along with, or in lieu of, the supply/offtake angle. I realize refineries have been a non-starter with Mr. Skilling, but with good crack spreads and new management within EGM maybe there is a possibility here. Please keep this very confidential. Regards,Doug\n"

I'd like you to believe that trading, and management, particularly your leadership, will pay off for you.Later...Jeff\tChris Mahoney\t01/31/20001 03:02 PM \t\t\t To: Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: discussionjeff,when I came to Houston in late December there were, if you recall,   a number of issues thatI had hoped to discuss with you.   We only really scratched the surface with the reorganisationannounced today.   I would prioritise them as follows:1) recruiting, training, and keeping talent.   there is a lack of depth in the organisation.   to make matters worse most of the recruiting wasdone by greg whalley and now all of those traders are on expiring or expired contracts.   thefact that all of them on the international side received bonuses less than last year doesn't help.   also the industry is expansion mode so it is harder to recruit and keep talent.   we arerunning the risk of getting left with the unhireable and losing the best.2) vision.   having worked for enron for three years i realise that the company seeks self-starters.   one ofthe frustrations that I have in Europe, and is a problem with the group overall, is that too many ofthe employees are on their heels waiting for direction from above.   that is one of the things I washoping we might address in a reorganisation that shrunk the business units.   smaller teams wouldbe more focused on opportunities to grow the business, communicate better, and energise theenvironment.   still we need as senior management to discuss in a more specific sense where weneed to improve the most.   you have identified customer business, eol, and research as the threekey areas.   I would like to discuss with you the priority of being able to sell physical fuels.   the easiestthing to do is get long expensive oil and the hardest thing to do is develop a system.   this group hasmade almost no progress in developing a physical system.   that is what I will be working on in the heating, diesel, and jet fuel markets.   I would have thought the greatest and first opportunity that weneed to be exploiting is fuel supply to utilities.   btu related shorts, that leverage upon our existing gas contacts, would seem to be our greatest inherent advantage vs our competition.   also it could focusour fuel oil and middle distillate group on the opportunities between gas and liquids.   The relationshipshave never been closer and this seems to be a situation that could remain for a long time.   the u.s. presents more opportunites but we are making good progress in developing financial hedgingbusiness in europe with continental gas and I'm pushing the origination groups in Europe to lookinto the physical supply opportunities.3) systems.I'm going to spend sometime with Brent Price tomorrow but my conclusion on doing the post-mortemon Spain is that we need to resource the back office significantly before we can significantly growthe business.   They are struggling to keep up at the moment and the process seems very bureaucraticand inefficient.   This worries me because if you look at the problems that we have gotten into in the pastwe don't seem to have made great progress in eliminating the probability of there reoccurance.now in terms of the situation with myself.   please put yourself in my shoes for a minute.   I have had nolife for the last year sorting out the crap of others (q1 - helsinki/q4 - spain).   in the middle part of the yearI had to spend much time addressing the people issues and other problems created by the vacumn of no managment in London for over a year.   Was able to coordinate a good profit on the gasoil books thatwas pissed away.   In addition, I have had to take back over the book because ross was not capableof managing the short gamma position that was chopping him up.   the point being that managing didn'tpay.   I have to run but these I want to discuss.   \n"

The synthetic crude produced by this plant has no bottoms. All other crude oils have at least some bottoms, therefore the demand on the replacement blending barrel will be higher than the volume of barrels lost. With the plant production down approximately 3.5 to 4.0 millions barrels, the impact ultimately will be an increase of wti demand during the Oct. 15-nov 15   approaching 130,000 b/d. Given the tightness of light sweet crude oil in padd 2, I believe this is significant. I think it was the main reason for x/z strengthening and the recent strength in z/f may also be attributed to this recent supply disruption. Until there are additional sweet barrels arbed into padd 2 from padd 3, I think we will see strength in the prompt spreads.\n"

Most people (including the majority of our shop) are getting bearish on the back of the builds we should have based upon iea supply/demand predictions.   One concern here is that they have materialized yet over q3.   If we look at the poor reaction to bullish news last week(api stats/unrest in the middle east) I think it is safe to say that the sentiment in the market has turned bearish.   In general I want to go with the majority of the mkt but the rally that resulted when the violence erupted in the middle east two weeks ago showsthe surprises will still be on the upside.   the way that we gave back all that ground reflects how little confidence there is in the mkt at the momentthat these fundamentals last too much longer.   How many reports have you read lately about borrowed heating oil demand?   my back of theevelope calculations suggest that although this is somewhat true it only true for 150kbd in the winter vs an underlying demand of 4000kbd somaybe not such a big disappointment to come.we still like being bullish distillate in europe for the winter but think that the mkt will be range bound on spreads and vs the complex until the needfor winter coats comes along.\n"

Six years ago, outside factors forced me to join my family business, which is in the entertainment industry.   Now, I am at a point where I can, and want, to return to what I originally did.   The Enron position describes the exact objectives I faced in developing my own company - selling to large commercial and industrial customers.   That is exactly what I did and did well.   But, I am afraid that if I send my resume to the Human Resource dept.   they will overlook my early experience and will be confused why a Broadway producer is applying for the job.   Do you happen to have any suggestions ?   Perhaps you might know someone in the New York office that I can meet with.   I am very interested in working for Enron and know that I posses the right skills.   I would greatly appreciate your advice.Thank you,Rina Kirshner\n"

These producers (talisman, kerr mcgee, lasmo, hess, enterprise, and a couple of others) arecurrently paying some 65-70% of the value of crude oil back to the government and they feel the cost savings to the producers is something on the line of 25% after financing costs for the pre-pay.   I have asked them to do a presentation to you, as if you were oneof the producers, for how this structure would work.   Can you advise when you would be free for this?   The volumes could be large(potentially upto 25 million bbls) and there is considerable basis risk in hedging these physical volumes.   we are looking into theprice that we could bid them for their physical oil that covers the basis risk.   It would be nice to try to combine this with some long-term gas supply contract on the continent that would require us to be buying fuel and gasoil as the hedge and we are approachingsome of the large natural gas buyers in continental europe to see if the recent spike in oil prices has encouraged more hedging.please let me know your thoughts on this and when/if you could be free for a presentation from chris harris.   thanks,chris.   \n"

Average differentials for all products over crude fell, with those for gasoline falling particularly strongly in line with very weak reported demand. FOB ARA barges for premium unleaded gasoline over Dated Brent averaged $1.51 per barrel, compared with $5.86 per barrel in October.* Jet/kerosene barge premiums over Dated Brent slipped by over $2.000 per barrel in November from October's average, but because of current market sentiment favoring prompt production of heating oil, they remained high at an average of $10.98 per barrel. Jet values had enjoyed the largest increase of all products during October's Middle East-related price increases; consequently jet/kerosene's premium over heating oil narrowed in November following an easing of tensions, averaging the month at $2.53 per barrel, compared with $3.29 per barrel over heating oil in October. * Despite falling by $1.333 per barrel from October's level, average 0.2% sulfur gasoil barge values remained very strong in November, averaging $8.45 per barrel over Dated Brent. High end-user prices for heating oil remain a strong deterrent to demand, however; provisional data for German heating oil demand in November show a fall of over 10 percent from November 1999 levels (to an average of 608,000 barrels per day [bd]).* Discounts of low sulfur (1.0%) heavy fuel oil to Dated Brent widened again in November, averaging $6.74 per barrel. As was discussed last month, much of the reason for their improvement in October was because of concerns over the availability in Russian exports: toward the end of October and into November, however, such concerns subsided, leading to a widening of discounts. High sulfur (3.5%) fuel oil discounts widened by $3.26 per barrel to an average of $9.61 per barrel to Dated Brent.Refinery Margins * Margins fell back considerably after the very high levels recorded in October, but still remained quite strong and reflect the current market sentiment of favoring maximum refinery production, especially of middle distillates. High jet/kerosene and gasoil/heating oil values kept margins buoyant, but falling gasoline premiums and widening heavy fuel oil discounts were the major downward influences. * Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross margins for simple/hydroskimming refineries in the ARA region fell by $2.80 per barrel over Dated Brent from October's level, averaging $1.19 per barrel in November. The deterioration in heavy fuel oil discounts accounted for half of the decline, with the large drop in gasoline values contributing $0.87 per barrel to the fall.* The drop in gasoline premiums was the principal reason for the fall in ARA complex/cracking refineries. Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross margins averaged $3.30 per barrel in November; this is $2.93 per barrel lower than October's average, of which $1.74 is attributable to the poorer gasoline premiums, with the remainder of the difference attributable equally to the declines in middle distillates and residual fuel oil values. European Inventories and Refinery Operations* * EU and Norwegian refinery crude intakes rose by a further 168,000 bd in November, averaging 12.6 million barrels per day (mbd), again an indication of refiners seeking to maximizing runs given the current favorable margins. Output data for individual products are not yet available, but the high crude runs and middle distillate margins would indicate that November was another month of very high jet/kerosene and gasoil production.* Despite the strong crude runs, primary EU plus Norway crude oil inventories did increase in November, ending the month 9 million barrels higher than October's level (which was revised downward) at 426.5 million barrels. There has been a small but consistent three-month contango in the Brent futures market, placing a small premium on forward months' values of crude to the current month's, which would help to encourage stockholding. These stocks represent about 31 days' forward supply of anticipated total demand in the first quarter of next year-less than 2 days' fewer supply compared with November levels for the past two years. * Primary gasoline inventories fell in November from 154 million barrels to 150 million barrels, contrary to typical seasonal patterns. This may reflect the relatively low levels of gasoline production over the past few months, and certainly current gasoline differentials to crude are not encouraging high gasoline production levels. Nevertheless, this is a potential cause for concern as it may lead to significant market volatility during the first quarter of next year. * Primary middle distillate inventories, however, are continuing to improve. October's total was revised upward slightly to 333 million barrels, and November ended at 3334 million barrels. In addition to record levels of refinery production, exports from Russia are proving to be plentiful, with November's total exports from the former Soviet Union averaging 460,000 bd. A strong transatlantic arbitrage, however, has been causing most of these cargoes to go direct to the United States rather than stay in Europe.***end*** This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours. *** This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Gasoline margins have returned to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at exceptionally high values. CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average $2.75 per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year, $1.16 per barrel lower than this year's first quarter average. * High sulfur No. 2 fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly, averaging $5.97 per barrel in November. Despite the drop of $0.37 per barrel from October's average, fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented values-$4.20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $3.46 per barrel greater that the previous five-year average. For the first quarter of 20001, CERA anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record high level of $4.75 per barrel in the first quarter.* Jet/kerosene differentials versus WTI rose $0.63 per barrel from the October average, reaching a whopping $8.59 per barrel in November. In correspondence with the distillate market, jet/kerosene margins are at historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight fundamentals. CERA expects jet/kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of $5.75 per barrel.* Margins for US Gulf Coast 1% sulfur residual fuel dropped by $2.15 per barrel, reaching $3.999 per barrel below WTI during November. Despite the recent widening of differentials, CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter months. Residual fuel differentials are expected to average $2.50 per barrel below WTI during the first quarter of next year, at the high end of the historical range.US Demand Highlights * Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) from the October level, reaching 8.36 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last year largely because Y2K concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago. CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder temperatures arrive, averaging 8.08 mbd during the first quarter of 20001.* Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3.94 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, over 7 percent greater than this time last year. This represents a slight increase of about 0.05 million barrels (mb) from the end-October level of 3.90 mb, but still a record high level for early December. With support from low home heating oil inventories, particularly in the Northeast, distillate demand has been very strong during the fall of 2000. CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter months, averaging 3.79 mb during the first quarter of next year. * Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the October level to reach 1.68 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite the decline, apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year-ago level. The relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals. CERA expects the demand for jet fuel to average 1.81 mb during the fourth quarter. * Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0.87 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, a decline of about 0.09 mbd from the October average and a slight increase over the November level. Demand for residual fuel is currently 111 percent greater than last year, and surging natural gas prices are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout the winter. Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0.85 to 0.9 mbd range during the first quarter of 20001.US Inventory Highlights * Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196.5 mb, increasing almost 10 mb from the end-October value. Responding to rising stock levels and declining apparent demand, forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 23.5 days for the four weeks ending December 8. Forward supply is 2.5 percent below last year's level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the past eight years-although CERA still believes coverage is currently sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter. However, CERA is looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year.* Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of October at 29.2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite record high apparent demand, strong refinery production levels helped boost primary distillate inventories slightly, to 1115.3 mb for this period. Primary stocks are 16 percent below last year's level at this time and at their lowest historical level ever. Although stocks are low, CERA does not anticipate shortages to occur this winter. Assuming normally cold weather, refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting demand requirements-albeit at a high price. * Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage, to reach 25.7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. This moves jet fuel coverage above the 23.5 to 25 days' supply range that it had been in for the past four months. The rise of just under 1 day in forward supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand. Jet inventories and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull from tight distillate markets strengthen, but supplies are expected to be adequate for the winter.* Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply from October, reaching 41.7 days of forward supply during the four weeks ending December 8. The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a drop in demand and an increase in stocks. With demand expected to strengthen because of colder weather and high gas prices, CERA looks for inventories and coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks. ***end*** This CERA Alert will be available in PDF format within 24 hours. *** This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information from Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA negotiations that could take about six months to finish.   Until the PPA is signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed with or without this specific turbine.   Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.   However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron   affiliate if there is a bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.If Delaney has a firm \"bird in the hand\" he should take the turbine.   Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want to take the turbine.My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.Rick   \n"

        " Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT on 10/10/2000 08:58 AM ---Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT10/08/2000 09:21 AMTo: Jeffrey A Shankman@ECTcc: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Clay Harris/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Selldown of MetgasThe partial sale of Enron India's 1000% interest in Metgas is on Cliff Baxter's list of corporate assets for sale.   As I expressed in our recent telephone conversation,   I view Metgas as a key asset that could be of great value to the EGM LNG network.   I believe that Enron should reconsider whether or not a Metgas selldown is a wise move at this time for the following reasons:   1.   The Dabhol LNG terminal is ideally located for future LNG arbitrage plays, i.e., halfway between middle east and far east LNG suppliers.   Opportunites for Mideast/Far East swaps or shipping backhauls could generate significant value for EGM.2.   Metgas currently holds exclusive rights to use Dabhol's LNG terminal for imports of LNG into India, and it will be at least several years (if ever) before a second LNG terminal is built in India.   We should not be giving this strategic position away.3.   The fact that our competitors (e.g., Petronas, BP, BG etc.) want to buy in is an indicator that we have something of value.   Even a partial selldown (and granting of voting rights) to one of these players could serously compromise our optionality and ability to maximize value to Enron. 4. I suspect that the market value of Metgas at this time (given that there is still significant developement risk) is fairly small relative to its network value to EGM.If, in spite of my arguments, a decison is made to sell down Metgas, there are two things that we could do to limit the damage:1.   Prior to the sale, sign an agreement between EGM and Metgas that provides EGM with exclusive rights to use the terminal, and2.   EGM should step into the Metgas/Malaysia LNG contract (i.e., EGM should buy from Malaysia and resell to Metgas) to ensure that we maintain maximum optionality in this contract.   We could do this in a way that gives us control of the contract but passes Metgas risk through EGM and back to Malaysia.I understand that the time fuse for this selldown is very short---immediate action is needed if you want a vote on this.Rick   \n"

Last week I went to see Canadian Steamship Lines. Prior to my visit I asked Vikas, the middle marketing associate, to contact Singapore and get quarterly offers for IFO 180. Vikas emailed Hans Wong three times.   He also called twice. I also asked   Sarah Mulholland to call Singapore on Friday prior to start of my meeting. She could not reach Hans either in the office or on his cell phone. We finally received some numbers Monday morning, obviously too late for our client meeting.I understand that you have been working very hard to increase responsiveness and market development for crude and products.   With this in mind, I   believe have a partial solution   that will prove beneficial to all. On the EGM fundamentals page I intend to include a section where the mids of all products will be posted based on the day's close. I think this would help everyone stay on top of the various markets and products around the world.Thanks for your attention to this matter.Jen---",

I initially put this together as a way of organizing my notes, as well as communicating the latest status to Mark Haedicke and Alan Aronowitz in EWS/EGM Legal, who have asked to be kept advised of developments affecting the LNG contracts.   However, in discussions during this morning's Dabhol project lawyers' call, the issue was raised whether any written record of the discussions would be sent on to the shiplenders or the Greenfield sponsors.   I offered to make this summary available to the group if it would be of any assistance, my offer was promptly accepted, and that's why you see all the \"cc\" names in the address line above. Of course, this summary is derived from my notes and somewhat contemporaneous recollections of the call, and as such I'm quite open to any suggested revisions to ensure the record is set as straight as possible.Kind regards,Dan\n"

National Accounts Part A - Bundled Service * This is the full bundled product (DSM, Commodity and Risk Mgmt) * Angela Swarz is the team lead *They are targetting large commercials (i.e shopping centers, hotels etc).   *They are also going aftersome large industrials (i.e. they closed Quaker Oats on 1/25) Part   B: Middle Marketing- - Industrial Origination * Mike Mann heads this up *They are targetting heavy industrials including the Refining, Petchem and Chemical industries * They sell Risk Mgmt, Commodity etc... * They are making a concerted effort on Ags and Chems * Approaching customer at the executive Level * Already approached Farmland and IMC * Have a deal with Kerr McGee for outsourcing 2. Fast Track \"Boiler Room\" *Run by Craig Sutter * ABC - always be closing--- They have written a script for originators to close a deal in 4 calls. *They have a computer that generates leads for their new marketing products ( \"ENvest\" (Asset capex), ENpower \"commodity swaps\", Commodity sales   \"ENsomething\" and \"Entelligence\" - 3.

This includes Refining, Petchems, Transport, Chemicals, Coal, Ags, etc...They a model \"Value Enhancement\" that   shows an itemized account of a customer's VAR by commodity (metals, plastics, petchems,products, gas, power, etc). They planon covering the whole universe of risk management. Obviously we need to manage the relationship with EES.Next Steps:Meet with Mike Mann. I have his target list. We probably need to see how we help them bring business to the EGM books, since they are cross-selling everything.Let me know what you want to do.JF\n"

        " Daniel Reck/HOU/ECT on 10/31/2000 04:07 PM ---Kevin Liss@ENRON10/31/2000 02:24 PMTo: Daniel Reck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tim Proffitt/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Stephen H Douglas/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: The Way ForwardDan, in response to your question yesterday, it should still be possible to get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank (DB) had contemplated.   In that respect, last week's IRS announcement leaves things unchanged.That's the good news.   However, in light of last week's IRS announcement, DB is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming Pacificorp's existing letter rulings, which they have told us was critical to them.   It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a non-starter from their perspective, at least based upon the present plan of operations.   Tim, is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their run-of-mine coal, consistently with their existing rulings?   I doubt it, but if not, we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to do a coal deal with Pacificorp.   I believe that Pacificorp still needs to unload their facilities, and they may still be able to leverage off of their existing rulings, which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS. Without a deal with DB, what are our options now?   First, it is important to recognize that we still have options.   The IRS has not killed synfuel.   There has not been any change in the substantive law.   Last week's announcement was just that --- an announcement of the IRS's point of view.   The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business, which has been an important source of comfort to many investors, but not necessarily vital.   Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having a private letter ruling from the IRS (generally in reliance on an opinion of outside counsel).   We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks like in the absence of getting a new ruling.One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorp's facilties, meaning we would relocate them, and continue running run-of-mine coal, the IRS be damned, and just find an equity player with a greater risk profile than Pacificorp.   In short, we would need companies who are willing to rely on Pacificorp's existing rulings, period (along with an appropriate indemnity).   It seems to me that if the price is right, someone ought to be willing to step up.   While the risk is now greater, the potential returns are potentially mind-blowing, and an equity player ought to be able to get an opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits, notwithstanding the IRS' current view of the law.   It seems to me that this is the only approach that makes sense.Alternatively, Pacificorp's facilities could revert back to being a pure coal fine processing facilities in an attempt to conform with the IRS's recent announcement.   The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that process \"waste coal fines,\" so such facilities could still qualify for new private letter rulings.   The IRS announcement defines the term \"waste coal fines\" very vaguely, not specifying either the coal size, or what it is that makes coal fines properly viewed as \"waste\" coal fines.   If you think in lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their announcement, I can envision that Enron could synthetically create \"waste\" coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility customers to provide for the sale of only coal of 3/4 inches or greater, resulting in a residual category of \"unwanted\" coal that we could separately market to synfuel plants as \"waste\" coal fines.   In other words, they could be fairly described as \"waste\" insofar as another coal customer specifically excluded it from their contract.   In addition, the IRS announcement does not require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output, as some commontators had feared, which is a helpful development because the pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity.   However, there are real difficulties with this approach.   First, the relevant language in the IRS announcement defining \"waste coal fines\" is not real statutory law.   It is basically just an IRS policy statement, meaning that we cannot bind the IRS to it.   So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the IRS's choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were statutory law.   Also, Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste fines is fines from true waste ponds.   Even if the taxpayer can argue over the meaning of the term \"waste\" fines, the IRS can stick to their understanding of the term, at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue a new ruling.   In short, the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly 3 or 4% waste fines incidental to mining operations.   If you are not going to be able to get a new ruling anyway, what's the point of going back to being a coal fine processing facility?But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach.   Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines generally (i.e., not merely \"waste\" coal fines) as well as run-of-mine coal.   Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more restrictive than the ones that they already have?   That is truly putting value at risk.   In my view, the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing rulings as essentially \"above market\" rulings, insofar as they go farther than the IRS currently allows, giving them a competitive advantage over other synfuel operators who never got a ruling.   It seems to me that if they can be persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape, since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk, then we may still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal.

Although imports are down from the peak in August, they still lie at least 5000 kb/d above recent years' levels.Bizarrely, the SPR rose by 0.5 mbbls last week, and 70kb/d of imports were specifically allocated to SPR - partly offsetting the 4.5 mbbl commercial stock draw.There is no sign yet of distillate demand slowing, rather it continues to climb, and is well into winter levels.Distillate output is strong, due to very high yields, rather than high throughput.What does this mean for stocks?The refinery runs show we are well into the maintenance season, and crude stocks almost always rise this time of year. But if the weather disruptions did not show up in last week's DOEs, they may appear tomorrow. DOE crude stocks are 2.5mbbls above API.With distillate demand still storming, and runs falling, we could be in for another week or two of distillate draws.As a result of the yield and the runs, gasoline stocks will likely follow the seasonal pattern and fall once more. DOE mogas stocks are 3.5 mbbls below API.The consensus appears to be for builds across the board, but some of these factors might argue otherwise. Some charts are attached illustrating the points.\n"

Meanwhile there remains to be South African resell tonnage coming our way - predominantly appearing by way of the Spanish utilities who continue to have excellent hydro levels and ourability to source South African Call Options on FOB RBCT level with strike of $32.50 seems to question the recent information that Billitonsold tonnage at $333.25 equivalent into European consumers for the rest of the year Furthermore for the first time this year we begin to see Colombian resell material appearing on the market both on a CIF and FOB basis - probably no coincidence that this comes at a time when some of the steam seems to have come off the U.S. spot market. Overall the tone seems to be firmer but with very few new fundamental inputs to fuel this but rather producer sentiment   After weeks of tentatively drifting south the SECA market traded up a dollar along the whole curve last week. This was really a consequence of a few looking to buy into a market void of sellers which was itself is directly a function of peoples unwillingness to further sponsor a market which has come down some $5 from it's high's. The spot market is now trading at $40.50 Fob barge Rotterdam, 2nd half of the year at $40.25 and then 20002 at $39.50.PACIFICDespite the extensive coverage which the Far East seems to be attracting with regards to economic slowdowns/weakness the Pacificmarket continues to be tight. The JSM/Producers continue their annual negotiations, but expect to see few conclusions from these in theshort term as the JSM's continue to exercise all the options they have to keep the drip feed going and most have clauses in their contractswhich allow them to carry on shipping material despite any agreement until September time. Both KEPCO and Lafarge have come out with tenders for the delivery of coal for prompt shipment - it is definitely a sign of progress that we are being invited to bid but without any length with which to play with, going short in front of Glencore and Rio could be expensive - the plan will be to participate without winning the business. The Chinese Annual Coal Fair took place over the last cuppla weeks where contracts for 20001 are negotiated and various sectors lobbyfor their allocation on infrastructure. The major takeaway's from the meeting were that total production is estimated at 950 million mt for 20001with exports targeted at 63 million mt - up 5 million mt from last year. Despite increased export targets, the sentiment remains bullish with most producers asking between $29 and $31 representing a $3/$4 increase versus 2000 prices. Strong domestic prices will limit any downside in the export market and while the government is keen to keep pushing exports there is a general   scepticism over the ability of the rail to move the projected tonnage. We have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with a producer based in Inner Mongolia (ZCIC)to market upto 1 million mt per year into the export market - all going well this will provide us with the necessary length to be able to target business in the region more aggressively.GAMEPLANWe continue to try and take advantage of this mismatch between the origin markets and the European market by selling out of origin lengthand using the resell market to pick up tonnage to service our commitments at destination. We are working several bits of long-term destinationbusiness in the Atlantic which if successful will serve as a melting pot for any length we have remaining in that basin and more. We will alsolook to sell into any further rally in the destination SECA mkt. Despite fundamentals in Asia pointing to a slowdown in demand the consolidation we are seeing in Australia will certainly prevent any collapse in prices and short-term expect prices to head higher than the $30 I wud call FOB Newcastle today. It will be very difficult for us to get any ammunition for the near-term but we are looking at various projects which will again give us access to coal further out in the curve and at the same time are exploring any opportunity to own some optionality to give us some protection against a continued squeeze further out in the curve.Best RegardsJez\n"

As a consequence spot/Q2 prices are nowtrading at $2 discount to replacement from South Africa ($40.75 FOB ARA versus $42.75 replacement) - a concept which many arestruggling to get their head round. The Lion's share of the resell mkt is South African which makes sense as the strong U.S. mkt has taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline. In truth, while the U.S. mkt has been steaming, only very limited incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U.S. as the Utilities only pay up for spot spot material. If the steep backwardisationin the U.S. rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that thestrong U.S domestic market will keep U.S. exports into Europe very low. PacificVery few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe over the last few months and this has been a function of the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to the consolidation which has been going on, the latest development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic slowdown.   At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is$3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle.GameplanWe are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We willcontinue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on pricesif the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading ourway which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sellout of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from theArmada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities whilethe mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering anything further forward.RgdsJez\n"

One reason the trend is likely to be repeated is that the SPR shipped 2.45 mbbls last week, and this should again show up in PADD 3, while the drop in PADD 5 stocks (led by a sharp drop in imports) which offset the PADD 3 rise last week is unlikely to occur a second week. Overall imports remain high, and additional October barrels might just have found their way to the US from its closer OPEC neghbours. On the other hand, we have the Capline shutdown (due to lack of crude) which took place last week, and an increase in refinery runs out of turnaround, but I don't believe that will offset the factors pointing to a large build in crude stocks. (Consensus forecast up 2.5 mbbls. API still lower than the DOE by 2.4 mbbls)Distillate: After rising steadily since mid July, demand finally turned south last week, with a 640 kbd drop. This is the first evidence that borrowed demand is now being paid back. A second week of stats would confirm this, but the weakening sentiment on cracks lends some support to the theory. The build last week occurred despite a strong drop in imports - providing demand stays low, higher runs and high distillate yields should see a build, perhaps in excess of 1 mbbls. (Consensus forecast up 1 mbbls)Mogas: Gasoline demand has been sluggish for most of the year, but October sales were relatively strong, especially last week, which topped 8.7 mbd (8.9 in the DOEs), not far off the year's highs. October deliveries are invariably higher than both Sep and Nov, so the most likely direction for demand is down. Imports from Canada and Europe are said to be on the way, but may take some time before they show up in the stats - although some improvement should be seen after last week's miserly 212 kbd which accounted for much of the draw. However, the gasoline tanker stuck in NYH may skew the stats. PADD 1 again bore the lion's share of last week's draw, bringing stocks down to their lowest level since at least 1976 - it has lost 7 mbbls in four weeks. For RFG too, the region is looking short. This week is hard to call, but may point to a build, on the basis that strong demand and weak imports aren't sustained. (Consensus forecast down 1.5 mbbls. API still higher than DOE by 2.6 mbbls.)Stocks graphs attached\n"

Wells is incredibly interested in the breadth of markets that Enron is currently involved in. My sense is that, with a mandate to grow their capital market reach, Wells will be looking to us as a potential strategic partner in taking many of our capabilities to their immense corporate client base.Based on my relationship with them, they have expressed special interest in EnronCredit. The form of this seems quite interesting. My sense is that they have explored building their own credit derivative capabilities and for various reasons feel that it may be more efficient/economical to build some sort of shared capabilities with our group --- I think that our focus on solutions for the corporate risk manager is attractive to them. In addition to this, their Chief Credit Officer will be joining on this date to explore our capabilities in assisting with management of the Bank's credit portfolio. Based on my discussions with them and my sense of their interest in exploring various types of working relationships with us, I would suggest that we have a senior presence at this meeting.This being said, they also have a great deal of interest in speaking to the Heads of all our other risk management/commodity desks. My hope is that Jeff Shankman will be available to discuss/introduce Enron Global Markets which would then be followed with product presentations from all desks interested (Mark Tawney has already agreed to presenting our Weather Derivative capabilities). Also, our Global Finance Group has expressed their interest in participating during these discussions. It has been indicated to me that the following people will be attending from Wells Fargo:TreasurerChief Credit OfficerSr. VP, &amp; Head of Product Development, Capital MarketsHead of Derivative SalesMy hope is to finalise an agenda by the end of the week. In order to accomplish this, I would like to discuss (as a group) the best format in which to present --- one which will ensure an accurate representation of our capabilities and of our interest in developing this relationship.Thanks,George3-7489\n"

Enron   has suspended work to close project financing and we have significantly reduced the MetGas staff.   The Team will focus on completing the acquisition of all major permits and clearances over the next few weeks.   The go forward plan is to either package MetGas \"as is\" and sell it off or use it as leverage in the negotiation of the DPC workout with the Indian government.   I will be relocating from India back to Houston   in the near future.   In anticipation of this relocation I am exploring possible job opportunities within the Enron family of companies.   I believe I can add value to your team's efforts in developing the LNG projects in both Venezuela and the Bahamas.   I have experience related to both projects and I can hit the ground running.   In addition, I bring prior ECT experience and success as a deal maker / originator, extensive experience in LNG including the development of production facilities, regasification and related harbour facilities and experience negotiating LNG Sale &amp; Purchase Agreements as both a buyer or seller. Coupled to this experience is my knowledge of what it takes to structure assets and the pertinent commercial documents such that the asset can be project financed.   I am confident I can be of help and add value to your Western hemisphere LNG Team.I would appreciate you taking the time to review my resume and keeping me in mind when looking to fill any current or future positions. Thanks...\n"

With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals that will sell themselves. -need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield attractive results. With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.   Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand prior.

Was signed by minister of oil Maher Jammal and minister of oil in Egypt Sameh Fahmi and the Lebanese side was attended by Muhammad Abdul hamid Beydoun, the minister of energy and waters, in the presence of the secretary general of the Syrian- Lebanese higher council Nasr al-Kouri.The project aims at transporting Egyptian and Syrian gas prepared for exportation to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and European countries to market it to meet the local demands of gas in these countries.In a statement to pressmen following the signing ceremony, the Egyptian minister said the pipeline worth US $ 1 billion and that it would start near al-Arish in Egypt in Northern Egypt and run under the waters of the Mediterranean to Lebanon and Turkey through Syria.The Syrian minister stressed the importance of the project which constitutes a turning point in boosting joint regional Arab co-operation and which signifies a vivid example on integrated Arab economy.For his part, the Lebanese minister said that this project will strengthen the economic potentials of the participating countries and have positive impact on their general conditions.Alhamd AlkhayatENRON CORP.+1(713)853-0315This message (including any attachments) contains confidential information intended for a specific individual and purpose, and is protected by law.

(the Plock ref people and the JNS people wud like to buy the thing but for political reasons cannot until about 5 years down the road.)   Therefore, we can structure our deal w/ a put option for a later date.We can view this as a long crack position, with an eventual put in place if/when we don't like the deal.There are other optionality benefits that need to be assessed.   (so far i have told them to count the trading angle as 0 profit, so that they don't load us up w/ a lot of bs).   We can use the facilities as a terminal.   We can just use the infrastructure to re-sell the crude that they get on the pipeline.   We can sell the ulsd they make and replace w/ regular diesel.   Given their power needs they have their own plant but are still short 3000 MW, so the power people like it.   etc etc.I have already told them that we did not really want to waste our time thinking about this project if the specter of a reuters headline blaring that 'Enron Buys Polish Refinery' is going to kill the deal from Skilling's perspective.   they assure me that they have run it by sheriff and he likes the power aspect and the higher profile this wud give us in poland so he is favorable towards it, for the moment.   rac will be looking for 20-25% roi, which may kill the whole thing anyway.   they have already gotten toxic waste indemnity from the govt.we need to ask questions/poke holes and get as much information as possible out of the govt and JNS, because either they will do the deal and throw this in our laps, or they might pass on something that wud actually turn out to be interesting.   if everybody wud please read the brief and come up w/ issues to be clarified by wednesday next week, i would appreciate it. thx   \n"

I don't believe we could have done this any other way or they would have folded already.any hedging we did on their behalf would have added further to our risk (we already had the shortfutures vs the strategic stocks) in an upmarket but cleary we need to consider this risk when weevaluate how quickly we are prepared to take the actions that will close down gmp...   \n"

I don't feel this will increase revenues for us in 20001 as our   efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin volume environment.   Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a significant recruitment and training effort.   Both the recruitment and the teaching process are ones that we need to focus on.   Please let me know what you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates.   I plan on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team that I'm assembling in London.   By end October, the London office will have 5 managers, 4 associates and 1 analyst in our group.   This is a real shift from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors.   Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside (about 333% success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron) I think this is the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus toward teaching. My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and analysis.   The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the consulting companies in London and I'm putting him in charge of drawing up a list of potential customers in every European country.   Please let me know if you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing business.   Can't help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future.   Having seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume.   This is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our system.   The challenge is how can we put up more volumes, more markets, and tighter 2 ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run over.   What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to have.   I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct 2nd with Koch, Dynergy, Entergy, Willams, and a few others.   Are we thinking about trying to join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have?   This is area that we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if we fail to be the largest in this platform.   I don't feel that in the oil business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers.   We are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the industry will look at two different e-trading sites.   BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS This has always received luke-warm interest from Enron.   I believe that the inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on thatalone.   So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physicalbusiness.   Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortestfinancial commitment.   Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor.   We cancandycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets.   We havea credit department that have done a poor job, if any at all, in getting out there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to participate with(petrobras, pertamina, petrolimex, sinochem, sinopec, egpc, nnpc) if we have any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes.   We are also theworst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we have a commitment to perform.   Our contracts are also drafted with many escape clauses that will be rejected by many end-users who will insist on a greater performance guarantee.   As we discussed briefly in Singapore, I think there are several airlines that we could target in the U.S. for physical supply.   I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential damages that the airlines have in their tenders.   Previously, I have not gone after this business because I didn't believe we would have the political clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such matters.   Please consider this (I will fax you a tender offer from Japan Airlines) and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars.   That kind of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline business.   I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go forward...this message was more to highlight how I'm trying to advance the group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment.   Lastly, on that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems that will make us better suited to do customer business.   At the moment everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying to get toward a server based systemand options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT people instead of traders.   I will let you know if we need any help from you on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT department.\n"

Yeah, du ... outside, standing like a&lt; putzel ... eh?\"&lt;&lt; Sherman rubbed his eyes and ears. Couldn't believe it. The proprietor&lt; sprang out of the door and grabbed Meyer by the sleeve. \"Come in&lt; here, fella, and check out this parrot!\"&lt;&lt; Sherman stood in front of an African Grey that cocked his little head&lt; and said: \"Vus? Kenst reddin Yiddish?\"&lt;&lt; Sherman said to the parrot, \"You speak Yiddish?\"&lt;&lt; The parrot replied, \"Vuh den? Chinese maybe?\"&lt;&lt; In a matter of moments, Sherman had placed five hundred dollars down&lt; on the counter and carried the parrot in his cage away with him.   All&lt; night he talked with the parrot.   In Yiddish.   He told the parrot&lt; about his father's adventures coming to America.   About how beautiful&lt; his mother was when she was a young bride.   About his family About&lt; his years of working in the garment center.   About Florida.&lt;&lt; The parrot listened and commented. They shared some walnuts. The&lt; parrot told him of living in the pet store, how he hated the&lt; weekends.   They both went to sleep.&lt;&lt; Next morning, Sherman began to put on his tfillin all the while,&lt; saying his prayers.   The parrot demanded to know what he was doing&lt; and when Sherman explained, the parrot wanted some too.   Sherman went&lt; out and hand-made a miniature set of tfillin for the parrot.&lt;&lt; The parrot wanted to learn to daven, and learned every prayer. He&lt; wanted to learn to read Hebrew so Sherman spent weeks and months,&lt; sitting and teaching the parrot, teaching him Torah.&lt;&lt; One morning, on Rosh Hashana, Sherman rose and got dressed and was&lt; about to leave when the parrot demanded to go with him.   Sherman&lt; explained that Shul was no place for a bird but the parrot made a&lt; terrific argument and was carried to Shul on Sherman's shoulder.&lt;&lt; Needless to say, they made quite a spectacle, and Sherman was&lt; questioned by everyone, including the Rabbi and Cantor.   They refused&lt; to allow a bird into the building on the High Holy Days but Sherman&lt; convinced them to let him in this one time, swearing that parrot&lt; could daven.&lt;&lt; Wagers were made with Sherman. Thousands of dollars were bet (even&lt; odds) that the parrot could NOT daven, could not speak Yiddish or&lt; Hebrew, etc.&lt;&lt; All eyes were on the African Grey during services. The parrot perched&lt; on Sherman's shoulder as one prayer and song passed - Sherman heard&lt; not a peep from the bird.   He began to become annoyed, slapping at&lt; his shoulder and mumbling under his breath, \"Daven!\"&lt;&lt; Nothing.&lt;&lt; \"Daven ... parrot, you can daven, so daven ... come on, everybody's&lt; looking at you!\"&lt;&lt; Nothing.&lt;&lt; After Rosh Hashanah services were concluded,   Sherman found that he&lt; owed his Shul buddies and the Rabbi over four thousand dollars.   He&lt; marched home, upset as hell, saying nothing.   Finally several blocks&lt; from the Temple the bird began to sing an old Yiddish song and was&lt; happy as a lark.   Sherman stopped and looked at him.&lt;&lt; \"You miserable bird, you cost me over four thousand dollars. Why?&lt; After I made your tfillin and taught you the morning prayers, and&lt; taught you to read Hebrew and the Torah.   And after you begged me to&lt; bring you to Shul on Rosh Hashana, why?   Why did you do this to me?\"&lt;&lt; \"Don't be a schmuck,\" the parrot replied. \"Think of the odds on YomKippur!\"&lt;\n"
