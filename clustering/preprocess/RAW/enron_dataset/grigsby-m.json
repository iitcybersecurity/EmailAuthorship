You will need to add this demand to the EOC S ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).   We should use the 2000 waha west volumes for now.   You should end up with reduced ehrenberg volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the addition of New Gen demand.   Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.   We will then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 20001.   Also, add columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.   We should then look to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased NW imports to CA scenario that could happen.   Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.   I would like to avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand. Use a 10,000 heat rate to reduce gas demand.   Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.   We may have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.   We will then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes between now and next summer - run the 20001 with this possibility as well.   Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.   Let me know where my errors in approach may be.This should give us a picture of the Socal deliverability for 20001.Thanks,Mike   \n"

Technology has helped Enron create new=20\rbusinesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20\rresponsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.   You=\r=01,ve=20\rseen what technology can do at work.   Now we want you and your family to=20\rrealize its benefits at home.\r With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\rhe=20\rClickAtHome\rprogram, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20\rtechnology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=\r=20\rclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\r=20\rInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\r We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\r=20\rthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\r=20\rcase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\r=20\rcomputer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20\rClickAtHome includes the following:\r ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=\r=20\rdisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\r=20\rsoftware. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\r=20\rconnection, including broadband, where commercially available.\r? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\r=20\rand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\r=20\rhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\r,=20\rEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\raccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.   Eligibility includes being=20\remployed at the time of implementation. =20\r? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 20001, with delivery of=\r=20\rthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.   Delive=\rry=20\rof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 20001.\r Details about this program are still being finalized.   To address some of=\r=20\ryour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\r=20\rhttp:///clickathome.enron.com.   We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=\rar=20\rfuture where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20\rsubmit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20\r We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20\rfamily.   We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=\rl=20\rby creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=\r=20\rthe broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=\r=20\rEnron is a great place to work.\r\n"

I would like to continue to use the physical for large prompt positions going forward.   I am afraid that the baseload volumes may not continue on their current trend if we break out the books.   We need to discuss how the cash books would lay off risk.   i.e. Intra regional spreads with GD swap legs or spreads with other cash points and then booking out at gd mid to the internal counterparty.   Janie managing SJ and laying off risk on Steve's Opal.   I know that the cash books would be a good idea for dailies , but I am not sure how to do this without giving up the cash risk for baseload as well.   What are your thoughts?I would also like to discuss the staffing issues.   Matt Smith and Susan Scott to analyst,   Jay to the ROX, etc.   It seems like Ken S. has shown more interest in the west fundies lately.   Should we keep his services?The basis products need another book.   Who can we add to the mix?   I think that we should look into having Frank focus on prompt month only.   He has a great interest in cash and fundies and this should serve him well in managing tight two ways for all products on the prompt.   Keith can do term with another book.Monique is going to take over the gd swaps for Kern, SJ, and Perm.   I will continue to manage the CA products.   This should allow us to provide tighter two ways across the west. I will continue to manage all index products and prompt month phys fixed price.Operations needs more labor as well as an analyst or two to monitor flows.   The analysts will monitor flows by price and hopefully find creative ways to nom the market.EOL.   Keith has a great idea of opening up all products to the desk so that you may insert a bid or an offer inside of the manager's markets.   We should propose this to EOL.   This would allow for tighter markets on all products and prevent the desk from working markets through the brokers.Ca cash products.   Let's call a meeting about how to offer more Socal physical products.   I would like to have PG&amp;E topock and Socal Ehrenberg before the summer.   Mike\n"

      "body": "\nDear John,I had a meeting with Phillip after our morning discussion about P&amp;L and it seems that there may be some issues regarding how I run my book.   It was my mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were booked properly.   The options were booked properly by Larry May and my Book runners and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the options were not in my position.   Also, the tolls curves are not treated as schedule C.   I will adjust the tolls curves to account for basis curveshift as needed.   My P&amp;L did not match the Socal position because of physical index curveshift and an adjustment to transport.   The discussion and feedback from Phillip regarding your conversation with him concerns me.   I am confident that I run the most accurate physical and financial trading book within Enron.   I will stand on the fact that no one within the market has a better understanding of his/her position better than I.   The physical/financial risk in my book is managed to a standard not seen at Enron since I have been here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go to to manage the risk in the IM West trading book.   I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it is responsible for communicating with you directly.   Let's get together and discuss exactly what my responsibilities to you will be going forward.   It may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Phillip Allen up until this point.   This may have contributed to my miscommunication with you.   I will see that this will not happen in the future.   Thank you for all of my added responsibilities.Sincerely,Mike Grigsby\n"

When I tried to log in to CORP I got an error that no domain server was able to validate my password.   I went in and released the IP but got an error when trying to renew.   I verified that the card was installed correctly and that network properties were correct.   I then plugged straight into DSL and bypassed the Nortel box thinking that I could at least get that to work and then VPN into Enron.   That also did not work.   I spoke to SWB tech support for almost an hour trying some various things but was unsuccessful in those as well.   I also spoke to Mark Scott via telephone.I was unable to ping the gateway...nor anything for that matter which led me to believe that there was something wrong with the line.   SWB said they were going to do some line testing from their end and would get back with Mike.   At this point I would recommend sending someone out from Mark Scott's team that is more familiar with these setups than I am.   I do think it would be a good idea from someone from TSG to accompany them if they are able to arrange a time and then disseminate that information to the rest of the team.   Regards,KG\n"

Steve and Matt have started a pilot program in the NW for rolling out their next day cash products after 111:000 am each day.   We will look into rolling out the SW in the future.We are in the process of sending out the \"odd lot\" notice to our customers regarding all products on eol.   We will change our product minimum to one mmbtu in the next week.   You may want to discuss this with your direct customers before the mailout.

If you review your customer contact sheet and discover an old customer that we haven't contacted in some time, then call them and visit.

I would like to show the transport on EPNG value as SJ plus cost to Mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any.   The risk is showing the value of SJ to Socal topock (currently wide spreads for 20001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to Mojave topock.Sincerely,Mike\n"

We should also get back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.   Let's start testing the market, find the support and resistance each day.   It would be nice to have EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go through the product properties.   I'll call them tomorrow.Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.   We want to send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and nom.   I want to begin trading the next day cash by 111:01 am every day.   This would stay active until 4:000.The push is for PHYSICAL.   Our edge over the market will be phys.   From risk to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso flows?

Let's start testing the market, find the support and resistance each day.   It would be nice to have EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go through the product properties.   I'll call them tomorrow.Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.   We want to send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and nom.   I want to begin trading the next day cash by 111:01 am every day.   This would stay active until 4:000.The push is for PHYSICAL.   Our edge over the market will be phys.   From risk to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso flows?   If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.   It all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old economy.   The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, all benefit under the new mantra.Mike \n"

Where can we find a detailed summary of the gas cost mechanism?   Are we confident that it is an average of all border points into CA?   If the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator, then what happens if this genertor can only buy Socal daily gas?   This avergae CA gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators, since the spread between Malin and Socal has reached $7.000 at times.Thank you,Mike Grigsby\n"

Gray Davis' energy speechThe Associated Press   , , --- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televisedspeech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:   \"Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the mostdifficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.   \"Simply stated, we have two problems: supply is too low and costs are toohigh. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 19996. Butno matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. Andthat's what I'm doing.   \"The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must alsocut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't falland supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than weconsume.   \"Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plantwas built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing thiswithout weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.   \"Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their powerplants to independent generating companies. The generators are free tocharge whatever they want because they're governed only by federalregulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.   \"This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through theroof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.   \"In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, Californiastepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford tobuy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep thepower on and the economy strong. That's not all:   --- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lowerprices.   --- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contractsthe utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.   --- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.   --- We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction ofpower plants.   --- We're launching an $8000 million conservation program.   --- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power.If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs,we'll build them ourselves.   --- And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping usoff, we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegalconduct.   \"We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making realprogress.   \"Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates.It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gasprices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack ofsupply, that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and oureconomy strong.   \"But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massiverate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a planthat will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve andmotivate the biggest users to cut back.   \"Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more. For therest, the average increase will be 26 1/2 percent. For many of that group,rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users will see theirrates rise 34 1/2 percent on average. That includes business paying theirshare. This is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we've all beenpaying since last winter.   \"But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation.   \"Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay. The more youconserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weaponagainst blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your power, you'll helpsecure our energy future.   \"Unlike the PUC, my plan includes funds to restore the utilities tofinancial stability --- if they agree to three main conditions:   \"They must provide low-cost regulated power to the state for 10 years.Agree to sell us their transmission system. And dismiss their lawsuitsseeking to double your electricity rates.   \"My proposal raises rates fairly, assures us of long-term power,stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation.   \"Our emphasis on conservation is critical. In order to make it through thesummer, we must cut demand by at least 10 percent.   \"Already we've launched programs to cut back commercial lighting, andreduce consumption in office buildings, schools and government facilities.   \"Friends, we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless. We are34 million strong and if each of us does our part, we can minimizedisruptions and get through the summer. We are Californians. We'vewithstood earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.   \"Yes, this mess is man-made, but with your help and God's blessing, we'llget through this as well.   \"Thank you and good night.\"---Copyright 20001 AP\n"

      "body": "\nDear Tom, Enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to discuss listing other index points at the Socal border.   I think the market requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with respect to transportation constraints.   The market has clearly seen a divergence in the summer spreads between PG&amp;E and Socal interconnects.   The marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summer has proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas during these months.   Because of this, supply being transported from the Southwest supply basins can only find a home going into PG&amp;E.   This places downward pressure on PG&amp;E Topock gas and upward pressure on Socal Topock gas.   Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's interconnects.   Demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.   There is also a divergence between Ehrenberg and Topock because of liquidity.   Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport contracts on EPNG and downstream buying patterns of certain Socal markets. The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.   The overwhelming demand pressure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.   Although Ehrenberg is the marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.   The Socal Ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.   Ehrenberg simply gets placed at \"market prices\" because of varying objectives.   One transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller buyers on Socal may not approach this transporter for supplies.   This illiquidity has led to a spread existing between Topock and Ehrenberg. Picture   the market, San Juan gas is trading well below the Permian and Waha basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west.   Because of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on EPNG and TW wants to fill their contracts with San Juan gas first.   These molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnect. Likewise, all Buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery interconnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on the SJ east leg of EPNG.   This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas going into Plains North and allows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on the EPNG south mainline.   While the Socal market peaks in the summer, so does the EOC demand.   Permian west (Keystone West meter)   cannot satisfy both the EOC demand and the Socal demand.   So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south mainline.   This tells the entire story.   When demand exceeds all available historical supply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meet Ehrenberg demand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any correlation that may have existed between the supply basins and the market area.   When Keystone West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.   There is simply no available capacity at the Keystone West meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.   If you asked the market what the maximum interconnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not know.   This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are above historical levels.   It is like Al Gore blaming \"big oil companies\" for the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity.   There simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.   The supply exists, but there isn't enough refining capacity available to meet demand.   Fundamentals rule the market in all cases.I would like to propose the following index points for the Southern California border.   The market would   be better served with supply being included in these index points.   One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Three, KRS/Wheeler Ridge.   The market will be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in the future.

      "body": "\nGood morning.   With the energy crisis in California at this time, we will need to be extra careful with nominations at Socal and throughout the west to ensure that we continue to provide the excellent nomination service that we have been providing to our customers.   You guys are doing an excellent job and we understand that you are under quite a bit of pressure with limited staff.   Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of   pipeline allocations 12 hours in advance.   We all know that this can be almost impossible on EPNG, but because of the current price levels at Socal and the basins, Enron needs to call each customer and notify them of their cuts with an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential penalties.   We also need to document when the call was made.   In regards to the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron will be requesting full pipeline summaries of the nominations from our counterparties.   Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take place at these historical levels.   We need to remember that our counterparties may not act as they have in the past due to the market price implications on their P&amp;L.   We should not rely on prior business conduct in regards to \"standard epng allocations\" when dealing with our customers.   I would expect that the market is going to overreact to any cuts that may be above the \"pipeline average\".Let's discuss how we are going to monitor the flows of nominations out of our control.   How do we prevent collusion with respect to the socal nominations that we can't see?   Are there package numbers on each baseload contract to ensure that they don't simply reshuffle gas according to price? Let me know which companies are not providing Enron with timely allocation reports at Socal and I will call their senior trader to discuss getting this operational information sooner.Sincerely,Mike   \n"

They have been penalizing Enron for cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.   This was news to me.   Can you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact business with our customers in the west?I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west desk for some time.

I would like her to keep track of New Current day and all new deals that flow through the desk.   She can coordinate tickets to your group and make sure that they get booked throughout the day.   She can also put physical deals in Sitara.   Let me know what the desktop PC will need to be loaded with.   Start thinking of other tasks that she might be able to accomplish so that your group may get home at an earlier time each day.   You can keep this desk for your own use and rotate people through as needed.Thanks,Mike\n"
