I recently joined the Enron Corp. legal staff from Enron International legal.   My role in this project is to coordinate the international legal support for the new option plan.   As such, I have contacted lawyers in various international business units to work with local counsel in each of the countries in which Enron has employees who will participate in the plan, to ensure that the plan does not run afoul of any legal restrictions.   Based on current information (which is likely to change between now and December, per Melissa Laing), the relevant countries in the Enron Europe group are Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.   In the attachment labeled \"asiapac\" at the end of Jana Domke's message, you will find spreadsheets for all five of the Enron Europe companies.   Please review (with local counsel, if necessary) the information in the \"Legal Compliance\" section of each spreadsheet to confirm that the information therein is accurate.   Please forward any changes or comments to me and Jana Domke (Jana has requested that the review be complete by June 23rd).   The Public Relations department is currently preparing the written material that will communicate the details of the plan to the participating employees.   When that is available, I will send it to you so that you may make any modifications that are necessary to comply with local laws in each of the Enron Europe countries.   The communication documents will be available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Greek.   Please call me at 713-853-5698 with any questions.   Thank you for your assistance!Kelly---",

In most instances, the plan design replicates the prior Plan parameters.   However, on an international basis, there have been numerous regulatory and legislative changes which may impact this program.Attached are individual Country Summary Highlights which consolidate the various accounting/tax/legal/banking/human resource, etc. details and issues into one document.   This consolidated document is based not only on information gleaned from the previous AESOP inplementation, but it also reflects the most recent local tax changes - at least based upon the information we have here.Because successful Plan implementation and rollout is predicated upon solid information, understanding and interpretation, we need your assistance.   Please coordinate review of the your appropriate country documents with your local financial, legal, tax and/or other professionals, as required.   We want to ensure that AESOP incents our employees and reinforces the \"One ENRON\" philosophy - but at the same time, we need to ensure this program is cost effective, tax efficient, legally defensible and culturally acceptable in your areas of responsibility. Please document any specific issues and/or concerns, and where appropriate, provide input on viable options, corrective action, etc... Also, if you have plans to be in other foreign locations prior to AESOP implementation and they need to be included, please advise ASAP.   Please send your responses via e-mail to either Dung Huynh or myself or by fax to (713) 646-7203.   If you have questions or if you need to discuss further, please call me @ (713) 345-6142.   Our timeline is tight so would appreciate your responses at the latest by June 23rd - earlier if possible.   Once we have the input, we'll roll this information up into a revised Summary Document, identifying issues that need further assessment/discussion and move forward to coordiinate final resolution with the AESOP team members.Appreciate your assistance!Regards/Jana Domke &amp; Dung HuynhPS - I apologize ahead of time for not getting all the countries correctly sorted by region.

Stock option grants were made under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.   The grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/000 or a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.   A replacement program for beyond the year 2000 is under consideration and will likely be reviewed at the May, 2000 Board meeting.   If approved, this could result in stock option award grants to eligible employees.   Program awards are subject to and effective upon the approval by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.   Such stock awards shall be made pursuant to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as determined by the Committee.   The exercise price for grants of stock options shall be determined according to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which the award is granted.   This program may or may not be offered in certain domestic and international locations based upon management discretion and/or local labor and employment laws. \n"

The code that they are currently using is PXU for processing payroll.   These employees are paid bi-weekly.2.

Aside from other legalissues, one single issue that has received a lot of attention in recent yearsis the issue addressed by the Microsoft case involving the question underwhat circumstances are individuals designated as independent contractorsentitled to employee benefits provided by   an employer to its employees.While we have amended the various employee benefit plans to address thisissue, another place where it can be effectively addressed is in the contractfor services.Recently, I was involved with a project to develop provisions to be includedin such a service agreement with non-employee contractors who will not beentitled to employee benefits.   I thought you might have an interest in this,so I have attached the contract provisions that were developed for thiscircumstance along with an analysis.I wonder if there are other attorneys who design and draft such agreementswho would be interested in receiving this information?Regards,Pat - Benefit Waiver 1.doc\n"

The Seller is providing a limited indemnity for Purchaser's actions in selecting those employees.   The indemnity expressly excludes claims against ENA for the selection of those employees.   This indemnity thus excludes claims for discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, religion, etc.   The indemnity exclusion also could be interpreted to exclude claims for tortious interference.Thus, if ENA is going to exercise its right to select Company employees under that provision, ENA will assume the risk of claims by affected employees.   I can assist   you in identifying legal risks in the selection process and determining methods to manage the risks of those claims.Let me know if you would like to discuss this issue.Michelle Cashx3-6401\n"

The topic is technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.   In this 4th edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own time.   However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the book.   She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary information, however.What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?   She is willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not think that would be worthwhile.   My opinion at this point is that she can do it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific   information.

        " Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT on 12/12/2000 111:18 AM ---Michelle Cash12/06/2000 05:02 PMTo: Sharon Butcher/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mark Holsworth/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Code of Ethics/Copyright QuestionHello!An ENA employee wrote a book that was published in Russia.   There have been three editions, and the publisher wants her to do a 4th.   The topic is technical analysis, which is what she does here at Enron.   In this 4th edition, she will be using public data, her own PC, and working on her own time.   However, given that she has been at Enron for 6 months, she obviously would apply some of the knowledge she has gained here in the revision of the book.   She would not divulge any Enron confidential or proprietary information, however.What are your thoughts on whether she could be able to do this?   She is willing to let Enron be a co-author, although as a practical matter, I do not think that would be worthwhile.   My opinion at this point is that she can do it, so long as it is on her own time and using her own resources, and, of course, provided that she reveals no Enron-specific   information.   I welcome your perspective, however, given that this is a new one to me.Thanks for your thoughts.Michelle\n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nAnne,I have reviewed the P&amp;S Agreement for Triple Lutz.   From my perspective, it generally looks fine.   I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.In Section 4.7&amp;copy;(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.   I believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds $250K.   We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the provisions of Section 4.13(ii).Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not required by law.   However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key personnel to stay with the company through closing.   This may be done with the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.   Section 6.2(e) contains a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any employment contracts.   We do not renew employment contracts at a single time, and the contracts of key personnel may expire.   Do we want to tie our hands and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?   Section 6.2(l) also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.In Section 4.10, the wording \"(other than Environmental Laws)\" suggests that we are not in compliance with environmental laws.   Rephrasing that sentence to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.In Section 4.111(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind to customers.   I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host client development outings (e.g. Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.) and provide Enron goodies to people all the time.   Perhaps a limitation on de minimus gifts would be more accurate.   Also, a reference to our Code of Ethics may work here.In Section 4.13(a)(ii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value, or does it include equity grants that vest over time?   A reference to \"cash\" payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock options/restricted stock that vest over time.In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates vesting --- Pat, do you know?Should Section 7.3 be italicized?   I have not seen the latest of the Employee Matters Agreement.Have the parties discussed arbitration in lieu of litigation in Texas for the purposes of dispute resolution?Anne, let me know if these comments need clarification or if you have any other questions.Michelle\n"

The terms of that Agreement would include:1. He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel regarding litigation matters.   He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as needed.2. Through February 1, 20001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement).   After Feb.1, 20001, he will be paid a rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.3. Enron would agree to indemnify Kevin for his conduct taken in the ordinary course and scope of his employment with Enron, up to the last date of his employment with Enron.   Excluded from this indemnity would be allegations or claims based upon the following:   --- any conduct that is outside the course and scope of Kevin's employment,   --- any conduct violating policies of Enron or ENA,   --- Kevin's intentional acts,   --- Kevin's gross negligence,   --- Kevin's reckless conduct,   --- conduct that is in violation of any law, statute, regulation, or other legal obligation, or   --- the commission of an unlawful or illegal act.4. Kevin would invoice Enron for time spent in performing the services after 2/1/01.   The invoice would be paid within 30 days of receipt.   In addition, all related expenses would be reimbursed throughout the term of   the agreement.Let me know if you have any questions or require additional information.

We are obligated under the confidentiality agreement that Enron has signed to keep all information provided to us confidential and to return all information, including any reproductions, at the end of this process. Therefore, I ask that where possible you minimize photocopying (we have EB2943 set aside for our exclusive use) and let me know what photocopies you have made.Based on the management presentations and other information available we have changed the scope for our potential acquisition of the GP assets. We will: Proceed with the Leaf River mill with the expectation of submitting a binding bid Perform some additional due diligence to determine whether we should further pursue the Woodland mill, andNot pursue the Brunswick mill.Given the altered scope no work is required in evaluating Brunswick. By Oct. 1st we will decide whether to submit a bid for Woodland. GP still requires that binding bids be submitted by mid-November and this date will apply to both Leaf River and Woodland. Regardless of the delayed decision with respect to Woodland we have little time to understand the issues/risks and to conclude on the impact on whether Enron would want to own these assets and at what cost. We want your feedback as soon as possible so that we can incorporate that information into the internal management approval process and consequently the bid(s) that we will be submitting. Our current schedule has the management approval process beginning on November 9th.If you have any questions, please contact me.Craig\n"

Deferral Plan\r   Michelle, Carol Jewett called me this morning about including a provision i=\rn\rthe long term incentive plan (\"LTIP\") being established for Enron Investmen=\rt\rPartners (old Enron Development Corp.) to permit deferral of payouts under\rthe Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.\r I suggested to Carol that such a provision in the LTIP would not be\rappropriate or sufficient; that the tail cannot wag the dog.   If such\rdeferrals are to be permitted, they would have to be authorized and made\runder the provisions of the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.   Also, there are som=\re\radditional issues discussed below.\r Any compensatory arrangement that by design or practice defers payment of t=\rhe\rbenefit until or beyond termination of an employee=01,s employment is consi=\rdered\rto be a \"pension plan\" under ERISA.\r ERISA contains complex and challenging administrative, participation and\rfunding requirements   (which most employers want to avoid) for such non-tax\rqualified pension plans.   The way to avoid these requirements is to design\rsuch a compensatory program, such as a deferral plan, so that it is a \"top\rhat\" plan which is exempt, not from ERISA, but from the more onerous\rrequirements.\r For example, only employees who meet the \"top hat\" definition are permitted\rto participate in the Enron Corp. Deferral Plan.   Enron Corp. is not willin=\rg\rto let all employees who participate in the LTIP make deferrals to the Enro=\rn\rCorp. Deferral Plan.   Any participant in the LTIP who wants to defer a payo=\rut\rmust first pass the screening test for top hat employees applied by Enron\rCorp. Compensation and then make the deferral election on an approved form.\rAlso, any such employee must become an employee of Enron Corp. and then\rreassigned or seconded to work for Enron Investment Partners.   This\remployment requirement is to avoid multiple employer problems related to th=\re\rEnron Corp. Deferral Plan and its related trust.\r Michelle, it may be \"better, faster, simpler\" to include a deferral feature\rin the LTIP.   The same ERISA issues are present, but Enron Investment\rPartners is in control.\r Regardless, let=01,s discuss the design for the deferrals at your convenien=\rce.\r   Pat\r \n"

I never make a meeting, but really enjoy the tickets, etc.One question I have is whether Enron has any special relationships with Disney.   Are we a corporate client of Disney?

I have not heard from Marty Christian (spelling?)about training but will be glad to talk to her about scheduling.   Regardingthe cost, the price I quoted before was $15000 for half day, and $25000 for awhole day.   The actors are $1000 apiece per presentation ($3000 total for eachpresentation). Typically, I can do three sessions in a half day and five ina whole day.   Thus, total cost with the actors for a half day would be $24000and $4000 for a whole day.   One issue with the actors is that they do showsin the morning at their theater so afternoons usually are better for them.I know they have some Fridays in November in which they are open full days.Kerry E NotestineLittler Mendelson, PC19000 Chevron Tower1301 McKinney StreetHouston, Texas 777010713.652.4748713.951.9212 (fax)knotestine@littler.comww.littler.com---This email may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient(s).

These are separate activity sets which are closely related.   We have \"joined\" these activity set due to commonality of the PRC and Bonus with Enron, and to ensure that you have an adequate workload for your project period.   As part of this project initialization, you need to:Determine the Objectives (set with Kathy Schultea, any other individual(s) she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and Bob Sparger)List Activities/TasksSet Timelines with Key DatesSet Deliverables and TargetsEstablish Status ReportingThe primary focus is on the   PRC Historical Information set.   It is very important that you determine the data sources early on in your project to see how you might run all activities in parallel.   If this is not possible, you will need to communicate what the issues may be.The first step is to schedule a meeting with Kathy Schultea, any other individual(s) she may indicate as being key to the processes at hand, and me to go through the list above and begin to setup the various components to meet the needs of the future staffing teams in the BUs. As part of our toolkit, Project Status Report sheets follow.We need to setup the project status reporting ASAP. Upon completion of the project initialization steps, we will meet to discuss the performance evaluation process for your project.   Your evaluation will be based on several criteria related to the project and your individual performance.   Key items that are part of this process include:Handling of the project initialization stage (includes project planning and setup);Overall quality of the project deliverables (includes work products and documentation accuracy and clarity);The quantity of the overall project work effort (based on volume of the effort targeted and completion);Project management and communication (based on timeliness, accuracy, and communication);Feedback from the project customer base (based on teaming, communication, responsiveness, and initiative); andOther criteria (to be agreed, as appropriate).The vehicle for evaluation will be the standard PEP form and criteria as used in the PRC process.   The items listed above are measurable against the specific skills/behaviors that Enron uses in performance evaluation.   Following are the forms and criteria which will be used in the evaluation process.If you have any questions or concerns, please call me at ext. 31858.Regards,Bob\n"

Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some has been effective.   It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an agreement.   This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which vendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which we treat different vendors.   I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide and conquer approach. 2.   The agreements need to be updated.   I know that there are some reasons for using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR PROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could be worked out.   It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is some duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., all things that could be fixed rather easily. 3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover all kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.4.   If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an arrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement but the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for anything that they might do on the PWD. I realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what it is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view it with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking a methodology that has served us.Thanks.   gene   \n"

Taking the agreements in the name of Enron Corp. while irksome to some has been effective.   It allows any/all commercial companies to reference an agreement.   This provides for consistency not only in the manner in which vendors treat different operating companies but also in the manner in which we treat different vendors.   I think it keeps vendors from employing a divide and conquer approach. 2.   The agreements need to be updated.   I know that there are some reasons for using two agreements, i.e., MASTER SERVICE AGREEMENT and AGREEMENT FOR PROJECT SERVICES, but I would vote for combining them if the problems could be worked out.   It's not that the current agreements are bad but there is some duplication, terms that are confusing, clauses that are missing, etc., all things that could be fixed rather easily. 3.   I don't see why the agreements couldn't be generalized somewhat to cover all kinds of professional services as opposed to just IT consulting.4.   If commercial companies need/want to sign PWD's, why can't we work out an arrangement wherein the PWD is still subject to a Corporate master agreement but the commercial company signs and indemnifies the corporation, e.g., for anything that they might do on the PWD. I realize that nobody has asked me and maybe I don't really understand what it is that you are trying to accomplish in the modified processbut as I view it with from an overall Enron Corp., I am concerned that we might be chunking a methodology that has served us.Thanks.   gene   \n"

This might be appropriate for a member of the Executive Committee. Let me go into some more detail on the above.Point #2All of Senior Management has told outside constituents (The Board, Shareholders, Investment Analysts, Rating Agencies, Regulatory Agencies, Banks and Counterparties) that the RAC Group is independent of the Business Units.   That is, given that our job is to provide objective analysis of the business activities, it has provided great comfort to these interested parties that our judgment is not influenced by the people who are taking risk on behalf of the firm.   Individual compensation is the foundation of this independence.   These parties have made judgments to provide capital (dollar or otherwise) to us based on the knowledge that this group in this independent configuration exists and is effective.   It has been specifically cited in reports as a strength and we are asked to make dozens of presentations each year to that effect.   This is especially true in the Market Risk function because, unlike other transactions in the firm, there is no analysis and approval chain for risk taking other than coarse buckets and the valuation, direction, and volatility are so opaque.   Independence is a cornerstone of the G-30 recommendations on derivatives.   I believe that these parties are much more concerned with what they can't see as opposed to what they can. I believe that our claim to have an independent function would be jeopardized if my bonus were a function of earnings targets and a PRC full of trading MD's.This should be a simple guaranteed minimum.   Point #3If Enron wants the right to keep me on the shelf for up to 12 months, then Enron needs to pay for it.   While I understand that sign on bonuses and retention bonuses are discouraged, I have firm evidence that low level commercial people are receiving both without any senior management approval.   The amount should approximate the market price for the job (all in) for the period of the non-compete.   This follows to point #4 - I don't expect anyone to pay me such additional amounts equal to my \"target\" compensation for 12 months ($5000,000!!!).   The right answer is to shorten the non-compete to a maximum of 6 months and pay me for that.   I think that it would be equally stupid for Enron to not have the right to put me on the shelf for a considerable period of time given that I have and must continue to have complete access to all positions, p&amp;l and the underlying contracts.   I would consider giving Enron the option (for a smaller premium) to have me non-compete which, if exercised, would trigger a larger payment.There are some other smaller points that I have discussed with Sheila Walton which can be addressed later.Please give your consideration to these items asap as I my old contract has expired.Ted\n"

I am especially proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.   I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated.   We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.   Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year.   Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization --- S.J. Bashen Corporation --- to survey our organization; to \"take its pulse\" if you will; to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the \"necessary tools\" and breaking down any \"barriers.\"   SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.   SJBC will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.   This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.   Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input.   Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC consultant.   Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent.   Of course, given the size of our group, it will not be possible to meet with each of you.   Therefore, if you have not received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.Communication is one of Enron's core values.   I want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success.   Please be candid.   Thank you.Sally \n"

Except Utah, which&lt; she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP&lt; for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a&lt; world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without&lt; the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be&lt; disbanded.&lt;&lt; A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of&lt; you noticed.&lt;&lt; To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following&lt; rules are introduced with immediate effect:&lt; 1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary.&lt; Then look up \"aluminium\" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be&lt; amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you&lt; should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.   Look up&lt; \"vocabulary\". Using the same&lt; twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and&lt; \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.&lt; Look up \"interspersed\" .&lt;&lt; 2. There is no such thing as \"US English\" . We will let Microsoft know&lt; on your behalf.&lt;&lt; 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.&lt; It really isn't that hard.&lt;&lt; 4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the&lt; good guys.&lt;&lt; 5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen,&lt; but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get&lt; confused and give up half way through.&lt;&lt; 6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of&lt; football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good&lt; game.   The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your&lt; borders may have noticed that no one else plays American\" football. You&lt; will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper&lt; football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It&lt; is a difficult game.&lt;&lt; Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which&lt; is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a&lt; rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like&lt; nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side&lt; by 20005.&lt;&lt; 7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if&lt; they give you any merde. The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there&lt; is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky. The&lt; Russians have never been the bad guys. Merde is French for \"shit\".&lt;&lt; 8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday. November 8th will be a new&lt; national holiday, but only in England. It will be called Indecisive Day.&lt;&lt; 9. All American cars are hereby banned. They are crap and it is for your&lt; own good. When we show you German cars, you will understand what we&lt; mean.&lt;&lt; 10. Please tell us who killed JFK. It's been driving us crazy.&lt;&lt; Thank you for your cooperation.&lt;\n"

Shift differentials andother adjustments for working particular hours or on particular tasks areincluded in the regular rate of pay.   If, as set forth in the e-mailforwarded to me from Kerry, an employee is paid a shift differential fornight shift work, that differential becomes part of the regular rate of payfor the night shift work.   If the same employee rotates between day andnight shifts, she/he will be working at two different rates of pay.   This isacceptable but poses special issues for the calculation of overtime.Federal law permits two methods of calculating overtime for employees whowork at two (or more) different regular rates of pay.   Employers may useeither a weighted average (29CFR 7778.1115) or a rate-in-effect (29CFR7778.419) calculation.l. Weighted Average CalculationThis calculation involves add multiplying the number of hours worked in aworkweek at rate 1 times rate 1 and adding the sum to the number of hoursworked at rate 2 times the number of hours worked at rate 2.   The sum isthen divided by the total number of hours worked to obtain the weightedaverage regular rate paid for each hour worked.   Overtime premiums of 1/2the weighted average regular rate are then paid to bring the overtime rateto 1.5 times the weighted average regular rate.   If, as in California,double time rates apply, the premium would be one times the weighted averageregular rate.Example:Employee works four 8-hour day shifts at $10 per hour and two 8-hour nightshifts with a shift premium of $! per hour within the same workweek.The weighted average calculation would be:32 (hours) times 10 (dollars) plus 16 (hours) times 111 (dollars) = 496(dollars)496 (dollars) divided by 48 (hours) = $10.333 (the weighted average regularrate)1/2 of $10.333 = $5.17 (the additional overtime premium due for each overtimehour worked).The weekly pay for this employee would be:$584.000 for straight time$ 41.36 for overtime premiumor$625.36 for the week.2. Rate-in-effectWith this method, the overtime pay is calculated at the rate in effect atthe time the overtime is worked.In the above example, if the last 8 hours of the week were worked on a dayshift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $10 or $15 and the employee would beentitled to $120 in overtime pay.   If the last shift was worked on the nightshift, the overtime rate would be 1.5 x $111 or $16.50 and the employee wouldbe due $130 in overtime pay.Please note: These are the federal standards.   State law must also beconsidered, since the employee is entitled to the most favorable provisionis there is a conflict.   For example, California does not permit the use ofthe rate-in-effect method; employees who work at different rates must bepaid on the weighted average overtime pay calculation.I hope this is helpful.

This case will be watched very closely because 1) it was filed against Microsoft, and 2) because of the large potential class of plaintiffs.   Class action suits are an employers worst nightmare (think Texaco and Coca-Cola). Please feel free to share this with your management.``` No. 2000Monday, October 16, 2000 Page A-3ISSN 15222-5968News   Discrimination Suit Filed by Microsoft Salaried EmployeeAlleges Discrimination Based on Race, Sex SEATTLE---A suit has been filed against Microsoft Corp. alleging the company maintains a systemic and pervasive practice of discriminating against African American and female salaried employees, affecting pay rates and promotion opportunities (Donaldson v. Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C000-1684P, 10/4/000). Such discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the lawsuit said. The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 4000 African American employees and some 4,5000 female employees. Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. \"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the lawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 4, 19998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 percent are women. Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft employees are women and 222.2 percent minorities, he said. The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &amp; Toll of Seattle. The named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft. \"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint said. The violations---of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 19991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871---are \"systemic in nature, and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's operations,\" the lawsuit maintains. 'Excessive Subjectivity' AllegedThe complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them.\" The lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation system\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\" Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scal, but scores of five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. \"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee with a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to resign, the complaint said. \"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. \"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal popularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working for different managers. In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries \"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit said. Furthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees.

Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do   sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal   government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier'   contractor.   (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I   have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him   today.)   Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to   abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors.   Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare   affirmative action plans.   In addition, we do not feel that we are   subject to an OFCCP audit.   Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not   included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's   status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1   and AAPs.   Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any   of this.   Hoyt\n"

We do not anticipate a need for utilizing their resources until Feb/March at the soonest, but as these agreements sometimes take a while to negotiate, I believe it appropriate to start this one soon.

Apparently, they have temporary employees who work on projects and then leave the company.   These are hourly employees who do not work regularly.   Originally, these employees were thought to be included in the scope of Project 50 by corp.   Mike Indivero called me and said that these people should not receive the 50 options because they are not \"regular, full-time or regular part-time employees\" as described in the memo from the Office of the Chairman.What are   your thoughts on that?   Should they be included or not? My reading of the email to all employees is that it does not include temporary employees.   Do you know how other temporary employees were treated?Let me know what you think.Thanks, as always.Michelle\n"

I understand those schedules are being prepared and will be forwarded to us together with a possibly revised version of this agreement.   Also coming over is a form of debt purchase agreement.Once I have received those agreements and have had an opportunity to review them together with their schedules I expect further changes will result.   Further changes may also result from the continuation of due diligence through the course of this week and next.However, I think the enclosed is a dramatic improvement from Enron's perspective over the form of purchase and sale agreement proposed by KPMG.I look forward to discussing this with you.

We still need to have a conference call with the HR team at GP to ascertain the climate of labor relations and other employment issues.Woodland1.   Employment Claims:   In the list of insurance matters, there are several employment-related claims.   Those include sexual harassment allegations, disability discrimination, retaliation, and mistreatment.   It is unclear whether those are ongoing claims or not.   I would question whether the mill has had harassment prevention training, and if so, when.   Also, are there other employment claims that are not identified in the documents?   2. Labor Union matters:   Rick Johnson is going to review the collective bargaining agreements.   I am waiting on a list of union grievances, which is supposed to be forwarded to me today.3.   I saw nothing about employment contracts, change of control agreements, or other documents that may require a buyer to provide benefits after closing for either Woodland.Leaf River 1.   Litigation Summary:   The company provided a summary of litigation.   Three of the four are personal injury claims --- one is a fall down stairs by a delivery person (settled on 7/14/000); another is a contract employee who was injured when a propane truck on a forklift exploded in his face, and the third is another contract employee who fell down some stairs (settled 7/27/000).   The fourth is a race discrimination claim from 19991, which has been on hold due to the plaintiff's bankruptcy.   The summary states that the corporate law department has more details about the personal injury claims.   We may want to obtain more detailed information as we proceed in this transaction.   Are there other litigation matters or pending claims?   (E.g., EEOC).2.   No employment contracts.   I saw nothing about change of control agreements or other documents that may require a buyer to provide post-closing payments.3.   Workers Comp:   There are several workers comp claims for 1999 and 19998.   I would suggest that our risk/insurance groups review these claims to make sure that they are not unusual.Dee Lenfest is going to review the material on employee benefits and should provide a separate analysis on that topic.Michelle---"

        " Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT on 111/14/2000 111:12 PM ---Michelle Cash111/02/2000 05:17 PMTo: Timothy J Detmering/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne C Koehler/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick Wade/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Fran L Mayes/HOU/ECT@ECT, fmackin@aol.com, David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Project Triple Lutz --- HR Issues with Bidder DThis email summarizes my conversation on employee matters with Nancy Quigg Young, which took place   yesterday.Logistics.   The most significant area for the employee matters involves the logistics of the buyer hiring the employees.   In the original agreement that we proposed, we would allow the buyer to interview employees, select the ones they wanted to hire, and require that the buyer keep them employed for at least 2 years.   Their counter proposal was that they got to hire who they wanted, have us pay severance on all others, and they would have no obligation to keep them for any length of time.Since then, there have been discussions internally that we want all employees to go with the sale, with the buyer taking the action of severing employees (although we would fund severance costs under the Enron formula).   I raised that proposal with Nancy, who is going to discuss it with her business clients.   In the alternative, if the buyer selects the people it hires, and we have to eliminate the jobs for those not selected, I informed her that we would require an indemnity for claims made against us based on the selection process.   Base Salary.   The counteroffer made by Bidder D does not provide that the employees hired from HPL would receive at least the same base salary as they earn at Enron.   This is important because a severance payment could be due if an employee does not accept a job at a lower salary.   Karen appeared unwilling to agree to pay divested employees outside of the buyer's salary bands (note:   paying outside of a salary band in the context of an acquisition is standard procedure, but she was acting as if it were an incredibly difficult accomplishment).   She claimed that one problem lies in not knowing the exact salary for each employee at issue.   We pushed back on this and offered to provide average salaries for each job level, to allow her to get comfortable with the ranges.   Fran Mayes will provide this information, which may eliminate this issue.Bonus.   In our proposal, we asked that the hired employees receive a total bonus payment that is at least equal to what they earned their last year at Enron.   Bidder D did not provide any such guarantee.   Karen said that she needed our \"bonus formula\" before she could commit to this.   I explained that we have no bonus formula and that our bonuses are based on performance of the company and the individual.   We previously had provided total bonus amounts for the entire group, and she could make a determination of bonus costs on a consolidated basis for her deal folks to calculate.   jShe said she was \"not sure if they could get there\" on the bonus issue, particularly since she thinks our bonuses will be extra high this year.   I offered to discuss whether we could modify the amounts by averaging the last two years, which she thought might make it better.   Unvested Equity.   When I explained to her that we could not supervest unvested options, she indicated that there was a \"possibility\" that the amount could be made up in stock options of Bidder D.   I think this is the \"win-win\" position, but I think it will have to be pushed.Vacation.   Their vacation plan maxes out at 4 weeks; ours maxes out at 5 weeks.   She thinks she may be able to propose that, for the first year the employees work for the buyer, they can use the vacation accrual from Enron, but after that, they are subject to the buyer's vacation plan.   This approach is reasonable.WARN Act.   There is the slight possibility of WARN Act implications, in the unlikely event that closing occurs within 60 days of signing.   The WARN   Act requires a company to give employees 60 days notice of a plant closing or mass layoff.   This situation probably would qualify.   Thus, we would have to give 60 days notice to all employees who potentially may be affected.   We can pay in lieu of notice, in the event that the closing (and thus the terminations) occur sooner than 60 days after closing, but we may want to spell out who bears that cost, if it is incurred.Benefits.   Other than the vacation benefit described above, it appears that Bidder D has benefits that generally are of the same nature as Enron's benefits.   Thus, allowing the hired employees to participate in the buyer's benefits plans, with credit for years of service at Enron, likely would be comparable to their situations here.I expect that we will hear from Bidder D with their proposals on these issues once Fran provides Nancy with the salary data.   Please let me know if you have any questions.Michelle\n"

MichelleTransactionsMajor Events of September - November 2000Garden State Paper --- closing and transition.Triple Lutz --- issues surrounding potential divestiture, including internal discussions, review of data requests and responses, review and comment on both PSA documents, negotiations with both buyer's representatives, and discussions with clients.   Issues include salaries of employees hired by buyer (effect of Enron severance plan), other benefits for divested employees (including unvested stock options, insurance, vacation, etc.), process for divesture, payment of severance obligations, possible redeployment, etc.Crane --- monitor due diligence, PSA review and comment, client discussions.Falcon --- review diligence reports, client discussions.E2   --- limited involvement in PSA and schedule review, data requests.Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001Triple Lutz --- continued negotiations and document drafting.   Transition issues for divestiture will continue to be significant.   Litigation by persons who lose their jobs as a result of the transaction and who choose not to sign the waiver for double the severance benefits is possible.East Coast Power:   If we sell our interest in ECP, there will be many transition issues due to Enron's providing benefits, payroll, etc. for ECP personnel.   Also, there will be transition issues for other services, including legal services that Enron has been providing for ECP.Crane/Falcon --- could move forward; Crane is more likely.   Issues of labor unions and Canadian law will require attention on transition issues.LitigationMajor Events of September - November 2000No employee-initiated litigation for 2000.Non-compete litigation:   Currently, suit pending against Alonzo Williams in Sharolyn Wood's court.   Suit filed, no TRO sought.   Service in process.Minor litigation:   Marentz &amp; Co. v. Enron.   Suit for non-payment of placement fee.   Maximum damages $75K.   Discovery period ends this week, court-ordered mediation to follow.Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001I expect that we will be filing non-compete litigation in February and March, as people leave after they are paid their bonuses.   We should discuss the continued use of Bill Ogden for non-compete litigation.Documents GeneratedMajor Events of September - November 2000New Consulting Services Agreement:   I prepared a new form of Consulting Services Agreement to replace old Master Service Agreement and Project Work Description for Net Works contract personnel. I received minor comments from outside counsel as well as client group feedback.   I will finalize the agreement, so that the new document can go into effect on 1/1/01.   Standard Agreements:I prepared:   ___ draft employment agreements. ___ draft consulting services agreements.   ___ separation agreement and releases. ___ retention letter agreements.The number of employment agreements seems low to me, particularly in trading.   My understanding is that Lavorato does not want to put every person in trading under contract, but wants to wait and see how they perform.   There are potential legal risks with this approach if we want to enforce our non-compete provisions. Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001I expect that, after bonus amounts are announced, there will be a flurry of contract activity in efforts to pay people through means other than the bonus pool.   InvestigationsMajor Events of September - November 2000Anonymous Letters Sent to Office of Chairman about Energy Operations:   I directed the investigation and supervised outside consultants once the company decided to employ them.   I and the team reviewed the results with Sally Beck in early November and proposed methods to address the results of the consultants' surveys.   Sally Beck is contemplating communication to employees on results of survey.   [Other proposals can be discussed verbally.]Texaco Hacker:   We had a situation where one of our employees logged onto the Texaco computer system using an ID of a former co-worker.   He then sent inappropriate emails to her co-workers, posing as her.   The investigation results led to termination of employment for cause.Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001I expect that there will be some claims that will need to be investigated following PRC/bonus discussions. TrainingMajor Events of September - November 2000 Increased role as trainer.   I provided interview training for all Net Works employees who are involved in the Technology Track (about 10 sessions).   Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001   EIM:   Ray Bowen has asked Julia and I to provide training to the Industrials Group.   The focus will be on labor and employment issues in the acquisition of assets as well as the integration of assets into the Enron family.   All of Wholesale:   The harassment prevention training is going to be repeated early next year for all persons hired in the last 18 months.   Refresher training is being developed and will be delivered for those who already went through the first round.Pre-Hire Testing Major Events of September - November 2000Many Wholesale groups are looking at pre-employment testing as a method of screening out applicants.   I am working with the Training and Development groups to ensure that the tests meet legal standards.   I have suggested experts for HR to use in validation of such tests to ensure that the tests will result in a successful employee.Re-Skilling:   One aptitude test is being employed in the selection of potential employees who may be re-skilled to perform IT jobs working under Beth Perlman. Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001I expect the testing issue to continue to be hot, particularly since John Lavorato likes the concept for use in the Trading Track rotations for the A&amp;A program.Employee Relations/Terminations   Much of my time is spent providing advice on employee relations/termination issues --- approximately 10-15 per week (total).   No two situations are alike, and they require significant time.Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001After PRC/bonus time, this area of practice will be exceptionally busy.   The company will put persons who received a Needs Improvement or lower rating on a performance improvement plan.   Generally, I review those before they are put in place.   If they are not successful, then terminations are likely (probably early in the first half of 20001).   Those issues are time-consuming and full of risks.Work for Portfolio AssetsMajor Events of September - November 2000Ecogas:   wind-down issues.Mariner:   Change of Control Agreements.CGAS:   harassment prevention training --- arranged for Littler, Mendelson to provide training for CGAS personnel.East Coast Power:   Agreements, advice and counselling on various issues.Anticipated Issues for December 2000 - February 20001CGAS:   Revising employment agreements for key personnel.Mariner:   Employment agreement negotiation.ConclusionsENA:   ENA has not been able to hire commercial talent at the levels of manager and above.   I expect to see a great emphasis on hiring.   Lavorato has placed processes in place for hiring at that level, including the requirement of an interview with the OOC before someone can be hired at the level of manager or above.   Salaries need to be reviewed for equity (by gender as well as by race).Net Works:   Net Works has hired over 8000 employees and contractors in 2000.   I expect that a portion of those will be bad hires and will have to be managed out.   Generally, the IT personnel are not the best about counselling and documentation, so there may be significant work to be done to   ensure that risks are managed in that situation.   I have seen improvement in that group working with HR, and they have invited me to conduct training, so it may improve over time.Contractors are another issue at Net Works.   A significant portion of the work force is contract personnel.   Microsoft issues could arise if contractors are allowed to stay on too long.Misclassification under the FLSA is another issue.   Net Works has too many employees in the \"exempt\" category who should be classified as \"non-exempt.\"   I have raised this issue with HR, and they are working through it.   It will not be an easy fix.EIM:   The biggest issues facing EIM include the attraction and retention of talent as well as M&amp;A activity.   HR has hired a person from Azurix to handle diligence for EIM, but only time will tell whether she will be able to handle the job.   EGM:   EGM has the same issues of hiring and retention of talent as other groups within Wholesale.   That, plus the added earnings pressures, will make retention of key personnel essential.   I expect to see continued pressure to shorten the non-compete duration for this group.\n"

I don't agree to all the terms in here, and Ireally don't want to spend a lot of time with ELT to negotiate theagreement.   For example, the part where we will be billed for developmentalcosts if we cancel within a certain period of time.   From my perspective,that is inappropriate since I spent more time than ELT on developing thisproduct, and   you are simply delivering a product that you and I alreadyprepared and completed on several occasions across North America.   Therewill be one new scripted section, but that should be from the actors, andit should not be significant.   Also, there are not appropriateconfidentiality provisions, etc.   So, I would have to negotiate it with ELTfor it to be acceptable to us.The last time, you just billed for time, and the actors billed separately.I prefer that approach, if we can do it that way.   If I am being a majorprima donna and it creates a big problem for you internally, let me know,and I can review it and comment back to ELT.Thanks.   Michelle---"

Sharon Butcher and I are working on a project for Enron Corp. HR that requires research on data protection laws in the various countries in which Enron has employees.   It is likely that we will subscribe to Clifford Chance's Nextlaw service, a database of data protection legislation in various countries.   One of the advantages of Nextlaw is that it is a more cost-effective approach than engaging local counsel in each jurisdiction to provide the legal research, and subscribers are entitled to quarterly updates of the information on the database during the annual subscription period.   At the end of my message to Christopher, please see the list of countries that we need information about.   My guess is that any of the jurisdictions you need are covered.   If so, I would propose to Christopher that if (as I anticipate) Enron Corp. subscribes to Nextlaw for the project Sharon and I are working on, Enron Europe should be entitled to access and use the information for the other project Christopher references.   We certainly don't want Enron to pay for the subscription service twice! Please tell me which lawyer in your group I should include in discussions.   Thanks---",

Don't quote me on this but, to my knowledge, of the remaining 12only Columbia has a data protection law which is currently in force andCanada has a new law which is not yet in force.I am copying this to my colleague Ben Ebdon in our Clifford Chance Onlinegroup in the hope that he will be able to join us on the call on Monday.In the meantime, I hope you have a good weekend.Best regardsChristopher___Christopher Millard, Clifford ChanceLimited Liability Partnership2000 Aldersgate Street, London, EC1A 4JJ, EnglandVoice: +444 20 7956 00023 / Fax: +444 20 76000 555Email: christopher.millard@cliffordchance.com___---Original Message---From: Kelly.Noel.Higgason@enron.com[mailto:Kelly.Noel.Higgason@enron.com]Sent: Friday, May 19, 2000 5:41 PMTo: christopher.millard@cliffordchance.comCc: Sharon.Butcher@enron.comSubject: nextlawChristopher:   You may remember me from our conversations about 18 months ago, whichresulted in Enron subscribing to Clifford Chance's Nextlaw subscriptionservice.   Enron's annual subscription lasped several months ago, but we arein need of similar services again for a different HR project.   Enron seniormanagement has tasked the HR department with the creation of an internal\"expert directory\" with which all Enron employees can identify other Enronemployees who have specific skills (such as language capabilities,experience with particular kinds of projects, political contacts, etc.)that may be useful for new intiatives.   As you can imagine, the data thatmust be collected from all Enron employees worldwide is significantly morecomplex than the information we were gathering from international employeeswhen we engaged your firm previously.   We would now like legal advice aboutwhat consents must be obtained from employees in various foreignjurisdictions in order to collect and publish the information, whethercertain information gathered must be requested on a voluntary basis (andconversely, what information we can require that employees provide), etc.[Please note that all information to be requested will be collected forbusiness purposes (our internal legal department has already informed HRand management that certain information about personal interests, hobbies,and non-professional memberships should not be collected or asked for.)]   I am hopeful that in the time since we last spoke, your firm has addedadditional jurisdictions to the subscription service, since many of thecountries in which we have employees were not on the database in early1999.   I will list the jurisdictions that are relevant for this project atthe end of this message; however, in certain jurisdictions, Enron has onlya few employees, and we may elect not to include those employees in theexpert directory if we determine that the cost of the legal research forthat jurisdiction is not justified by the benefit to Enron.   I am alsowondering whether the information included in the database is sufficientfor this more complicated project.   My colleague, Sharon Butcher, and I would like to discuss our newproject with you to see if Clifford Chance is again willing and able toprovide the local research that we require, and to get an estimate of thecost involved.   We were hoping to call you at 9:000 am Houston time onMonday, May 222nd.   Please let me know if this time is not convenient, andwe will arrange for another call.   I can be reached by telephone(713-853-5698), fax (713-646-5847), or email (kelly.noel.higgason@enron).I hope you are well, and look forward to our work together.Regards,Kelly Noel HiggasonArgentinaAustraliaBrazilCanadaChinaColombiaFinlandGermanyGuatemalaHungaryIndiaIndonesiaItalyJamaicaJapanMexicoNetherlandsNorwayPhilippinesPolandPuerto RicoRussian FederationSingaporeSpainSwedenThailandTurkeyUnited KingdomVenezuela***This message and any attachment are confidential and may be privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure.

I recently joined the Enron Corp. legal staff from Enron International legal.   My role in this project is to coordinate the international legal support for the new option plan.   As such, I have contacted lawyers in various international business units to work with local counsel in each of the countries in which Enron has employees who will participate in the plan, to ensure that the plan does not run afoul of any legal restrictions.   Based on current information (which is likely to change between now and December, per Melissa Laing), the relevant countries in the Enron Europe group are Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Turkey.   In the attachment labeled \"asiapac\" at the end of Jana Domke's message, you will find spreadsheets for all five of the Enron Europe companies.   Please review (with local counsel, if necessary) the information in the \"Legal Compliance\" section of each spreadsheet to confirm that the information therein is accurate.   Please forward any changes or comments to me and Jana Domke (Jana has requested that the review be complete by June 23rd).   The Public Relations department is currently preparing the written material that will communicate the details of the plan to the participating employees.   When that is available, I will send it to you so that you may make any modifications that are necessary to comply with local laws in each of the Enron Europe countries.   The communication documents will be available in English, Spanish, Portuguese, German and Greek.   Please call me at 713-853-5698 with any questions.   Thank you for your assistance!Kelly---",

In most instances, the plan design replicates the prior Plan parameters.   However, on an international basis, there have been numerous regulatory and legislative changes which may impact this program.Attached are individual Country Summary Highlights which consolidate the various accounting/tax/legal/banking/human resource, etc. details and issues into one document.   This consolidated document is based not only on information gleaned from the previous AESOP inplementation, but it also reflects the most recent local tax changes - at least based upon the information we have here.Because successful Plan implementation and rollout is predicated upon solid information, understanding and interpretation, we need your assistance.   Please coordinate review of the your appropriate country documents with your local financial, legal, tax and/or other professionals, as required.   We want to ensure that AESOP incents our employees and reinforces the \"One ENRON\" philosophy - but at the same time, we need to ensure this program is cost effective, tax efficient, legally defensible and culturally acceptable in your areas of responsibility. Please document any specific issues and/or concerns, and where appropriate, provide input on viable options, corrective action, etc... Also, if you have plans to be in other foreign locations prior to AESOP implementation and they need to be included, please advise ASAP.   Please send your responses via e-mail to either Dung Huynh or myself or by fax to (713) 646-7203.   If you have questions or if you need to discuss further, please call me @ (713) 345-6142.   Our timeline is tight so would appreciate your responses at the latest by June 23rd - earlier if possible.   Once we have the input, we'll roll this information up into a revised Summary Document, identifying issues that need further assessment/discussion and move forward to coordiinate final resolution with the AESOP team members.Appreciate your assistance!Regards/Jana Domke &amp; Dung HuynhPS - I apologize ahead of time for not getting all the countries correctly sorted by region.

He mentioned to me that Tony's primary concern is the nonsolicitation.   Although I think Tony is being a little more reasonable than John Paskoff, we need to be somewhat consistent with what we provide both of them.   They are both very close.I think the following would be a fair offer for both of them.Additional 15,000.   This would give Paskoff and additional 2.5 months salary and Cirino almost 2 months salary.   This get them closer to the 12-13 months pay they are both asking for.   Plus, Michelle brought up a point about them incurring attorney's fees and this should well cover it.Payment of their COBRA premiums through the term of their MG contract ( 9 mos )No   on the bonus paymentsNo on waiving or reducing the non solicitation of customers, unless Hutch want's to accommodate this.They will probably both push back on the non solicitation, but I would rather wait to see how theyr respond to our offer.Michelle, what are your thoughts?ThanksCathy \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. - Europe \tFrom:   Melissa Laing @ ECT   10/20/2000 04:38 AM To: Catherine Huynh/NA/Enron@ENRONcc: Nigel Sellens/LON/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Twanda Sweet/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Anthony (Tony) Cirino   Hi Cathy,Mike Hutchninson is out of the office until Monday, so I will follow up with him on Monday.

The report indicates that 8/14/95, the candidate was found guilty of theft, a misdemeanor.   He was sentenced to 3 days jail and fined $2000.   The candidate indicated on his Contractor Information Sheet that he had a misdemeanor from 19995.   Should we have the recruiter contact the candidate and ask for more information about the misdemeanor, or should we simply reject him?Thanks for your assistance.Candace\n"

One small change is currently contemplated however.   Seller has insisted that we give them a maximum number of non-union employees that we will want them to terminate.   We have suggested that the maximum number be 30.   This seems good at least for WARN Act purposes.   As it is currently contemplated (not in the documents but rather in the most recent negotiations), we would provide the Seller with written notice (no later than 3 or 4 business days before closing but after our financing contingency has expired) as to which employees would need to be terminated.   One other thing that I have heard is that we want the Seller to be the terminating party because the commercial folks would prefer not to have to tell our analysts that we did the firing.   If you and the other labor folks feel strongly about making the Buyer the terminating party, please call me ASAP and I can hook you in with Rodney Malcolm et al to discuss.   The deal is set to be finalized tomorrow.Stuart\n"

I agree with your concerns about the tortious interference situation.   Do you have any suggestions on mitigating that risk?   My thought would be to request an indemnity for the t.i. claim if it is received.   Alternatively, we can ask for a waiver for all persons who are terminated and ask that   the buyer be a beneficiary/waived party.   Any ideas?Michelle---"

I thought we put this issue to bed several years ago.   Consultants and Contractors are to be reviewed, if at all, by their respective employers.   If the Consultant and/or Contractor is not an employee of a third party employer, then Enron has the right to determine if they are meeting the terms and provisions of their contract.   However, this does not mean they are to be included in the PEP and PRC process. To include them opens too many doors with respect to the proper classification of these individuals.   If we treat them like employees, we may find that a court determines they should be employees and thus eligible for all employee benefits, a la MicroSoft.   Thanks.

That is the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It   applies to non-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the   equivalent provisions in the collective agreement do not \"meet or exceed\" the   Act's provisions. Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than   the provisions in the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply to   union employees.?In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the   collective agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of   the year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but   I'll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may   actually have to take that time off without any pay if they've already elected   to take the pay earlier.?For both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned   and accrued in one year and paid out the next. So in 20001, all Celgar employees   will be entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000   earnings.?With respect to the standard employment contract, there really   isn't one, save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all   employees. The letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the   package I sent on Friday last week. If you don't have it, please let me know and   I'll send it.?There are also position descriptions for every union and   non-union employees that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might   also be considered part of the contract of employment, though they are not   incorporated into a letter of employment.?Hope that answers your questions. Please let me know if I may   be of further assistance.?Dean&lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;Michelle.Cash@enron.com&lt; 12/111/000 01:25PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Thanks,   Dean.Two questions have arisen based upon your diligence   summary:1.? Do you have a copy of the \"standard\" employment   letter??? We haven'tseen it (or, at least I haven't).2.? What   is meant by the 4-6% vacation pay??? How does that work??? How   arethe pre-payments made??? Does the person get the money early and then   notget paid for time off later on??? Additional explanations would be   helpful.Thanks.Michelle\"Dean Crawford\"   &lt;dcrawford@davis.ca&lt; on 12/111/2000 02:10:27 PMTo:???   &lt;pdelvec@ect.enron.com&lt;,   &lt;Michelle.Cash@enron.com&lt;cc:??? \"Brian Hiebert\"   &lt;BFH@davis.ca&lt;Subject:?

In? turn,?theAct?provides employers statutory immunity   from?damages? in respect of anypersonal injury, disablement or   death arising out of and in? the course ofemployment.The   accident fund would cover asbestos claims.

As we discussed, you are in the process of researching and documenting the same information for the non-payroll companies which of course is critical for completing our due diligence with respect to the new AESOP.In order to get this information for determining AESOP participation, and as we dscussed today, we are asking the HR leadership team to work with their business units to provide us with all non-payroll company names (to provide legal name, if different), % ownership, whether or not the company is part of Enron's consolidated reporting group (if not, why) and number of employees.   They will also give us a \"yes\" or \"no\" at this time as to whether their Business Unit Head wishes for the company to participate in AESOP.   We are asking them to forward this file to you, as we discussed, to assist you with data collection.   We would ask that you coordinate the necessary Legal review of ownership levels with Michelle Cash.   We will facilitate with Johnna Young a review of whether we will have any accounting issues with granting options to employees of each respective company.   We have a tight turnaround, of course, as outlined in today's meeting, but hopefully we have good game plan to get us to where we need to be.

If it is a fact that they are Enron employees, we have to figure out the liability associated with terminating them!   It appears that on Monday, MG and Enron leadership will decide to exit some of the London and New York RW business that MG acquired, and some (minimum 9, max 15) of the former RW employees will need to be terminated during August.   John Sheriff and Gary Hickerson both want to know the cost of that decision.   Right now we are assuming that we are liable for the severance periods stated in the offer letters to the people; we would like to be able to avoid that cost   (estimated at $7000k and $1.5M, depending on who is redundant) or reduce it if possible.   However, if it is your recommendation that we have to honor those letters, so be it.If you have any questions, please call Melissa Laing (tie line 8303 66617) in the UK and she can find me.

It is my understanding that we own the assets of RW, and that we decided to hire certain, key personnel from RW.   The remaining RW employees do not automatically come with the assets.   I am working on obtaining more information on the RW side of things from lawyers here in the US.   Key to employment decisions will be provisions of the asset purchase agreement, if any are applicable.   You might check with Jon Chapman in the UK to see whether he has any more information on this point.   Thanks.

They are all very similar to the one or two that I have already given you.I believe that we will not want to keep some of the businesses that are being acquired with Rudolph Wolff, particularly the FX business in New York.   Naturally, some of the people in the potentially discontinued business received the onerous letters.   Gary Hickerson has to decide what he is going to do with this by August 18, if not sooner.   With the letters that were delivered , I would like to get an opinion from you on what we have to do to terminate the people associated with the business, assuming that Gary wants to shut it down.Also, MG have 4 to 6 employees in Montreal.   We (HR) are trying to convince the business side that we do not want any people in Montreal because of the employment laws . . . but it does not appear that we will succeed.   We may reduce the size of the office, though, and we may not want to put them on the Canadian payroll, particularly is we only keep 1-2 people there.   Do you have contacts in Montreal that can advise us on how to terminate any employees that we choose to terminate?   What would be the Enron position on having them on a separate payroll from Enron Canada?ThanksHoyt\n"

Robert had mentioned that we should be able to get back with them this week, and I think we should make good on the promise.Here are my recommendations - please give me your thoughts.1)   I owe the Account Manager an apology for being rude on the phone.2)   Clarify with them that we do not owe them a fee on Mark Delaro or John Nguyen, based on above facts.3)   Clarify with them that we are not doing business with them at this time.

We should let them know that yes, they do have an MSA which is an agreement for contract placement, but this does not require us to accept resumes from them.   We accept resumes only from those agencies that we ask to assist us with recruiting.   We should offer to take another look at them in 90 days, give them a second chance, and have the guidelines for the trial period well defined.   They should contact me directly at that time.4)   We should address the relationship between Jennifer and Kathryn, the difficulties being that Jennifer made a decision not to work with them, Kathryn tried to force her business on Jennifer after the decision had been made, and Kathyrn brought her personal problems into the conversation in order to press the point.   They should be aware of the basis of Jennifer's decision not to employ them as a vendor:   1)   inadequate resume flow   2) poor working relationship with account manager.5)   We have no proof that Jennifer has spread bad press about CS to any other company including Continential, Shell Services, and Dynegy, and after addressing this issue with her do not believe that this occurred.

I think the way to couch it is that we do not want to receive them at this time, but that they are free to check with us in a couple of months to see whether that has changed.   That way, we aren't making it an absolute ban.Thanks for the information.MichelleDebi Vanwey08/111/2000 09:27 AMTo: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Contracting Solutions   Thanks for your feedback.   If we accept resumes from an agency it means establishing a full working relationship with them which is time consuming for the recruiter.   We have to constantly QA them and answer their phone calls, and it is more work than it seems from the outside.   They almost need to be coached all the time unless they are really good, which is rare.   CS is one of the fairly high maintenance agencies.   This is why we are going to a preferred vendor list.   We have lots of agencies that want to work with us, and choosing those that we can count on to get us good candidates quickly, and take the least amount of our time saves a lot of time for the recruiters.   After Jennifer told Kathyrn she wasn't going to work with her, Kathyrn did flood her inbox with unsolicited resumes.   That would certainly make me not want to work with them.   I can force the issue and ask one of the recruiters to work with them if you feel we need to, however I feel that until Kathryn cools off a little, this would not be productive.   As for the apology, I will always apologize if I am clearly in the wrong, however, I think that definitely in this case it would be construed as an admission of wrongdoing on Enron's part.   I'm fine with letting go of it.   This has been a good learning experience for me.   There have been a couple of phone calls this week where I was consciously more polite with agency/sales phone calls than I would have been prior to last week.   Jennifer had some fear up yesterday about addressing an issue with an agency because of the CS issue, which is understandable, and we're working through it together.   I want her to be able to stay in her power with these people, and we just need to learn new ways to do that.   It's a tough job dealing with agencies day after day - really wears you down.   We're going to write some scripts for talking with them in the future, and the recruiters will route all the new ones through me so they all get the same story.   We're also putting some new processes in place so that we are consistent in our relationships with agencies.   Hopefully this will help eliminate some of these issues in the future.

We should probably look carefully at their current jobs to determine if they are DOT-covered or not.   If they are performing DOT-covered jobs, their employer should be required to have a DOT Drug and Alcohol Testing program, if not it is not necessary to test them on a random basis.   The only random testing this company allows is for DOT-covered   and safety sensitive employees in NEPCO and OEC.   Also we have no means to test employees from other companies since our random selection is accomplished through our payroll system, nor do we want to be in the business of testing other's employees.   Hope that helps.

Per the transition agreement, EDS had continued the program with an external drug testing vendor after we were outsourced to EDS back in 1985. We need to get our staff into the Enron internal program. Not everyone in my group is effected, but most are. I've listed the names below. The Gas Control support staff is framiliar with the program and aware that they are required to participate. I haven't heard anything about it from anyone since the transition back to Enron so I am assuming this slipped through the cracks.The staff listed below all support Gas Control, have access to the SCADA systems, and could have significant impact to the operation of the applications used in Gas Control to monitor and control the pipeline.

A couple of other company reps said it is especially pertinent to HR issues, such as transmitting personnel information, salary, etc. from Europe back to the home office in the US.Given our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe, does this affect us, and do you want us to track down more information?Regards,Steve Burns\n"

Daniel Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.   Congress passed the EEA in 19996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate America collects, uses, and protects valued information.   In addition to explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include \"hypothetical\" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) to illustrate his points.This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls (CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of competitive intelligence.   This particular speaking engagement is designed to raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.   The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:000 PM, in the 50th floor Conference room.   Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell. P.S.   By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the \"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),\" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.\n"

In other words if I resigned in 4 years (and assuming no further service contract had been put in place) the company could prevent me taking another job for upto 3 months after the termination if there was pay for that period.Two other points;The new paragraph in 3.4 could be read to infer that the Monthly Base Salary for the non-compete period would be paid up-front. Would it be safer to pay monthly conditional upon compliance with the obligations?Have we thought about the enforcability of the 12 month non-compete for resignations during the term? This is not a concern to me and I am content with the existing arrangement for my contract. However, as a far as the precedent is concerned I would like a provision we could definitely enforce.I will call you tomorrow to discuss.\n"

It does apply to US citizens working for Enron in foreign locations (i.e. extraterritorially).   Before we go forward and do this type of testing, it is useful to ascertain the purpose/goal of the tests.   Why do they want this information?   Is there another, less intrusive, way to obtain that information (e.g., references from prior employers, etc.)?   As noted below, there may be Japanese labor/employment law issues that address this type of activity as well.   I suggest that we obtain the information above as well as the opinion requested below and then determine how to proceed.Michelle\tJohn Viverito@ENRON\t05/111/2000 02:444 PM \t\t\t To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Enron and PDI JapanMichelle-Pursuant to my voicemail, I am forwarding the attached e-mail traffic for your consideration.   I am unsure as to the types of testing contemplated, but want to ensure that such activities are permitted under Enron's policy.Your comments on the attached agreement would also be appreciated.

PDI have agreed to me doing this via email, however are seeking some reassurance as to our use of and maintenance of confidentiality of the final product.

It is very important that certain benefits matters be addressed and resolved before the Closing Date.Attached is a copy of our Benefits Required Action list, which was sent to Dolores Lenfest, Mark Greenberg, and Mr. del Vecchio on July 21, 2000.   We spoke with Stuart Zisman today, who suggested we make sure that both of you have receive a recent copy of the list.   (Please let us know if you have any problems opening the WordPerfect document.   The page set-up to print should be 'landscape'.)Among the outstanding issues is the amount of potential withdrawal liability existing in the 2 multiemployer pension plans.   These numbers should be requested from the multiemployer plans as soon as possible.   A concern has been raised as to whether requesting such information from the multiemployer plans will create problems with the union or plan because the union or plan might be given the false impression that GSP anticipates terminating these benefits.   We do not expect any such problems (especially if the plan is told that the sale is anticipated and the buyer wants to make sure of its potential liabilities).   A request for withdrawal liability, although not a daily event, is something that falls within the ordinary administration of a plan.   The plans should either have this amount immediately available, or be able to calculate this amount for you.   If you would like us to assist you with obtaining this information, please let us know.We have included Dolores Lenfest as the responsible person for the majority of the required actions, since she had been our main contact.   If any of these actions have been assigned to another responsible party, please let us know.Thank you.Ann MurrayCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may beprotected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

While I think Enron has a very strong defense tothe disability claim, I am less certain about the aiding and abetting claim.As we discussed, the Mass. Commission Against Discrimination allowedGignilliat to amend his charge to add this claim.   Gignilliat may be able tocreate enough of a fact contest about what the plant manager (DennisSherrin) told ANP   about his disability to at least get past the probablecause stage.   While I still think that in the end, Enron has a very goodchance of prevailing on the aiding and abetting claim, $7,5000 is a good,final resolution to avoid further litigation.

Please contact Margaret Daffin at 713/345-5083 as soon as possible to discuss the documentation necessary to initiate the transfer.   In addition, as part of the Performance Management Process at Enron, your job performance will be reviewed within the first 6 months of employment (year-end 2000).   If your job performance is within the top 333% of your peers (employees in the IT function at your level), we will sponsor you for an employment-based permanent residency application (green card).

Amanda Curless@ENRON06/19/2000 04:53 PMTo: Jane Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Green card VerbageTo get Andre, we have to have some language that provides him an assurance that we'll support him for a green card.

You will be reviewed for job performance within the first 6 months. If your job performance is within the top 333% of IT people at your level, we will support you for a green card process at the end of the 6 month review.

What I'd like to do is take this to the HR Council and have them assign a point person in each of their business units to coordinate getting this done for the current HR staff, in addition to all future additions to HR.3.   It should go in PH file, with a copy to me for my files. This will be incorporated into the \"Procedures\".4.   I have prepared a contractor agreement, which Derek Anderson has.   If you need a copy, let me know.   Yes I'd like this copy.   With so many contractors working in HR, I believe we need to also include them in this exercise.

Again, I was able to contact Rodney Tow, and Tow reported to me that he spoke with Joe Walker of TMAC this morning and told him that Enron did not want him at the party.   Tow will follow that up with a note to Walker.I believe Walker's confusion was created by Diane Neilsen.   Before he called Walker, Tow read to me a telefax that Neilsen had sent to Walker after hearing from Tow that we did not want Walker at the party.   The fax simply said that Enron did not want any type of religious orientation in the show, but never said that Enron didn't want him at the party.I also asked Walker how he was doing on getting our security in place.   Tow, who had just walked into the office when I called, said that he was working on it, that he had just received a letter from Neilsen regarding it (which he apparently had not read), and that he had to let me go because he had clients on the line.On another note:   I received a copy of a transmittal memorandum from Kriste Sullivan to Mike Rosen, which attaches an unexecuted copy of a confidential draft of the Master Consulting Services Agreement between Enron Corp. and Event Resources Inc. in this matter.   Kriste says in the memo that her records do not indicate that execution copies were prepared.The signature blanks are for Mark Palmer of Corp. and Ken Price of ERI (who has left).   I was going to try to interview Price anyway regarding such things as where ERI kept its money, whether he believed that when he signed the Hilton agreement he was signing as an agent, and other matters.   I can also ask him if he ever signed any master agreement with Enron.   What do you think?Britt\n"

Is there a less intrusive way to ask it?   Finally, the question about countries visited for personal reasons also is asking information that is not job-related.   What is the purpose of that inquiry?   Is there another way to gather that information?Let me stress that none of these inquiries is unlawful --- some of them may be unwise for the reasons I cited above.

And I told the employees that we would have some sort of response for them on the 17th when we do the \"intro to enron\" package that is described inthe other email I sent you.   Would you be able to look at the three benefits packages (Rudolph Wolff, MG-USA and Enron) and do a comparison?   also, will you have some time this week to talk about any benefits issues?

Microsoft Corp., W.D. Wash., No. C000-1684P, 10/4/000). Such discrimination at the company \"is the standard operating procedure,\" the lawsuit said. The suit filed Oct. 4 in federal court in Seattle seeks back pay, other job benefits, and compensatory and punitive damages for a proposed class of about 4000 African American employees and some 4,5000 female employees. Mark Murray, company spokesman, said Microsoft does not tolerate discrimination of any kind. \"We take these kinds of issues very seriously,\" Murray said regarding the lawsuit. The company has an \"active diversity policy\" and seeks to recruit and promote minorities and women, Murray told BNA Oct. 12. He said he could not comment on any specific aspects of the lawsuit. The class would include all current and former female salaried employees who worked for Microsoft beginning Feb. 23, 1999, and all current and former African American salaried employees who worked at the company beginning Oct. 4, 19998. Microsoft employs some 18,000 workers in the U.S. the complaint said. About 2.5 percent to 3 percent are African American and about 26 percent are women. Murray said the company has about 27,250 employees in the U.S., including 21,767 in Western Washington. In the U.S., 26.3 percent of Microsoft employees are women and 222.2 percent minorities, he said. The lawsuit was filed by Cohen, Milstein, Hausfeld &amp; Toll of Seattle. The named plaintiff, Monique Donaldson, sued on behalf of herself and a class of all similarly situated African American and similarly situated female salaried employees at Microsoft. \"African American and female salaried employees of Microsoft are routinely subjected to a pattern and practice of race and sex discrimination affecting the terms and conditions of their employment\" at the company, the complaint said. The violations---of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 19991, and Civil Rights Act of 1871---are \"systemic in nature, and constitute a pattern and practice of conduct which permeates Microsoft's operations,\" the lawsuit maintains. 'Excessive Subjectivity' AllegedThe complaint said the company allows \"excessive subjectivity\" in decisions involving promotions and compensation. Microsoft has retaliated against employees in the class who complained \"either internally or externally about Microsoft's treatment of African American and female employees by giving unjustified lowered performance evaluations and constructively terminating them.\" The lawsuit said the company \"uses an excessively subjective evaluation system\" that allows managers \"who are predominantly white males, to rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon merit.\" Performance evaluations, for instance, use a five-point scale, but scores of five, the highest number, are not awarded. Within any organization of the company, only a certain number of employees are allowed to receive each score, which can range from 2.5 to 4.5, the lawsuit said. \"Thus, no matter how good or bad the actual performance of employees a certain number of them must still receive the lower scores.\" Any employee with a 2.5 score is placed on a \"personal improvement plan\" or asked to resign, the complaint said. \"Stack rankings\" are used to rank employees in the same job category and organizational unit from best to worst, the complaint said. Employees can be ranked higher under the stack ranking than others who receive numerically higher performance evaluations, the lawsuit said. \"Obtaining higher stack rankings is often governed by an employees' personal popularity with other managers\" because the rankings mix employees working for different managers. In addition to allowing discrimination in performance appraisals, the company also has a pattern of paying African American and female employees salaries \"substantially lower\" than those paid white males doing similar work, with the same or lesser skills, and with similar or lesser experience, the lawsuit said. Furthermore, \"excessively subjective decisionmaking criteria\" are applied in promotions, which favor white males with fewer qualifications than African Americans and female employees.

Let me know if you want to attend, happy to have you there.Gerry, can you help me put an agenda together so that everyone knows what we are looking to achieve here. In broad terms I am looking to do the following:Update all on project we set HR Associate group and their recommendationsDiscuss their recommendations and look at any refinements or ideas we think we should also incorporate (see my thumb nail sketch notes inspired by Associate group below).Reaffirm commitment to take this project forward and agree:Team for doing soResources and timimgMethodology for agreeing final version.My ambition is that we (but in particular Andrea, Bob, Gerry, Tim, Tana, Dan, Neil, myself and possibly Suzanne if she can given the work she had already done in this area) all agree to contribute to this and get it done without the need for a formation of a new team or group. Obviously everyone welcome to participate.Tana/Dan,Can you cicruclate a summary of your teams proposals to this group so we they can review before meeting. Could you also agree within your team who you would like to attend this meeting (I would suggest 2 or 3 of you attend rather than all).ThanksDavidDavid Oxley09/26/2000 111:38 AMTo: Andrea Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bob Sparger/Corp/Enron@Enron, Gerry Gibson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Tim O'Rourke/Corp/Enron@Enron, Ted C Bland/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Daniel Brown/NA/Enron@Enron, Tana Cashion/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rhonna Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Mission Impossible - HR Associate Groups Recommendation and next stepsRhonna,Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the development of an HR \"value index\" at Enron.I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.David\n"

Except Utah, which&lt; she does not fancy. Your new prime minister (The Rt. Hon. Tony Blair, MP&lt; for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a&lt; world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without&lt; the need for further elections. Congress and the Senate will be&lt; disbanded.&lt;&lt; A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine whether any of&lt; you noticed.&lt;&lt; To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following&lt; rules are introduced with immediate effect:&lt; 1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary.&lt; Then look up \"aluminium\" . Check the pronunciation guide. You will be&lt; amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you&lt; should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.   Look up&lt; \"vocabulary\". Using the same&lt; twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as \"like\" and&lt; \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.&lt; Look up \"interspersed\" .&lt;&lt; 2. There is no such thing as \"US English\" . We will let Microsoft know&lt; on your behalf.&lt;&lt; 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.&lt; It really isn't that hard.&lt;&lt; 4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the&lt; good guys.&lt;&lt; 5. You should relearn your original national anthem, God Save The Queen,&lt; but only after fully carrying out task 1. We would not want you to get&lt; confused and give up half way through.&lt;&lt; 6. You should stop playing American football. There is only one kind of&lt; football. What you refer to as American football is not a very good&lt; game.   The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your&lt; borders may have noticed that no one else plays American\" football. You&lt; will no longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper&lt; football. Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls. It&lt; is a difficult game.&lt;&lt; Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which&lt; is similar to American football, but does not involve stopping for a&lt; rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like&lt; nancies). We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby sevens side&lt; by 20005.&lt;&lt; 7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if&lt; they give you any merde.

Please note...we will meet in the Board Room not the Dining room on the Mezzanine level... Our primary meeting objective will be to review where the team stands implementing the short term Action Plans for the Key Focus Areas established at the retreat. I understand that some very good work has been done and that several potential \"Wows\" are either currently being implemented or about to launch. We look forward to getting the latest status reports relative to accomplishing these critical activities and keeping the momentum flowing.Regards, Gerry Gibson\n"

The Exxon process has been challenged in court, and Dick has testified about its process; the cases have been in favor of the company.

Concern surrounds the apparent toughening of Satisf in particular and a belief that this makes distributing names into bottom 2 categories harder.I recall we changed wording due to some concerns you had expressed. Perhaps you can restate them here for everyone.However, regardless of above I remain of opinion that descriptors and labels are proving a distraction from what should be a more relative process. Perhaps the main message here is to convey something that helps us put these descriptors in the context of a guide only (starting point or indicative illustration) rather than absolute scale. Bottom-line it is rather difficult to see how we could change any of this for the mid year.David\n"

As Cynthia states below, the new company (as a whole) would not be adopting benefit plans.   Logistically, there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires on the correct company.Also, the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once SAP Payroll comes online 7/1.

The new payroll company will simply not adopt the plans.   I am assuming that the number of employees (nor associated demographics) in this company will not create a discrimination problem.   One question though, will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not.   If the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps.Let me know if we can help.Cb   \tFrom:   Jane Allen @ ECT   12/16/999 10:52 AM To: Michael B Jones/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: David O'Dell/HR/Corp/Enron@Enron, Cynthia Barrow/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Joyce/HR/Corp/Enron@Enron, David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Payroll Company for Incoming Foreign NationalsAs Enron expands globally, we are faced with a growing issue of more and more foreign nationals entering the US on varied lengths of assignment.   For some, it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the fact they will return to their home country to retire.   If they remain on their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well as receive US $.Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.   He is paid by the UK a portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.   The remainder of his salary is paid on US payroll.   This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.   No FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.   Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, health/welfare and retirement benefits.   We indicated in his employment agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.   Would it be possible to create a payroll company here in the US for arriving foreign nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a mechanism to:receive a portion of their pay in US $ into a US accountpay in FIT and possibly FICA/Medicarenot make them eligible for domestic benefitsI would appreciate you and the others I have copied looking into this.Thanks,Jane\n"

For some, it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the fact they will return to their home country to retire.   If they remain on their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method to have them pay US taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well as receive US $.Currently, David Oxley is on such an arrangement.   He is paid by the UK a portion of his pay to maintain UK benefits.   The remainder of his salary is paid on US payroll.   This allows him to pay in FIT withholding.   No FICA/Medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the UK.   Unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as they had to code the HR system not to provide him with Flex dollars, health/welfare and retirement benefits.   We indicated in his employment agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits.I am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this.

With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to other parties without change.1)   Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period, not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such review period.   This is only fair to our employees so that they know the criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.2)   The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without a bunch of red tape.   There is this idea that unsolicited input works within the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.   There needs to be an unobstructed communication line for this input.   The theory of upward feedback should also be questioned.   I have never been asked to provide input to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I have worked for that position.   Are Managing Directors exempt from this process?   This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.   How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?3)   There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the process.   There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the job function.   I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to provide input were not even solicited.   There was one individual that partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was not even asked for input.4)   What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our PRC definitions is still being debated.   It has been described by several HR representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.   Neither one of the definitions describes such performance as \"simply doing the job\".   Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not effectively and precisely rate the employee.   What we end up with in the PRC is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to pull the entire group back a notch.   With better definitions and communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be lacking.Thanks for your listening ear.\n"

This is not to say that an employee should be disciplined for raising complaints; obviously that would be retaliatory in nature.   And so, if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or old-fashioned letter with OTC, I would have no issue.   But, here, this person has sent a communication ostensibly from ECT's OTC and apparently has access to do so in the future.   In my mind, that activity must be addressed and ceased.

Unless Michelle or another opines differently, I believe it is incumbent upon us to determine who mis-used that e-mail address.   This is not to say that an employee should be disciplined for raising complaints; obviously that would be retaliatory in nature.   And so, if this person had simply left an anonymous voice message or old-fashioned letter with OTC, I would have no issue.   But, here, this person has sent a communication ostensibly from ECT's OTC and apparently has access to do so in the future.   In my mind, that activity must be addressed and ceased. I suspect that it is technologically feasible to determine the source of the message.   Unless there is objection, I would recommend an investigation (which my group can do) to determine the author.BrianDavid Oxley@ECT07/13/2000 09:59 AMTo: Gina Corteselli/Corp/Enron@Enron, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kathryn McLean/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Schaffer/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Performance Review ProcessCan we discuss below please?

With all our discussions about Communication within Enron, I am now communicating to your level issues that I have communicated in years past to other parties without change.1)   Enron needs to lay out the groundrules in total that will pertain to the upcoming review period and communicate them in advance of the review period, not during the PRC process to be applied after the performance has already occurred and upon which each employee cannot change their behavior for such review period.   This is only fair to our employees so that they know the criteria upon which they will be evaluated in advance.2)   The PRC system needs to be changed whereby any and all people that are willing to provide input on performance of any individual can be done without a bunch of red tape.   There is this idea that unsolicited input works within the system, but it requires too much effort to get throught the hurdles and it still requires that the supervisor approve such input.   There needs to be an unobstructed communication line for this input.   The theory of upward feedback should also be questioned.   I have never been asked to provide input to my direct boss (President of Houston Pipe Line) in all the years that I have worked for that position.   Are Managing Directors exempt from this process?   This issue is also addressed in #3 below in a different manner.   How can appropriate feedback be given if those that work directly with individuals are not given the opportunity to communicate?3)   There is still way too much preferrential selection of reviewers in the process.   There should be set out for each employee a listing of absolute minimum reviewers (certain people) that must be solicited, depending upon the job function.   I have seen too many circumstances where the obvious people to provide input were not even solicited.   There was one individual that partially worked directly for another during this past review period and was not even asked for input.4)   What constitutes an average employee and what that category is within our PRC definitions is still being debated.   It has been described by several HR representatives that it is either/and both Strong or Satisfactory.   Neither one of the definitions describes such performance as \"simply doing the job\".   Because of such confusion, the reviewers when they provide input do not effectively and precisely rate the employee.   What we end up with in the PRC is an over-inflated representation of each employee and the committee has to pull the entire group back a notch.   With better definitions and communication to our employees on how to interpret the definitions, it will give us a better process and set the standards in writing that seem to be lacking.Thanks for your listening ear.\n"

I remember that you wanted to be included, but somehow, as I was trying to get away for vacation, I failed to remember to tell Twanda, who was setting up the meeting.   I apologize for the oversight --- it was not intentional.   I will make sure that you are included in any subsequent meetings.   I am sorry about this one.   Basically, the discussion revolved around the purpose of the PRC --- is it a compensation system or a feedback system?   Because the process tries to address both, there is a tension between the organization's interests (comp, promotion, etc) and that of the employee (feedback, development, etc.)   This tension is really reflected by the current categories and descriptors and the fact that we have a comparative rating system.   This tension has given people lots of heartburn.   To address this tension and to provide an immediate tweak that doesn't create too much change, Gina is going to draft new descriptors that reflect that comparative nature and also that reflect a more consistent view of how we evaluate employees.   The preference was to go to numbered categories instead of a descriptor because of the possible disconnect between the descriptor and the comparative rating.   For example, a \"strong\" performer really could be excellent, but compared to others in the group, ended up in the third category.   For this reason, the descriptor identifiers were found to be problematic.   Also, there will be a revamping of the explanations of the categories to get away from the old \"HR\" language.   For example, a category 1 performer would have a descriptor that said something like:   \"Always raises the bar; franchise player,\" etc. rather than a \"HR\" definition relating to demonstrating criteria.   Also, people had the view that needs improvement and issues probably should be collapsed because there wasn't much difference between the two.There was a general discussion about whether going to numbers made it seem more competitive.   Also, there was discussion about the fact that the PRC appeared to be a \"black box,\" and the desire to explain and communicate more about the process.This was only the first meeting.

We would like to bring them back to   do light-duty work, to get them in the swing of working again and also   to get some adminstrative work done.   I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light   duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than   an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and   employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the   liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought   them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE   HURT HIMSELF AGAIN.   In which case, GSP owns it.   However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the   worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement.   He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return   to work from worker's comp.   I know that we have an ongoing dispute   about worker's comp with MG at this point.   What would be your   recommendation on bringing these employees back to work?   As a bit of additional info, one of the two employees seems eager to   come back . . . the other one does not.

I don't know the details of this one, but if you get the Buyer to agree it is very generous for the employee.   Regarding Pension Plan, if you get Dee the list of employees, we can get an idea of the unvested amounts by employee.   Since this appears to be an asset sale, Enron can either pay this outside of the plan or consider it forfeited.ThanksCbMichelle Cash@ECT09/05/2000 08:07 PMTo: Timothy J Detmering/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Fran L Mayes/HOU/ECT@ECT, mstuart@velaw.com, Sheila Knudsen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anne C Koehler/HOU/ECT@ECT, fmackin@aol.com, Dolores Lenfest/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Barrow/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Joyce/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Privileged and Confidential---Project Triple LutzTim,Anne Koehler asked me to provide general employment terms for Project Triple Lutz.   I have spoken with persons in HR and benefits and have put together the following \"headlines\" for employee matters.   This list is a first cut, based upon my discussions with persons I could reach today; thus, it may not be exhaustive.   Details of certain issues, as described below, will have to be worked out.Of course, your team may choose to modify/delete items from this list, depending on the exact nature of the deal.   In the interest of time, however, I am sending this list to our lawyers at V&amp;E to begin drafting the employee provisions of the sale agreement, which I understand you would like to see on Thursday.   Any modifications based upon your team's comments should not be difficult.The employment provisions may include:Buyer will hire all employees identified by Seller.The hired employees will have a title that is at least the same/equivalent as their title at Enron for a two-year period after closing.Buyer will give all hired employees credit for years of service at Enron for purposes of participation in Buyer's benefits (though not accruals), thus allowing the hired employees to have immediate participation in Buyer's benefit and compensation plans (e.g., 401k, vacation eligibility, etc.).The hired employees will be paid, at a minimum, the same base salary they earned at Enron (which would include the merit increase for 20001) for a two-year period after closing.The hired employees will receive the same level of total cash compensation as their last year of Enron employment for one full year after closing (the buyer can make this happen through base salary, bonus, etc.).The hired employees will receive benefits (e.g., health insurance, life insurance, etc.) that are comparable to those they had in their last year of employment with Enron (although we probably will have some discussions over our sick leave policy, which is generous).Buyer will retain severance benefits at Seller's level for one year after closing, after which the hired employees will be eligible for severance under the Buyer's plans (with credited service).Before Buyer terminates the employment of a hired employee (other than for cause --- to be defined), Buyer shall inform Seller, which will have the right to re-employ the employee at Enron, with credited service.For employees with less than 5 years of service, some concession for unvested portion of Cash Balance Plan may be necessary.Open issues/questions include:Equity:   What is to be done with unvested equity?   For example, in December, every Enron employee will be granted stock options worth 25% of their base salary (based on the Black-Scholes valuation).   Also, persons with other equity grants may forfeit those grants upon closing.   An evaluation of the various plans and participants will be necessary to determine exactly where any issues exist, as well as possible resolutions of those issues.   In light of the appreciation in Enron's stock, this equity issue may be significant.Pension:   What will happen to hired employees with potential eligibility under Enron's pension plan?If you have any questions about these issues, please give me a call at x 3-6401.   If I receive additional feedback, I will let you know.Thanks.Michelle \n"

We would like to bring them back to   do light-duty work, to get them in the swing of working again and also   to get some adminstrative work done.   I am concerned that bringing these employees back to work on light   duty will cause these cases to become an Enron liability rather than   an MG liability. I discussed this with Pat McCarthy, the labor and   employment law attorney we are using in NJ, and he said that the   liability would typically not transfer to GSP just because we brought   them back . . . it would still be an MG liability, UNLESS THE EMPLOYEE   HURT HIMSELF AGAIN.   In which case, GSP owns it.   However, Pat said that a lot of what determines the ownership of the   worker's comp cases is written into the purchase and sale agreement.   He said that there may be language that addresses an employee's return   to work from worker's comp.   I know that we have an ongoing dispute   about worker's comp with MG at this point.   What would be your   recommendation on bringing these employees back to work?   As a bit of additional info, one of the two employees seems eager to   come back . . . the other one does not.

This is where an agency employee claims that he/she was treated like an employee, therefore he/she should get employee benefits (vs. benefits from the agency company, which are probably weak).   Since we did a share purchase of MG, if the agency employees filed a suit against MG claiming that they are really employees, I think that we would have to defend it.I am not an attorney, but I am going to send this to Michelle Cash, who can advise us on the position we should take.   I would think that if we single out certain employees to become Enron employees and the remainder stay as agency employees, this would enhance the legal position of the agency employees (versus everyone staying as an agency employee).   Michelle, can you help us with this one?   Thanks.Melissa, I also think we should minimize distribution on this discussion . . .   \tEnron Europe \tFrom:   Melissa Laing @ ECT   08/08/2000 10:57 AM To: Hoyt Thomas/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Jeanie Slone/LON/ECT@ECT, Melanie Doyle/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Henry Bath LAHi Hoyt,I have today spoken to Ed Dablin regarding Henry Bath LA.   We discussed how the employees seem to feel that they are Enron employees, although they are infact agency workers.   Ed confirmed that Martha and half a dozen other employees quite clearly should become Enron employees and should get applicable benefits.The other employees (who are mainly manual employees) he does not feel should become Enron employees and should remain as agency staff.He realises that the original granting of Share Options has slightly \"muddied the water\" with regard to whether these employees are employees of Enron or the agency.   He was not involved with the original decision to grant these employees Share Options.We discussed the issues (in broad terms, as I could not remember all of the specific issues) and he is aware that making a limited number of individuals Enron employees, whilst the others remain agency workers, is not an easy thing to do.   However, this is his ideal scenario.   How viable is it that we can do this for him?He also made the point that Martha is the most senior executive in Henry Bath Inc. and is one of his most valuable employees.RegardsMelissa\n"

It looks like there may be some key personnel we want to employ, but that there are many whom we don't want to hire.   I am not really familiar with the specific facts here.The question of a joint employer arises when a company treats its contract personnel like its own --- by setting compensation, controlling their activities, engaging in promotion/discipline/termination, etc. decisions, and other ways in which an employer treats its own employees.   So, if the plan is to have workers doing the same thing, with one as a contractor, and one as an employee, there could be some issues, particularly if they share a supervisor.   Unfortunately, that often is the case with contract personnel.If there are distinctions among the various responsibilities of these workers --- and like workers are treated similarly --- the risk may be reduced.   It is cleanest, however, to use all of these workers through the contracting agency for a while (assume we don't want to hire them all, which is the other alternative).   Then, the company may want to make selected offers to people who may be in a managerial role or have some other distinction from the bulk of the contract workers.I would like additional information on this situation before reaching a definitive conclusion.   So, let's try to discuss it.   I am booked until about 111 this morning, but am available after that.MichelleHoyt Thomas@ENRON08/08/2000 04:21 PMTo: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Melissa Laing/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Priviliged and Confidential communication to my attorney Re: Henry Bath LAMichelle, I guess emails will get to you sooner if I remember to add you to the addressee list!

These kinds of representationsare not in the Agreement.The bottom line is that the buyer needs to rely on Canadian counsel andactuaries to gives buyer the level of comfort it desires to have with respectto these issues of funding, compliance and administration so that they can beinserted into the financial model for determining the offering price.You may wish to obtain a formal opinion letter from the Canadian counsel andactuary regarding the level of comfort the buyer requires.Pat\n"

If a form ofindemnity is required, make it very broad to cover all risks, including, butnot limited to, selection, unlawful discrimination and for permittingtortuous interference with employment.I assume that you have received my November 1 memo regarding Bidder D.Redlined SPA.I listened in on the labor relations call yesterday, but there didn't seem tobe anything for me to comment on.   I do have one observation about the call.While I don't know anything about the transaction, the conversation aboutemployment and benefits would have been facilitated if Enron had previouslysubmitted a written schedule of all of the documents and information Enronrequired in completing its due diligence review, and used that writtenschedule to make reference to the data that has not yet been received.Enron should not let the other side's data schedule or lack of a completeschedule control Enron's due diligence agenda.   Enron should know in advancewhat information it wants and use a check off sheet to manage the duediligence process.   That way, the other side will better understand whatEnron expectations are.I use this kind of data management tool all of the time and it is veryhelpful to be able to refer to when it was presented to the other side, howlong they have had it and what items are still missing.I heard nothing like that in the conference call yesterday.   It was thoughpeople were thinking of things as the conversation went along.Pat\n"

A couple of questions:Under the \"Come-Along\" provision [Sec. 8(d)(ii)] of the Stockholder's and Voting Agreement am I correct assuming that if ENA finds a willing buyer and acceptable price that we can effectively require/force all other shareholders to sell under the same terms, etc...?   If the terms of such a sale included non-cash items (stock, stock options, gas contracts, power contracts, tolling agreements, etc...) is it also correct to assume that those items would be valued (for the non-ENA shareholders) at \"Fair Market Value\" pursuant to Sec. 7?In some cases the discussions are elevating quickly to very senior levels and there are certain questions that are being asked and/or going to be asked relative to the Securities Purchase Agreement, Business Opportunities Agreement, JB Employment Agreement and Stockholder's and Voting Agreement.   Assuming the prospective buyer is under a Conf Agrmt, are there any restrictions to my discussing or disclosing material facts relative to these agreements and/or providing them a copy?I appreciate your feedback ASAP.RTM\n"

I have a question regarding photos on the MD/VP biographic profiles (which will be provided at the VP/MD Global meetings on 31 July and 1 Aug.   I am told that insofar as possible we should ensure photos are included on all the bio profiles--- but I also understand that there are legal considerations (i.e. we need to get employee concurrence to include the pictures).I gather that there is a disclaimer or consent form that the VP's and MD's will have to sign and wondered if you would have a copy of this consent form for me to use.   Any info you can provide on this would be greatly appreciated.   Thanks in advance. Gina\n"

Should we include the standard \"affiliate\" language for clarity and to maximize our flexibility?2.   Can you tell me the basic differences between the PWD and SSD?3.   Do we want to impose the Enron Code of Ethics referred to in para. 3a., Performance Standards?4.   I personally believe that we should delete reference to the \"Staffing Service Fee\" in para. 4b and the \"Liquidation   Table\" in para. 4c.   These type of fees/factors are subject to many outside influences and can fluctuate considerably with the marketplace.   I think that we may lose some negotiations leverage by locking any such rates in the basic contract.   Those kind of issues can still be worked on a case by case basis and incorporated into the contract by amendment, or possibly, the PWD.It looks like an efficient document, and it should save some time and effort as we progress.

If you have theri fax number, that probably would be best.   Also, I suggest that we ask CS not to identify us as a reference or to use our name in any type of advertising or publicity materials.   We prefer to keep our vendor list private.Dear Ms. Poss, Thank you for your written   request for a reference on Contracting Solutions.   It is not our practice to provide references for contracting agencies.   I would suggest that you contact another company that does business with Contracting Solutions to obtain the information you seek.   I am sure that Contracting Solutions can provide you with alternatives. By the way, I spoke with Jennifer Cronin, who had referred your call to me.

'''In some jurisdictions, we're going to see more litigation ...which lasts longer, even for employers who did nothing wrong,''' he said.But Thomas Osborne, an AARP lawyer, praised the decision as a victory for thesome 12 million over-50 workers who belong to his organization because it'''says employers no longer can lie about their personnel decisions and getaway with it.'''The playing field is no longer slanted toward employers,''' Osborne said.In a series of employment-bias decisions, the nation's highest court hasimposed various requirements on employees who say they were treatedillegally. They must show they were subjected to adverse treatment and thatthe employer's asserted reason for such treatment was phony.But federal appeals courts have disagreed on a key point:whether employees who discredit an employer's stated reason must also offerproof of a discriminatory motive. Not always, the Supreme Court said Monday.Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote that a federal appeals court wrongly reliedon '''the premise that a plaintiff must always introduce additional,independent evidence of discrimination.'''Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simplyone form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentionaldiscrimination, and it may be quite persuasive,''' she said. '''In appropriatecircumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer form the falsity of theexplanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatorypurpose.'''O'Connor said employees will not always be entitled to win a job-bias lawsuitafter showing that an employer's explanation for their treatment was false.But she ruled that it was enough in the case of a Mississippi man who saidage discrimination cost him his supervisory job at a toilet-seatmanufacturing plant.Roger Reeves sued Sanderson Plumbing Products of Columbus, Miss., after hewas fired in 19995 from his job as a hinge-department supervisor in the plant.Reeves, then 57, had worked at the plant for 40 years.His lawsuit invoked the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and ajury awarded him $70,000 in damages and $28,490 in lost pay.But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out that award after rulingthat Reeves had not offered enough proof of illegal age bias.Reeves had been required to prove he was over 40 and therefore protected bythe federal law, that he had been fired and replaced with someone younger.Such evidence amounted to what courts call a '''prima facie''' showing ofdiscrimination.Sanderson Plumbing then was required to offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatoryreason for the firing. Once it did, the burden shifted back to Reeves to showthat the stated reason was false.He also pointed to derogatory comments made about his age by a supervisor.Company officials said Reeves had been fired for falsifying time records buthe showed that he had not.The jury apparently concluded that he succeeded in proving bias, but theappeals court said Reeves had to also offer proof that the company's decisionwas motivated by age bias.Monday's decision said the appeals court was wrong about that, and reinstatedthe jury's verdict.AP-NY-06-12-000 15222EDTCopyright 2000 The Associated Press.

I do not know how your management would feelabout a letter of proposal, which would serve as a temporary workauthorization until the final contract is in place but it is something thatESC is willing to do.   Assuming Ms. Cash is able to pull together the MasterService Agreement by Monday and everything is agreeable to ESC then itobviously would not be necessary to implement a temporary workauthorization.   However, should we run into further obstacles, I wanted toshare with you this possible opportunity.One of the things that I wanted to discuss with you is your remainingstaffing requirements.

The data should include age and title of persons offered packages, and then a separate list of age and titles of persons who are not offered packages.Once this data is pulled together, I will be happy to review it to ensure compliance with the Older Worker Benefit Protection Act, as the DOL has interpreted it.Thanks.Michelle\n"

      "body": "\nOk, you told me nothing, so I am clueless as to what is creating the distress.   Maybe we can chat later.We will not be in Austin in the next few months.   We are going to San Antonio the first weekend in March, as well as the first week in April.   The first trip is for a wedding between two friends of Trey from Rice MBA who are marrying each other.   The other is for the Enron law conference, which is Wed.-Friday.   We are not taking Cameron on either of those trips (party time!!!), so we will be rushing back to Houston right afterwards.I am working with Butch Hayes at F&amp;J.   I haven't been too involved in the matter because it is not an Enron subsidiary, but from what I can tell, I like him.   Any additional insight, if necessary, would be great.Too bad you weren't in Houston a couple of weeks ago.   But, it probably would have been a sad time for all of you, and it sounds like you don't really need that right now.   If you visit us, we promise to be cheerful and frivolous if you need it --- not that acting that way is too much of a chore for me.   Plus, Cameron acts like a 2-year-old, which is a delight.   He started at a new school a few weeks ago (The Post Oak School --- a Montessori school about a block from our house), and he is really coming into his own.   It is amazing how much my world has both grown and shrunk since he was born.   Little things like seeing a squirrel in the back yard have become major events (don't even get me started on helicopters).   On the other hand, I feel this enormous responsibility and desire to make sure that all is right with the world.   Quite an awesome sense of obligation and discovery combined.   Enough waxing philosophical.   I've got to get out of here at some point, so I'd better get back to work.Later.

We were pretty worried about Joe for a while there becauseMyra is (was?) the love of his life and he is so vulnerable. I can't rememberhow much I told you over the phone (?)Good to hear from you! We haven't been to Houston in a long time and are duefor a visit. We almost came the weekend of Feb 5-6 because a group was gettingtogether to go to Jay's gravesite in honor of his Feb 10th birthday. (But workkept me here that weekend.) Hopefully sometime soon I can get over there andsee you &amp; Trey &amp; Cameron. Any plans to come this way? I'd love to see you.For V-Day, we went out to eat at the Hula Hut. I picked up my brother Ed fromthe airport (he had been in Santa Fe with Joe for a long weekend - we aretaking turns) and Ed came with us for our nice \"romantic\" dinner. Later Rogand I went for coffee and dessert as a special treat. We still have a greattime together just talking about stuff and catching up on the day'shappenings.Hope all is going well with the investigation - it sounded like you were ingood hands with the Fulbright lawyer. (Who is it? - Brian Grieg? Butch Hayes?)If I can be of any help in any way, please let me know - I would love to workwith you! But, truly, I would   like to just see you again - to catch up and have somelaughs! mms&lt;&lt;&lt; \"Michelle.Cash@enron.com\" 02/15/000 02:333PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Maria,I got your voice mail a couple of weeks ago.   It sounded like you were a bitonthe stressed out side.   I hope things have improved, and that you had a nice,romantic Valentine's Day yesterday.   Trey and I went to the opera on Sat.nightfor our V-Day event.   We saw the Elixer of Love, which is a very light, cute,happy-ending opera (no screeching).I think we got the referrals taken care of on the Austin investigator issue.Thanks for your input.Take care, and I'll catch you later.Michelle   \n"

If you are unavailable to attend please have someone represent you at the meeting.The plan for the meeting is to:Go through individuals' findings regarding completeness of information available in data room binders, issues encountered that my impact the value of the assets to Enron, and any additional information required for Leaf River and Woodland.Provide an update regarding the status of Woodland and deal stopper issues.The issue relating to Woodland and the hesitancy to fully proceed on the due diligence relates to two potential deal stoppers --- security of fiber supply and labor union issues. Our preference was to better understand these issues before fully engaging in the due diligence process, and incurring the associated costs, but the constrained timing has limited our ability to accomplish that. At this stage it appears as though we will proceed to submit a mid-November bid, and therefore we should proceed with all necessary due diligence for Woodland.Craig\n"

I would like to propose something like the following: 1.   We provide Bidder D with a list of all Designated Employees, their position, historical compensation. 2.   Bidder D covenants to make offers to ___% of certain pools of Designated Employees e.g. commercial, operations, engineering, trading, etc. 3.   Bidder D covenants to make offers that will not allow Designated Employees to successfully claim constructive dismissal under our severance plan. 4.   Between signing and closing, Bidder D provide us with a list of Offerees - Designated Employees to whom Bidder D intends to make offers of   employment. 5.   ENA covenants that we will not interfere with Bidder D's offers (can we bind all of Enron?). 6.   If an Offeree turns down the offer (in writing) then ENA is free to continue to employee Offeree.   However, if we do not continue to employ the Offeree, no   severance is owed. The intent of the above is to encourage Offerees to take the offers - they give up severance rights if they don't - but provide us the opportunity to continue to employee anyone who is bold enough to turn it down and that we want to keep.   Also it caps our severance obligation by requiring Bidder D to specify how many offers must be made.   Bidder D is certain to want more than this but I am uncomfortable saying we can't continue to employee any of the Offerees.Please advise.\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nDavid,I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we are not dealing with Bidder D.I think it is ok legally to go this way --- although there is potential liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).   We probably can schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be affected 60 days' notice. Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.   I'd prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer.   I would like more information about what is meant by \"ENA does not interfere with\" the offers made by the buyer.   Does that mean no counteroffers? To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.   It is easier to commit only the wholesale group, rather than ask Corp., EES, Broadband, etc.   whether they will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group, if possible.   We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have been involved in this transaction.Let me know if you have any questions.MichelleDavid Oxley111/26/2000 06:50 PMTo: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Fran L Mayes/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Triple Lutz Employee MattersWhat's your view?---"

      "body": "\nMatt, Thanks for your email.   I believe that there is an agreement in place between ENA and Enron Expat Services.   In general, the contract is between ENA and the employee, if the person is an expat.   The assignment letter covers the employee's transfer to Expat Services.   We haven't usually amended/assigned the agreement over to Expat Services, because the payroll/benefits, etc. are through ENA. If there are changes to his ENA agreement, it is very easy for me to do them, and I am happy to handle it.If Mr. Slovenski is a VP level or above employee (I simply cannot remember right now), then Executive Compensation needs to be involved.I hope this answers your questions.   I have copied Sharon Butcher on this email because she has been involved with assignments/expats for several years.   If you have further questions, please reply to both of us so that we can be aware of questions.Thanks a lot.Michelle---Michelle CashEnron North America Corp.14000 Smith Street, EB 3823Houston, Texas   7770002(713) 853-6401michelle.cash@enron.comThis message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.\tMatthias Lee\t06/27/2000 03:48 AM \t\t\t To: Michelle Hargrave/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Lilian Low/SIN/ECT@ECT, Angeline Poon/SIN/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kimberly Rizzi/HOU/ECT@ECT, John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Chismar/SIN/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Re: URGENT : Employment Contract - Rich SlovenskiMichelleSubject to any views Michelle Cash has, I would be happy to assist by drafting the agreed amendments to the Rich's Contract. I understand from Lilian that changes would only be to the Annex and would not affect the main body of the Contract. I can work with Lilian on this once she is able to finalise the agreed amendments with John Nowlan. I note your advice that ENA is the correct employing entity and the intended arrangement is a secondment from Enron Expat Services to ENA.   However, your suggestion for a clause in the Contract to reference the secondment would not be sufficient to put the arrangement in place. Rather, there should be an agreement between Enron Expat Services and ENA. I believe such an agreement is likely to be in place as Rich is not the first expat here in Singapore from ENA - John Chismar and John Thomas who are here precede him. Because I do not have the background to the relevant inter-company arrangement between ENA and Enron Expat Services, I would suggest   you discuss with Michelle Cash on to clarify this issue, and perhaps make the necessary amendments to the letter of offer which presently provides that Enron Expat Services is the employer and that Rich will be expected to provide services for ENA, instead of secondment from ENA to Enron Expat ServicesRegardsMattMichelle Hargrave06/26/2000 09:40 PMTo: Lilian Low/SIN/ECT@ECTcc: Matthias Lee/SIN/ECT@ECT, Kimberly Rizzi/HOU/ECT@ECT, John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Chismar/SIN/ECT@ECT, Tim Poullain-Patterson/LON/ECT@ECT, Angeline Poon/SIN/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: URGENT : Employment Contract - Rich Slovensky   Lillian,We were discussing this with our International HR Rep and we feel that since the offer letter indicates Enron Expat Services as the employe, the employment agreement should reflect employment by ENA and we need to add a clause secunding Mr. Slovinski to Enron Expat Service.   PLEASE have Matthias make the amendments so we can get this in place as soon as possible.   I am sure that as long as Legal in Singapore makes the necessary changes it will be fine.   The important thing is to get Rich to sign the contract!You did receive the employment agreements we fed-ex'd you on June 6th didn't you?

I do not have the soft copy of the executables to make the changes nor am I sure if I m allowed to make amendments to them without legal reviewing them.Since Legal Singapore is aware of the situation, and if it is agreeable, we can make amendments to the existing hard copies and have Matthias review them.   This should expedite this.   However, we still need to know who would be the employers of Rich - ENA or Expat services.LilianMichelle Hargrave23/06/2000 21:40To: Matthias Lee/SIN/ECT@ECTcc: Kimberly Rizzi/HOU/ECT@ECT, John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Chismar/SIN/ECT@ECT, Lilian Low/SIN/ECT@ECT, Tim Poullain-Patterson/LON/ECT@ECT, Angeline Poon/SIN/ECT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: URGENT : Employment Contract - Rich Slovensky   Matthias - the executables were Fed-Ex'd to Lillian on June 6th.

We do not want to react to, and treat, the symptoms (number of absolute categories), without full consideration of the root cause and setting a plan to address it.   The real change issue as I see it is job description and \"position\" classification.   The real project is to rationalise the job structures within Enron - simplify wherever possible.   Target a cut from 24 categories to say 12.   This impacts not only the PRC, but how we look at compensation across the levels, function performed (e.g., commercial, commercial support, technical) and specialization areas (e.g.,   legal, accounting, IT, engineering, HR, etc.)With respect to current yearend PRC, it is hard to change the agreed process midstream.   It is doable if we can show where/how certain of the categories are \"equivalent\" and should be considered together.   Only caveat is to ensure we do not render the root cause untreatable by addressing symptoms.Tim / Gerry:How would you like to approach this?   Two key groups we need to link in are Compensation (Mary Joyce, Pam Butler) and PRC (Gina Corteselli, Andrea Yowman).   Let talk early next week.Regards,BobDavid Oxley@ECT09/21/2000 02:49 PMTo: Neil Davies/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Drew C Lynch/LON/ECT@ECT, Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bruce Van Cleve/HOU/EEES@EES, Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marla Barnard/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Mary Joyce/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Gilchrist/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Schaffer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sheila Knudsen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gerry Gibson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Tim O'Rourke/Corp/Enron@Enron, Pam Butler/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Andrea Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bob Sparger/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: Unnecessary Hiearchy equals 10X Bureaucracy   Tim/Gerry/Bob,Would you facilitate this discussion?DavidNeil Davies@ENRON09/21/2000 02:41 PMTo: Drew C Lynch/LON/ECT@ECTcc: David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bruce Van Cleve/HOU/EEES@EES@ECT, Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marla Barnard/Enron Communications@Enron Communications@ECT, Mary Joyce/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Gilchrist/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ECT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Schaffer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sheila Knudsen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gerry Gibson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Tim O'Rourke/Corp/Enron@Enron, Pam Butler/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Andrea Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Unnecessary Hiearchy equals 10X Bureaucracy   Commie and Capitalist It seems to me that both ideas and philosophies have merits - it is all down to how you assign value to roles - in ENA commercial deal making function this is very easy to do - how much they profit they generate - grade has very little place in this world.In other areas it is harder and grading provides a methodology (far from perfect) for grouping and providing structure around a set of skills and how they are valued in the organisation. To lose them without providing some other method of measuring value e.g. a more robust PRC process, would run the risk of making a sometimes too subjective process even more subjective.Give me a small number of loose grades anytime. So we should aim for nearer to 8/9 and head away from the 24 - having 7 levels for admins does smack of bureacracy.Would be interested to be involved in looking at thisNeil(free market radical)Drew C Lynch@ECT09/21/2000 111:41 AMTo: David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Bruce Van Cleve/HOU/EEES@EES, Robert Jones/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marla Barnard/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Mary Joyce/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Gilchrist/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Schaffer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sheila Knudsen/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gerry Gibson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Tim O'Rourke/Corp/Enron@Enron, Neil Davies/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Pam Butler/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Andrea Yowman/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Unnecessary Hiearchy equals 10X Bureaucracy   David,Obviously I missed this meeting, but Scott has been good enough to fill in some of the details for me.

Far from adding additional levels a fundamental analysis should be made of the need for any more than 5 from top to bottom. In this regard I would lay down the following challenge for your comments: why would the following structure not work better in promoting a flat, entrepreneurial, open, fast paced organisation, while also significantly reducing the bureaucracy:Number of PRC levels Commercial   Support/Technical   Key1   MD/VP   Same   Collapse 222   Deal Makers   Management   Collapse 333   A&amp;A's   Specialists/Consultants/Professionals Collapse 3/54   Admin (non- Exempt)   Same   Collapse 7!David (Commie) Oxley\n"

My task is to come up with some good verbiage for the descriptors.   I'd like to chat with Dick, if this is possible, for his additional input as I go along with this.

Also, \"loosing\" people should be \"losing\" people.One other risk is that the descriptions of what people are doing could reveal confidential business strategies to our competitors because there is no filter on what employees can/can't put.   In other words, if an employee is working on developing something within Enron that our competitors do not know about, expertfinder could provide them with that data/strategy.One other recommendation (by Scott) was to allow access only from an Enron facility --- not remotely.   This would manage risk of a person taking a laptop to a competitor and also would protect against hackers.Given that employee talent is a major asset, we should find ways to move that talent around while also protecting it from being picked off from the outside.Thanks.Michelle\n"

He agreed that settlement of this type of liability by PGE in the amounts discussed would not be material to PGE (even settlements with a broader group of individuals).   Payments made by PGE prior to the closing should not have any impact on Sierra's ownership of PGE or the value of PGE after closing.   Enron has the right to dividend net income out of PGE before closing (up to certain limits).   Payment of liabilities would probably reduce the amount that Enron could dividend before closing.   Its not clear whether or not   the materiality standard was intended to be material to PGE and PGH II taken as a whole.   The amounts could be material to PGH II, but we assume that this would not be paid out of PGH II.   I believe that the benefit plan at issue here is sponsored by Portland General Holdings, Inc.   That entity is not being sold to Sierra Pacific Resources.   I do not know whether or not there will be any employees that participate in that plan after PGE and PGH II are sold to Sierra.   Sierra will cause a new plan with similar benefits to be adopted at the time of the sale for PGE and PGH II employees.   I suppose that the plan sponsored by Portland General Holdings, Inc. might be terminated following the sale of PGE.Please call me if you have further questions regarding the Stock Purchase Agreement between Enron and Sierra Pacific Resources.\n"

The problem we are having deals with employees who rotate shift.   Please review the following scenario.For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the Night (N) shift.   M T W Th F SREG   8 8 8 8 8 OT   8 SHIFT   N N D D D D Interpretation 1The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows:REG   $4000SHIFT   16OT   124.80   (((4000+16)/40) x 1.5)Interpretation 2Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as follows:REG   $4000SHIFT   16OT   120.000 (4000/40 x 1.5)Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have totally missed the boat on both of them?Thanks for your help,Diane\n"

I raised the issue of a reasonableness test regarding place of work and whether we should include some wording.   I was advised that it was not required as it is implicit.Clause 7.   They will include a no obligation to award an increase sentence.Options, bonus and sign-on wording will be the ENE wording.Clause 8. I asked to have wording made clear that it was \"... otherwise as required by the Company...\"Clause 9.   This will only apply to more senior levels.   The para will be omitted where overtime is relevant and this will be covered under work rules and be the statutory amounts.Clause 10.   We agreed to go flat rate for holidays although we did discuss a two level approach as 20 days is generous for non managerial staff who will not use it all anyway.   You and I need to agree on this.Clause 13.   I was right, it does read that we can only terminate for just cause and even then it is difficult to prove (there is a case that states that mere incompetence does not constitute Just Cause).   The definition examples are those recommended by the Lawyers although they are going to take up with them a couple of my suggestions to get their view.   Again I will talk you through this.   As far as employees giving notice, the statutory limit is 2 weeks so the period in the contract is a moral agreement only, although this is taken more eriously in Japan than elsewhere.   We also discussed the exec agreement concept which they think will not work but are reviewing the wording with their lawyers.Clause 19.   Although in the template, they would recommend including it as part of the normal terms and conditions so we need to wait for their comments on the exec agreement.They are revising template for tomorrow morning.Work RulesFairly standard and not required initially.   They are working on a draft for us to review and comment on.Benefits including PensionThey agree with our selection of benefits although they recommend a lump sum allowance type all employee pension plan which is   a book reserve which pays out on termination based on salary and length of service.   This is very common and supplements the Government pension scheme.   This would in in addition to SRAP and they are sending me more details.IssuesCorporate/Employment Filings.   They mentioned that there are a number of filing requirements that need to be done to get businesses underway.   Do we know what we have doen to date on this front?Options.   Although these schemes are common there is a lot of legal prep work involved so I intend to see if Enron Corp HR has started this with Japn, if not I will get it rolling.Expat Contracts.   They would like to review our expat contract terms, can you provide these or do I have them?I will call you to discuss.   Ihave another conference call with them tomorrow morning.\n"

Here are my comments:1 - I think this needs to be a UK form contract rather than US. Otherwise I think it is difficult for me to mainatin all the UK benefits (Pension, share plan etc.,). All numbers bar base can stay in US$'s. The Base will need to be translated at 1.5 into UKpds (ie pds150,000 then the car allce subtracted pds10,8000 and shown as such) and state in the contract how much should be paid on US payroll and how much in UK (my current arrangements allows me to keep about pds6000 per month paid in the UK so I can pay UK bills). I am happy to prepare a draft of this is you wish for Michelle and John Chapman to review.2 - I'd like confirmation that new base is effective June 1, 2000. This is when we started these discussions.3 - The cash retention amounts of pds45,000 are missing. We agreed this would be paid 3/01 and 3/02.4 - There are 3 stock option grants on appendix A of $1000k each, but I believe we agreed $120k on signing and $120k 6/01. Additionally given you were uncomfortable with additional base bump in Jan 01 I suggested we add that $25k to the second option grant making it $120k in options on signing and $145k in 6/01. Incidentally, can we make these clearly 5 year options with standard vesting (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).5 - On Bonus targets, can we insert top 25% as a VP, top 50% otherwise, after each target.6 - On ENE LTI awards, I believe we agreed this years award of $3000 would be guaranteed. For 01 I would like again wording saying \"as a VP\" inserted after 25% target and top 50% otherwise.7 - Not sure if we need to but obviously the Relo memo might need to be referenced with regards to this not being the sole agreement etc.,ThanksDavid\n"

Thomas at GARFIELDDate:   111/3/000 7:17 AM   Jim Burkhead: Dave (Syracuse) and Marty (Miami Ohio) are both going to   campus on the 14th.   If you could move your date at Maine up to that   week from the 29th, then we could convene after all three interview   trips and decide who we want to bring on-site.   I propose (based on Marty's suggestion) that we try to bring all our   leading candidates in for a mill visit on the same day (or perhaps one   day for Dec grads and one day for May grads, if we get that many   interested candidates), preferably the last week of November.   It will   be a busy day, but then we can knock it all out then.   Regarding your campus visits, we are looking for at least two process   engineers, December grads are fine (actually preferred at the present   time), and we should also look at environmental engineers if they are   available at the school you are visiting.   In order to hire two   process engineers, we probably have to bring eight in for a mill   visit.   Margo, is there any way we can get some GSPCLLC brochures or handouts   for Jim, Mary and Dave to use on campus?FYI, Houston Legal is recommending that we do not emphasize the Enronconnection.   I think that we are probably okay with the reference to Enroninthe attached blurb that Marty and Dave put together (attached) but let'savoidsuggesting to candidates that they can hire on here and then move intoEnron.Jim and Marty, when you send the attached doc to campus, you might want toaddyour name at the bottom in addition to Dave's to make sure that thestudentsknow that they can contact you.David Howe and Mike Parker, do you want to go to any of these campusvisits?Thanks, Hoyt___ Forward Header___Subject: Re[2]: Process EngineerAuthor:   David Freeswick at GARFIELDDate:   111/3/000 12:31 AM   Hoyt;   I'm scheduled at Syracuse Nov 14.
