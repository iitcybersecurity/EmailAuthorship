I intend to keep the heat on them and fully anticipate they will - at some point - transact.Thanks Again,Dave Fuller503-464-3732\n"

I look forward to working with you once again.In light of the upcoming addition to our wholesale energy business, thisemail confirms our request to establish a gas purchase and sale agreementbetween your organization and Constellation Power Source, Inc.(\"CPS\").According to our business structure, our affiliate company in Houston, TX,Constellation Energy Source, Inc.(\"CES\"), was previously handling all of thewholesale natural gas business on behalf of our organization.   It isexpected that CES will cease operations by April '01 and the wholesale gastrading activity will be conducted through our newly formed Gas Desk locatedwithin the CPS' offices in Baltimore, MD. I have already contacted CES in anattempt to gather contracts and determine whether an assignment or thetermination and reissuing of a new agreement between us would be the mostfeasible mean to proceed with our gas trading activity in a timely fashion.ENA   has been identified by our Gas Desk as one of the potentialcounterparties for gas trading in the year 20001.   CPS will initiate gastrading as early as January 29th, 20001. Considering this, I am lookingforward to receiving a copy of your master agreement for our review andconsideration.   Such can be forwarded to me via email at the earliestconvenience.I thank you in advance for your assistance and prompt response to ourrequest and look forward to working with you in the near future.   Do nothesitate to contact me if there are any further inquiries to this request.I will make a note to follow up with you during the first week of January'01.Regards,Vangie McGillowayManager, ContractsConstellation Power Source, Inc.111 Market PlaceSte 5000Baltimore, MD   21202-4035Phone 410-468-3798Fax 410-468-34999email   vangie.mcgilloway@powersrc.com \n"

I'd also like to terminate the two GTC contracts listed as well.   Client Services needs to clear up this issue very soon and I'd like Legal to sign off on the terminations.Please don't hesistate to call me at x30569 or Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan at x314443 if you have any questions or need further information.   Thanks!---",
        " Stacey Richardson/HOU/ECT on 04/12/2000 02:000 PM --- From:   Stacey Richardson   04/12/2000 02:02 PM\t   To: Tricia Truong/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Connie Sutton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Hall Energy Company/Willis Enterprises Corp.Tricia,I've uncovered some troubling information regarding the issue with Hall Energy Company and Willis Enterprises Corp. based on the info you sent me.   Apparently, at one time, Enron was assigned a Committed Reserves contract with Hall Energy Company (Global #960003960) originally signed 05/07/84, effective with first production 10/04/84, that is still effective.   Two deals were entered in Sitara under this contract, covering 02/98 and 04/98 production.   From 05/98 production on, deals were tied to a GTC Purchase Spot contract (Global #96014936).   I'm not sure why the GTC was set up when we had a purchase contract already in place; it appears that this GTC covers the same well (Stewart #1) that the Committed Reserves contract covers.   Not only that, but a point was set up under the GTC (we don't set up points under GTCs, only under Committed Reserves).   It was the same point under the Committed Reserves contract.   Also, later deals entered in Sitara even include this exact meter used for the GTC.You also included documentation from Hall authorizing payments to Willis.   I've reviewed all contract and correspondence files for this contract and can find absolutely NO documentation showing that Willis in an interest owner in this well.   Do you have any division orders or other assignments showing that Willis has an interest in the Stewart #1?   If that's the case, I can add Willis as a seller under the Committed Reserves and we can have all deals moved to the original contract.   However, Willis still will not receive a separate payment.   Enron will only issue payment to the counterparty on the contract (the operator) so Willis will have to receive payment from Hall.A GTC Purchase Spot contract (Global #960007659) was also set up for Willis Enterprises Corp.   That could technically have been for separate purchases, but more recent deals in Sitara show that these purchases were from the same meter point for the Stewart #1 that the GTC for Hall used.   I can find no documentation on either of the Hall or Willis GTCs to reflect that these were set up to handle different wells than the one in question.   Without any other paper, it is my guess that both the Hall GTC (96014936) and the Willis GTC (960007659) were set up in error.   The people responsible for setting up the contracts are no longer around and would probably not remember anything if they were.   I would like to run this by Legal, but my inclination is to cancel both GTCs and settle under the Committed Reserves contract set up originally for Hall.   I will forward this information to Legal to see how to proceed.I know all this is confusing, but please let me know if you have any additional documentation from Willis or if you have any questions.   I will turn this matter over to Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan (who handles the \"H\" counterparties) and she will let you know the outcome.   Of course, you can always call me with questions, but this is really her domain since the contract in question is with Hall.Thanks,Stacey   x30569\n"

      "body": "\nENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENTGUARANTY AGREEMENTSAMPLE   FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY This Guaranty Agreement (this \"Guaranty\"), dated as of ___, is made and entered into between ___, a ___ corporation (\"Guarantor\"), and ___, a ___ ___ (\"Contract Party\"). WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ___, a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor (\"Obligor\"), are contemplating entering into an ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the \"Gas Contract\"), (ii) Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (ii) as a condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract. NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, Guarantor agrees as follows:   1.   PAYMENT GUARANTY.   Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract (the \"Obligations\"); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.   This guaranty of payment is a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas Contract (the \"Indemnity Period\").   With respect to any Claims threatened or filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.   No notice of the Obligations or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations or any Transaction.   Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, (ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (ii) action be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.   Specifically, without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (ii) an action separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity.   The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning which Guarantor is the principal obligor.   To the extent Obligor shall fail to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.   The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to time of any of the following:   (i) extensions (whether or not material) of the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas Contract or the Obligations, (ii) except for applicable statutes of limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, (v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (vii) the failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.   Upon 30 Days written notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and delivery.2.   MAXIMUM LIMIT.   The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed $___ (the \"Maximum Limit\"); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or other enforcement against Guarantor.   The Maximum Limit shall not be affected by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or application of any collateral by Contract Party.3.   DEFENSES.   Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.   Guarantor WAIVES all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.   4.   DEFAULT.   If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby WAIVES.   5.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.   Guarantor represents and warrants that:   (i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this Guaranty and (ii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.6.   FINANCIAL INFORMATION.   At the written request of Contract Party, Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information described in Appendix \"1\" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in accordance therewith.7.   NOTICE.   All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, or sent by facsimile, as follows:To Guarantor: ___Facsimile:   ___To Contract Party:___Facsimile:   ___Notice given by personal delivery or mail shall be effective upon actual receipt.

Any party may change its address to which notice is to be given hereunder by providing notice of same in accordance with this Section 7.8.   LAW, WAIVERS, MISCELLANEOUS.   THIS GUARANTY SHALL IN ALL RESPECTS BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS.

Those members forwhom we do not have an e-mail address will continue to receive theirnotices by regular mail.Keeping the above in mind, please make sure that you print the attachedmeeting notice as an extra reminder to yourself to sign up for the luncheonsince you won't be receiving the hard copy in the mail.   We hope that youapprove of this method.   If you have friends in mind that you think wouldbe interested in attending our next luncheon on February 14, please forwardthe attached luncheon notice to them.Additionally, the Board also voted to begin publishing the WEN newsletteron a quarterly basis rather than bi-monthly.   We look forward to sendingyou your next newsletter in April.For your information, we will be sending a survey to you in the near futureto gather your input about suggestions for making WEN even better.   Wevalue your opinion, so your responses to the survey will be greatlyappreciated.Don't forget that we will be having a Networking Happy Hour for all WENmembers on Thursday, February 1, at Mesa Grill, 1971 W.

When we received the Transaction Agreement dated June 10,1999, I began calling regarding the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreementdated November 1, 19993, stated therein.   I could find no such agreement inour files.On July 28, 1999, Karen Lambert faxed this Agreement. I then realized thatEnron was utilizing an Agreement which had not been assigned to Cabot in itsmerger with Washington Energy Resources Company in May 19994.   I tried onseveral occasions to explain the situation.   Finally on October 24, 2000 wereceived the above referenced Agreement originally effective October 1,2000.   We then requested the effective date to be July 1, 1999 to encompassthe original transaction along with the three (3) additional transactions.See the attached sheet for specific deal information. &lt;&lt;GC1115.xls&lt;&lt;Hope this helps.   I have submitted the master agreement for execution andwill let you know when it is on its way.   Thanks.Laurie - GC1115.xls\n"

      "body": "\nENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENTGUARANTY AGREEMENTSAMPLE   FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY This Guaranty Agreement (this \"Guaranty\"), dated as of ___, is made and entered into between ___, a ___ corporation (\"Guarantor\"), and ___, a ___ ___ (\"Contract Party\"). WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ___, a wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor (\"Obligor\"), are contemplating entering into an ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the \"Gas Contract\"), (ii) Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (ii) as a condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract. NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, Guarantor agrees as follows:   1.   PAYMENT GUARANTY.   Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract (the \"Obligations\"); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.   This guaranty of payment is a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas Contract (the \"Indemnity Period\").   With respect to any Claims threatened or filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.   No notice of the Obligations or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations or any Transaction.   Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, (ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (ii) action be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.   Specifically, without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (ii) an action separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other person or entity.   The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning which Guarantor is the principal obligor.   To the extent Obligor shall fail to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.   The obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to time of any of the following:   (i) extensions (whether or not material) of the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas Contract or the Obligations, (ii) except for applicable statutes of limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, (v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (vii) the failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.   Upon 30 Days written notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and delivery.2.   MAXIMUM LIMIT.   The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed $___ (the \"Maximum Limit\"); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or other enforcement against Guarantor.   The Maximum Limit shall not be affected by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or application of any collateral by Contract Party.3.   DEFENSES.   Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.   Guarantor WAIVES all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.   4.   DEFAULT.   If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby WAIVES.   5.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION.   At the written request of Contract Party, Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information described in Appendix \"1\" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in accordance therewith.7.

If at any time and from time to time during the term of this Agreement (and notwithstanding whether a Triggering Event has occurred) the Termination Payment that would be owed to a Party in respect of all Transactions then outstanding should exceed $___, such Party as the Beneficiary Party may request the other Party to establish a Letter of Credit as the Account Party in an amount equal to the Termination Payment in excess of $___ (rounding upwards for any fractional amount to the next $___), or such other collateral as may be reasonably acceptable to the Beneficiary Party.

Draw it up in duplicate and mail itout to me (I'm attaching a \"Notices\" sheet for you to use in preparing it).Your Credit Department can contact our Alan A. Babp, Credit Risk Analyst, atPhone: 610-7774-6129 or email: aababp@pplweb.com.   OR they can go directly toour web site (ww.pplweb.com) and click on \"Building Shareowner Value\", whichwill take them to our financial information page.Debra, we also prefer to be the confirming party, but have become enamored of\"Both\" since it forces our Trading Controls to compare our Confirmationdocument with your Confirmation document. As a matter of interest, the existingGISB we have with you, dated June 1, 1999, does in fact have \"Both\" partieslisted as confirming parties and your office prepared that document.Your netting language is acceptable.You and I know that the disclaimer states that the GISB is intended forInterruptible transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and thatit does apply to the Enron contract.   However, we have 141 other contracts thatare used for Firm transactions of up to one year (which is the maximumallowable period the Fuel Trading group can commit to without higher, VicePresidential, approval and signature.   So, if we have the time periodspecified, as I suggested, in the Special Provisions we have a much betterchance that our Traders will remember which contract to use, our data entrypersonnel will cite the proper contract and, if not, our Trading Controlspersonnel will spot and correct any that sneak by. So if it is just amatter of resistance to duplication, I ask that you \"bite the bullet\" for Iwould appreciate it if we could have the language included.Thanks for your response.Gary E.

I notice wecurrently have a Master in place with PPL Gas Utilities?In response to your previous e-mail my comments   are as follows:We cannot agree to both parties confirming.   ENA prefers to be theconfirming party.Section 13.5   NY law is fine.Our netting language is a stated below:In   the   event   that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount inthe   same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party maybe   aggregated   and   the   Parties   may   discharge   their obligations to paythrough   netting,   in   which   case   the   Party,   if   any, owing the greateraggregate   amount   may   pay   to   the other Party the difference between theamounts owed.Your   suggest to stipulate a 30 day limitation on usage for the contract isnot   necessary   as this condition is stated at the bottom of the first pagein   the   disclaimer.   With   regards   to   limitation,   we   do   not   limittransactions to one year.(See attached file: Sam3102.doc)Finally, with regards to the Master, our credit department will need tospeak to someone in your office for credit information.Best regards,Debra PerlingiereEnron North America Corp.Legal Department14000 Smith Street, EB 38885Houston, Texas 7770002dperlin@enron.comPhone 713-853-7658Fax   713-646-3490 - EPlusIn2.doc\n"

This being said, I have attached an amended credit worksheet that highlights in Red the changes I would like inserted in the Master.   Please make these changes.   You will notice that I have increased Markwest's collateral threshold to $1MM and have agreed to both of their proposals to amend the Third Party Debt and the Collateral Multiple amount.   Also, with respect to their request to amend Section 4.2, section (ix), I would like to know how they define 'borrowed money' and if this change is going to be representative of Markwest, then why is it not bi-lateral.ThanksRussell ---Original Message---From:   Perlingiere, Debra   Sent: Thursday, March 222, 20001 1:32 PMTo: Diamond, RussellSubject: Markwest Master Firm Purchase/Sale AgreementPlease look at the attached and advise as soon as possible.Thanks!

I have based the EES Master Worksheet off of the ENA Master Worksheet to remain consistent.   My understanding from talking with Veronica and Russell is that this Master is not yet executed.In negotiating the ENA Master, a $60MM Enron Corp. guarantee has been issued benefiting TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.   In addition, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. has issued Enron and any of its subsidiaries a $60MM guarantee on behalf of its sub, TransCanada Energy USA, Inc.   Putting in place an executed Master is definitely the only way to go as it will allow us to net exposures between EES and the counterparty.   Please let me know how the status of the Master progresses or if you need my assistance to facilitate.   Thanks for your help. &lt;&lt; File: TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc.

Please see comments below.1. Good, please prepare the draft Master Agreement and send it to my attention. We've been doing business with Enron since 19996, so the credit reviewshouldn't be a problem.   You can probably find everything you need on our homepage (ww.pplweb.com) or call Alan Babp at (610) 7774-6129 { aababp@pplweb.com}.2. We're at a stalemate on the confirmations.   I have checked with outelectrical side and their negotiated contract with Enron uses \"SellerConfirms\".   For Gas GISB contracts while we prefer \"PPL Confirms\", we recognizethat almost everyone wants to be the confirming party so we have been accepting\"Both\".   But if you can't accept either of them, I suppose we can live with\"Seller Confirms\", since our electrical side has accepted it.   Those are ourchoices, in order of preference.3. Good, I'm pleased you agree to the \"redundant\" language.   I know it willhelp my Trading Controls people.Please advise...again, I think we're close.Gary   Shay---Original Message---From: Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com [mailto:Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com]Sent: Monday, March 19, 20001 01:000 PMTo: Shay, Gary E.Subject: Re: Enron/PPPL GISB?Gary,Thank you for your e-mail of 15 March,   my comments   are as follows:1.

We would agree to this provision with minor changes in wording.2. Agree to netting again with changes to language as follows:   In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.We do not agree with purposed revisions to the remaining sections.   As previously stated,   ENA will   consider use of   the GISB for firm delivery for 30 days or less.   This of course does not apply to interruptible service.   If you intent is for greater that 30 days of firm delivery,   I suggest we explore use of our Master Agreement in combination with a GISB or alone.   The   Master   cannot be used for interruptible service   thus the need for the GISB.Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues and how you would like to proceed.

Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/000 was moved to Sitara deal 1333958 (cannot find Tagg number).   Deal 1311153 was originally confirmed under a Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of the CP name on the deal ticket.   The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the confirm out of Tagg. I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).   I'm guessing the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.   Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.   One note:   The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have been attached to the GISB.Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard Deming.   On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able to help.   I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 1311153 (before it was split) since it's the only record I could pull up.Sorry I couldn't find you everything!SBRDEBRA PERLINGIERE05/17/20001 02:30 PMTo: Stacey Richardson/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Exxon/HPL GISB   1311153 1333958 156438 107197Debra PerlingiereEnron North America Corp.Legal Department14000 Smith Street, EB 38885Houston, Texas 7770002dperlin@enron.comPhone 713-853-7658Fax   713-646-3490\n"

I just took a practiceexam.   I consisted of 3 essays from 9-12, then a onehour lunch break, then a 3 hour performance test.   Ithink I did well on the essays, but not theperformance exam.   I pretty much spend most of mytime sudying.   this whole bar thing is quite anundertaking.   I do not know how people pass it, butthey do.   It is a lot of work and sometimes you justhit these walls, but I have rebounded prety quick.BErkely is quite an interresting place.   I have seenmore Freaks here than in Austin during college easily. It is like they bread them here.   At first, it wasfunny and I liked it, but now it has become so normalfor me to see a guy with a nose ring, and a tattoover his adam apple(Ouch!), that they are just anotherperson.   I have met some people, but I do not hand outwith people here very much.   I knew that coming here,but at times it does get lonely.The women here are quite average.   I think I was veryspoiled in Texas.   Texas women are beautiful.I am house sitting for my uncle in San Francisco forthe 4th of July weekend.   So it is a nice break frombar reviewing, bt I did bring all my books.I still think of you guys a lot.   Please tell everyonethat I say hello.So has the new parking garage been built yet ot what.Take care...Yaron ShahamFinally, because I know you would want to know, I donot have a BOYfriend, yet there was this one guy Imet, oops, uh nevermind.--- Debra Perlingiere &lt;Debra.Perlingiere@enron.com&lt;wrote:&lt;&lt;&lt; Greetings from Texas!
