In September, a film crew spent two days recording t=\rhe=20\rgroup's activities and interviewing Mark Tawney; Steven Vu, head of trading=\r;=20\rGary Taylor, head of marketing; and Brando Hayden, trader.

Under the direction of Andrea=\r=20\rReed, the group is similar to the others, with the objective of providing=\r=20\rmarket, industry, and regulatory information and identifying potential=20\rcommercial opportunities for originators and traders.   Doug Moreno and Caro=\rl=20\rMarshall are the information experts.   They are presently working to=20\raggregate all of Enron=01,s various resources into a library and a website=\r=20\r(coming soon at http:///eimfundy.dev.corp.enron.com/).   Jennifer Riley is th=\re=20\rquantitative analyst, and has already analyzed a number of statistical=20\rrelationships for the business entities to identify possible hedging=20\rstrategies.   Peggy Determeyer (steel) and Karen Carter (paper/pulp and=20\rlumber) will be providing analytical services to the two primary product=20\rlines.

J. Johnson as the starting wide receivers.&lt;Brown said sophomore Chris Simms probably will play, too, but he said&lt;Applewhite will be the starter.&lt;He also said Hodges Mitchell will continue to start at tailback, but saidhe&lt;&lt;and sophomore Kenny Hayter will alternate.&lt;\"When you play as poorly across the board as we did Saturday, you need to&lt;make some changes to try to improve what you are doing,\" he said.&lt;Brown said the team also showed a lot of spark in its first workout since&lt;the&lt;devastating loss to Oklahoma Saturday. \"They have a lot of pride,\" he said,&lt;\"&lt;and they are not pleased with the way they played in Dallas.\"&lt;The Longhorns might have four starting wide receivers because they worked a&lt;lot on the shotgun formation with four wideouts Tuesday. That has been the&lt;team's most productive formation because the Horns haven't been able to run&lt;the ball consistently and that formation gives the quarterbacks more timeto&lt;&lt;pass.&lt;Brown also   said DT Shaun Rogers, who has missed the last two games with a&lt;sprained ankle, will be able to play. He still isn't participating in&lt;contact&lt;drills, but Brown said he should be available to play at least part of the&lt;game.&lt;With Williams and Johnson moving into the starting lineup, the Horns now&lt;have&lt;three true freshmen starting because Kalen Thornton has been starting at&lt;defensive end for the last two games.&lt;Brown said he wanted to address the offensive changes Tuesday, and said he&lt;will announce any defensive changes on Wednesday. The defense had been&lt;playing well all year, but it had a bad day against Oklahoma.&lt;* * * *&lt;Texas won its first four games against Colorado, but has lost six straight&lt;to&lt;the Buffs since 1989. Brown was asked why he thinks Texas has had trouble&lt;with Colorado in recent years. Noting that Colorado won a national title in&lt;19990, Brown said, \"They probably were just better than we were in some of&lt;those years.\"&lt;Texas has not played Colorado since Brown came to Texas.&lt;The Buffaloes are a 1-point favorite over the Longhorns this year.&lt;* * * *&lt;BUFFALO NOTES: Colorado coach Gary Barnett, noting the 63-14 whipping&lt;Oklahoma put on the Longhorns, said he asked his players Monday \"How would&lt;you like to be in that (Texas) meeting room today?\" He said one of his&lt;players replied, \"Coach, we were in that meeting room a week ago.\" Kansas&lt;State had handed the Buffs their fourth straight loss the previous week. ...&lt;&lt;Colorado is one of only four schools to ever win six straight games against&lt;Texas. The others are Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M and Southern Methodist. If&lt;Colorado&lt;wins Saturday, the Buffaloes will be the only school to ever beat the&lt;Longhorns seven straight imes.&lt;* * * *&lt;RECRUITING NOTE: QB Matt Nordgren of Dallas Bishop Lynch   told me tonighthe&lt;&lt;might take until Monday to make his decision on a college choice. He saidit&lt;&lt;will probably be either Texas or LSU, with Colorado and Tennessee alsostill&lt;&lt;in the running.&lt;* * * *&lt;BASEBALL RECRUITING NOTES: Michael Hollimon, 6-1, 170,   of Dallas Jesuit,&lt;the&lt;state's top shortstop, and Ryan Olivo, 6-2, 175, of Grapevine, one of the&lt;state's top second basemen, have committed to Texas. Hollimon hit .4000 last&lt;season and also was recruited by Stanford, LSU, Baylor and Texas A&amp;M. He&lt;narrowed his choices to Texan and Stanford and committed to the Longhorns&lt;Monday night after visiting Stanford last weekend. Olivo hit .450 and&lt;blasted&lt;three home runs in summer league play with the Arlington A's. He also&lt;considered Texas A&amp;M, Texas Tech, Baylor, Kansas and Oklahoma State.&lt;* * * *&lt;My next fax will be whenever events warrant.&lt;* * * *&lt;The True Orange Fax Service includes   at   least   999 faxes   a year and costs&lt;$999 ($79 by E-Mail).

In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=\r=20\rlosses. =20\r=09\r=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 19990 and a 10-2=\r-1=20\rrun in 19995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=\r=20\rrespectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20\rLonghorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20\r=09\r=09=20\r=09\r=09\r=09Longhorn Q &amp; A=20\r=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=\rast=20\rseason) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =\ris=20\ralso no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=\re=20\rbest way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20\roffense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=\r=20\rus. =20\r=09\r=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=\rest=20\rathletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=\rd=20\rplayers, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=\r=20\rability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=\rrt=20\rRoy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=\r=20\rplay a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=\rnd=20\rHodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20\rthrough the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=\r=20\rmiss in the open field.=20\r=09\r=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=\rback.=20\rMajor Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=\r=20\rprobably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=\re=20\rto display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=\r=20\rwe are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20\rslipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20\r=09 ??? The Jackson residence=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=\r -=20\rchange coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=\rng=20\rthis team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=\ro=20\rmuch change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=\r=20\rthis Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=\r=20\rresolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=\r=20\rthe positions where problems currently exist. In 19996, Texas was No. 6 and=\r=20\rNotre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=\ren=20\rlost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=\r=20\rOklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=\r=20\ropponent, Houston.=20\r=09\r=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =\rwas=20\rthat Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=\r=20\rloss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=\re=20\rto show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20\rcould go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=\rrd=20\rteam to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=\rns=20\rare not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=\r=20\rhis team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=\re=20\rscrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20\rbeing thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. Bu=\rt=20\rchanges will have to be made constructively and gradually.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Chris Simms =20\r=09\r=09Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?=20\r=09??? Mitch Golding=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start=\r=20\rbecause he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=\r=20\rtrend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=\r=20\rsee how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =\rin=20\rhis play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20\rmiraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see=\r=20\rwhat Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20\r=09\r=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20\r=09\r=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=\rk=20\rBrown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=\r=20\rhis experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =\rHe=20\rsaid they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to =\rme=20\rthat it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig=\rht=20\rit up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc=\rh=20\rlike everyone else. =20\r=09\r=09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=\rna=20\rwith success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)=\r,=20\rBrown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t=\ro=20\rprepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20\rApplewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,=\r=20\ryou also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the=\r=20\rquarterbacks against Stanford?=20\r=09??? Nels Marshall=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Here are Brown's exact words: \"Experience. We were in a tight=\r=20\rfootball game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro=\rud=20\r- even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that =\rwe=20\rdidn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job=\r=20\rof coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look=\r=20\rlike it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too har=\rd=20\rand get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday=\r=20\rnight, it is one of those things that you have to grow from.\" =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha=\rving=20\rany problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a=20\rleft-handed or right-handed QB?=20\r=09??? Dave Stastny, Austin=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=\ring=20\rthe ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little=\r=20\rfaster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea=\rr.=20\rWhat are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=\r=20\rthat a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al=\rso=20\rapply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount =\rof=20\rtime? =20\r=09??? Chad Graham=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d=\roes=20\rnot suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20\rwindow. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Jermain Anderson =20\r=09\r=09Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b=\rack=20\rto linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa=\rs=20\rCity. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the=\r=20\rnecessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be bett=\rer=20\rsuited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the=20\rprogress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and=\r=20\rAdam Doiron. =20\r=09 ??? Micah Hurt=20\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. =\rThey=20\rare pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's=20\rinstincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop t=\rhe=20\rrun.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn=\r=20\rfootball schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard=\r=20\rTexan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h=\ras=20\rremained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner=\r=20\rfans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging abo=\rut=20\rthe Longhorns. =20\r=09??? Barbara and Mark Harper=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20\r=09\r=09Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox\r=09Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 111 a.m. on ABC\r=09Oct. 7 (in Dallas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA\r=09Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA\r=09Oct. 21 (home) vs. Missouri, TBA\r=09Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA\r=09Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA\r=09Nov. 111 at Kansas, TBA\r=09Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas A=02?at 2:30 p.m. on ABC=20\r=09Since you all have access to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site=\r=20\r(texassports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your=\r=20\rarea. And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at=20\rdallasnews.com.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me=\r the=20\rnumber of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.=\r=20\rhow's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players =\rin=20\rthe NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20\rexample, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa=\r=20\rBay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and=\r=20\rDallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota=20\rVikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted. Anyway,=\r=20\rhere is the list as provided by the Big 12:\r=09\r=09TEXAS (21)\r=09Ben Adams, OL, Miami\r=09Taje Allen, DB, St. Louis\r=09Tony Brackens, DE, Jacksonville\r=09Blake Brockermeyer, OG, Chicago\r=09Ricky Brown, RB, Cincinnati\r=09Chris Carter, DB, New England\r=09Kwame Cavil, WR, Buffalo\r=09Phil Dawson, KS, Cleveland\r=09Shane Dronett, DL, Atlanta\r=09Priest Holmes, RB, Baltimore\r=09Aaron Humphrey, DE, Tampa Bay\r=09Jay Humphrey, OL, Minnesota\r=09Derek Lewis, TE, St. Louis\r=09Wane McGarity, WR, Dallas\r=09Eric Metcalf, WR, Carolina\r=09Dan Neil, OL, Denver\r=09Roger Roesler, OL, Cincinnati\r=09Chris Smith, TE, Dallas\r=09Winfred Tubbs, LB, San Francisco\r=09Bryant Westbrook, DB, Detroit\r=09Ricky Williams, RB, New Orleans\r=09Cedric Woodard, DL, Baltimore=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Hodges Mitchell =20\r=09\r=09Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in y=\rour=20\rcolumn, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=\r=20\rwanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=\r=20\rHowever, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team \"up\" sometime=\rs=20\rand can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20\r=09\r=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =\rfor=20\rthe offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=\re,=20\rI put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=\r=20\rMitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=\r=20\rlove Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,3000-plus yards last year, but how many of=\r=20\rthose yards were \"move=20\r=09\r=09 the chains\" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=\r and=20\rprotect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=\r=20\rall we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=\re=20\rrun and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20\r=09\r=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=\r=20\rtackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=\rhe=20\rlinebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=\r=20\rwith Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=\r=20\rreceiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.\r=09\r=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=\re=20\ragainst Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=\r=20\rmay have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=\r=20\rwith opponent's wideouts.\r=09\r=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=\r all=20\rover the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=\rs=20\rup with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20\rStockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=\rn=20\ranyone at UT block?\r=09\r=09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim=\res=20\rthe camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru=\rn=20\rup the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla=\ry=20\ragainst?=20\r=09??? Andrew Bowen=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20\rincredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=\r's=20\revents. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=\r=20\rthe team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=\r=20\rother part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20\rlearning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20\r=09\r=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=\rnd=20\rneeded time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20\rfullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=\ry=20\risn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=\rd=20\rbeat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=\rs,=20\rand Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=\r=20\rabout whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=\rd=20\ron straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=\rhe=20\rteam.=20\r=09\r=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=\r=20\rquarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=\r=20\rworking hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=\rs=20\rno question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=\r=20\rthe receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=\r=20\rline. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20\rApplewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=\r=20\r=09\r=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =\rwas=20\rtaking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=\r=20\rthat. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20\rdeep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20\rblitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20\rHayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20\r=09\r=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=\r=20\rgames after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=\r=20\rThe defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=\r=20\rReese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=\re=20\rwho can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=\rut=20\rthat position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=\r=20\rone player, who blocked perfectly on 111 other punts Saturday night, failed =\rto=20\rblock a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=\rer=20\rhas been chewed out every which way.\r=09\r=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=\rn,=20\rwho did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=\ry=20\ranything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=\r=20\rhave a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=\r=20\rearly will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20\rconstructively or destructively.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=\r. I=20\rknow he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player =\rin=20\rthe country in 19998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=\r=20\rteams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M=\ry=20\rquestion is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=\r=20\rwhere he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=\r=20\rand average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20\rrecruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20\r=09??? Ernie McAnally=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=\re.=20\rBut he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=\rd=20\rright away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i=\rs=20\rperfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=\rn=20\rtime, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=\rre=20\ris no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=\rs=20\ragainst Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20\rblocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=\rnd=20\rthe next two years, he should only get better.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the=\r=20\rannouncers   stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign f=\ror=20\rLaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20\rWilliams' run for the Heisman?=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few=\r=20\rpostcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20\rmedia detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than=\r=20\r$10,000, according to UT officials.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayette =\rgame=20\rplay in the Stanford game? I am watching to see which ones might be=20\rredshirts. =20\r=09??? Mike Smith, Houston=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   According to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-T=\rexas=20\rgame, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh=\ro=20\rdid not play against Louisiana-Lafayette. In addition to Sendlein, here are=\r=20\rthe other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson a=\rnd=20\rSloan Thomas; TE Brock Edwards; DE Kalen Thornton; CB Nathan Vasher; FS=20\rPhillip Geiggar; and DT Stevie Lee.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, hi=\rs=20\rteams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost=\r=20\rfour out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week=20\rofficially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his=\r=20\rabundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5=20\rrecruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie=\rs=20\rto go with those recruiting victories. =20\r=09??? T. Hough=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i=\rn=20\rstints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20\rAppalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20\rprograms. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i=\rn=20\rthe Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl gam=\res=20\rin his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20\r=09\r=09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20\rfaithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot=\r=20\rseat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha=\rs=20\rdone beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi=\rs=20\rfirst two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination=20\rschool for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In=20\raddition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha=\rn=20\rprobably most Texas fans realize.=20\r=09\r=09Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd C=\rarr,=20\rSteve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t=\rhe=20\reyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha=\rt.=20\rUNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,=\r=20\reven when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a school with huge=20\rexpectations. He'll have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starti=\rng=20\rout the next few seasons in the Top 10.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game?=20\r=09??? Marty Bonner=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe=\rred=20\ragainst Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said=\r=20\rthis is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball=\r=20\rreally well.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is Ricky Williams' jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S=\rept.=20\r30?=20\r=09??? Mark Wilson=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Yes. Williams' No. 34 will be retired at that game. Williams ha=\rs=20\rsaid he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend.=\r=20\rHost Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams th=\rat=20\rwill be available soon.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team =\rafter=20\rthe loss to Stanford?=20\r=09??? Virginia Blair=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Again, here are Mack's words: \"I said during the pre-season tha=\rt we=20\rwere overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished=\r=20\rlast year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a=\r=20\rTop 5 football team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv=\re=20\ra tremendous amount of attention and publicity, but in some cases people wa=\rnt=20\rto push you too fast to get to the top.

I need to get an invoice to them within the next few hours as they need to settle with us on Monday.If you could go through your book and flip any deals between ENA and Duke Energy Marketing LP to the P&amp; book to settle with ECC that would help solve some problems.   Please let me know if you have any questions on this.   Just to let you know, Carole Frank took notes this morning when I walked her through running that download in TAGG.   It can be done for any counterparty in any book, so you can also run it for Duke Energy Marketing LP as well.ThanksStacey\n"

Price 5.8885   5.7772Strike Price 3.5   3.5Mid - Strike 2.385   2.272Vol.   0.555   0.555Vol. Skew 0.03816   0.03635Actual Vol. 0.59316   0.59135Option value for prior day using current day's vol. =   7,616,935   Option value for prior day using prior day's vol.   =   7,547,238 Vega   =   69,697Thank you,Jeremyx3-0573\n"

Currently Jeff Gossett is our pilot for this business unit and is testing out all applications associated with your business unit.   We expect to migrate Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week (4/4 - 4/5)As a former member of T.S.G. (TradeFloor Support Group - EB31/32) - I'm well aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with. Therefore, I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min. Profiling can begin as early as today- so here is what I ask of you: *** Please reply to this e-mail with your current location, the number of PC's you have and the number of screens/displays you have attached to each PC, as well a date/time that I can stop by. Being that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no more than a few days. *** Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.
