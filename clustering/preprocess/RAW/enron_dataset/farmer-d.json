      "body": "\nIn February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR Liquids at King Ranch.   This allocation resulted in a large physical unaccounted for loss.   Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our systems.   In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (25000 Mmbtu/day), resluting in additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract.   I have attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in February.   This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will need to be adjusted.   I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should have only purchased about 888,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for February.   See the following:Booked to HPLR Liquids: 539,574   18,606/dayPurch by HPLC @ WH:   379,108   13,073/dayIncorrect Liquids Sale:   72,5000   2,5000/day   Adjusted purch from Liquids:   87,986   3,034/dayWe usually input a purchase of 2,5000 Mmbtu/day from HPLR Liquids at the tailgate.   We can increase this to 3,000/day for March.The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch plant through HGPL.   Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC, some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the plant.   It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated correctly among parties related to these transactions.   The attached schedule should assist in doing this.   I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys wellhead gas.   The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.   A transport usage ticket can be used to show the transfer of HPLC's gas from King Ranch to HPL.Let's plan on discussing this either Friday or Monday afternoon.   Let me know what works best for you.D\n"

Please review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.   The biggest variance is in January 2000.   Cilco withdrew 2000,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.   Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.   I suspect the variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.   Also, the nomination for the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.   7,000 is the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel. ---Lisa Kinsey03/21/2000 08:12 AMTo: Kenny J Soignet/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: CILCO STORAGEKenny,Attached is the worksheet that I have been using to verify Cilco's storage balance with Vonda Seckler from Cilco.

Please remind each of your respective groups that this is not an option. Once a customer \"clicks\" on a deal, we have a valid, binding contract.   We lose our audit trail, and we can potentially expose ourselves from a Legal standpoint.   I talked to Mark Taylor about this today, and the best option is for Legal to prepare a termination agreement when we agree to let a customer out of a deal.   We (Product Control) should be notified immediately if someone is requesting to change an EOL deal.

When we get a weather report for the new day, we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.   The database is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides an average volume for that criteria.   (For example:   With temps of 40-60, the sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38 to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 222 degrees.   An average is then calculated from that volumetric data.   In this case, the average is calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)   Upon calculating the average, we then apply information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.   Things to consider:   if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;   wind chill;   Entex's obligation on Midcon;   Entex's recent operating procedures;   Entex takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating volumes each day), etc.Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to estimate the remaining 70%.   If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates more in line.Let me know if you have any questions.Daren\n"

I was forwarded this poem, and told it was written by a high school student in Az. Regardless, of who/where (not the point) I find it interesting, weirdly amusing, and frighteningly fairly accurate.- PB Now I sit me down in school Where praying is against the rule For this great nation under God Finds mention of Him very odd. If Scripture now the class recites, It violates the Bill of Rights. And anytime my head I bow Becomes a Federal matter now. Our hair can be purple, orange or green, That's no offense, it's a freedom scene. The law is specific, the law is precise. Prayers spoken aloud are a serious vice. For praying in a public hall Might offend someone with no faith at all. In silence alone we must meditate, God's name is prohibited by the state. We're allowed to cuss and dress like freaks, And pierce our noses, tongues and cheeks. They've outlawed guns, but FIRST the Bible. To quote the Good Book makes me liable. We can elect a pregnant Senior Queen, And the 'unwed daddy,' our Senior King. It's \"inappropriate\" to teach right from wrong, We're taught that such \"judgments\" do not belong. We can get our condoms and birth controls, Study witchcraft, vampires and totem poles. But the Ten Commandments are not allowed, No word of God must reach this crowd. It's scary here I must confess, When chaos reigns the school's a mess. So, Lord, this silent plea I make, Should I be shot; My soul please take!

One side of these buy/sell or exchange deals will be ratable and the corresponding partner ticket will have the optionality.Comments will include the corresponding deal number, that it is in fact a buy/sell or exchange deal and the delivery time period(3,5 or 10 days) that the counterparty desires.I hope this helps...THANKS!---",

This looks like a monthly volume that would be further refined to daily on the expected volumes once the counterparty has made their decision   (I would imagine logistics will be the one communicating with the counterparty).

Legal is in the process of drafting a GTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. I will start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Type description; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how the transaction works:Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 3000,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool IndexParty B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to take delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three forms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominated for each such day would be a percentage of the total 3000,000 MMBtu (i.e.; If Party B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the 3000,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 1000%).   Party B pay TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.I understand that this type of transaction is currently done over-the-counter. Scott Mills has previously issued an explanatory e-mail of Sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues.Bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a Sigma Factor in advance, then my turn around time to for the Product Type should be reduced. Also, due to the varying 'optionality', do you think these three different products will require three different Product Types?Please feel free to call if you have any questions.Dale3-9746\n"

Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a trueenvironmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $5000,000 of income lastyear.   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobaccowhen   he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted governmentsubsidies.   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in facthe was   placed by family influence in a \"cushy\"   correspondent's job andthe only   action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegallyraising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because theVanderbilt Law   educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sumsof political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vowsof poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to \"invent theInternet\" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeksof potentially   incriminating e-mail!   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper werethe models for the book and movie, \"Love Story\" even though the book'sauthor,   Erich Segal, says not.   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer'schampion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a milliondollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of PresidentClinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remainsilent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton \"one ofthe greatest Presidents of our history.\"   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when theywon't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record soineffective   that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH ofTennessee's   Senators!   111.   Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who willbe the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he servedto the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run downslum   house that he was renting to them.   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons aregenerally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt toactually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from theirailment, since it may be   harmful to their well-being, yours, mine andthat of the USA.   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out toaid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,   PLEASE, pass this on toyour normal   friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediatetreatment.\n"

Whoever was trying to send noms to HPL between 4:16pm and 5pm on Thursday 1/20/2000, your noms did not get uploaded into POPS.   Please re-send if you have not already.The production unix machine we process the edi noms on ran out of space.   When the machine runs out of space, it pages me, but unfortunately no data can be saved in the edi files.I was trying to free up space and after I was done (like 1 hour later, ie. 6pm), did I notice that these nom files had zero data in them.   Because they have zero data in them, I do not know what gas dates or contracts were suppose to be in the file which is why I do not know if these are ECT, HPLR, HPLC.We are suppose to get a bigger unix box installed the weekend of 2/5/2000.   This running our of space has only happened twice in the past year that I remember and that it affected the edi processes in some way on those occasions.Call me if you think these files are yours and you need some help in knowing how to re-send.-rw-r---r---   1 unifyedi aws   0 Jan 20 17:000 enom.HPL.20001201619018666-rw-r---r---   1 unifyedi aws   0 Jan 20 16:59 enom.HPL.20001201617587770Thanks, Dianex3-99931\n"

I looked at the average $/sq ft for sales in our neighborhood for the last 6 months and I was pretty high above the average.   Anyway, we got what we wanted and made a little money, so we were happy.   Two days after we sold our house, Tonya found the one she wanted in Oaks of Devonshire.   It's over at Louetta and I-45, just before The Thicket.   It's a little bigger than we were looking for (31000 sq ft), but it's got a great game room/sunroom for the kids.   It was built in 86, so it needs a little work.   But that's ok with me.   Anyway, we are closing on both houses on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.   We will have you and Linda over for lunch or dinner one of these days.   We also had tubes put into Jake's ears this month.   We hated having to do that, but it has really made a difference.   He had a constant ear infection since October.   Now you can tell that he feels so much better.   He's learning more and more each day.   We have nothing that is \"Jake proof\".   Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets don't hold him.   He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over that it will eventually slip or break and then your in.   I'm going to install pad locks on the cabinets at the new house.   We'll see if that stops him.   Anyway, everybody's doing well.   I will be alot better after we finish this house business.   I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks.   Talk to you later.D\n"

Yesterday I forwarded each of you an E-mail from Steve Van Hooser which had drafts of contracts attached.   As I talked with Brian, the King Ranch set up as he is negotiating will be simplified.   The intent, as I understood it, is that we will no longer buy at the wellhead.   Rather, Coastal is entering into a a gathering agreement with HPL to buy at the wellhead and ship to the plant.   HPLC will buy at the tailgate of the plant, net of PVR.   So there will not be future settlements with Exxon on liquids.   The paper has not been returned from Coastal or Exxon yet, but the deal is effective 4/1/000.   Everything will be under new agreements, with receipts and deliveries by different counterparties.   The gas flow continues the same, just under new contracts and different counterparties.Daren, Pat and Stella:   Daren, Brian said he would get with you to discuss the deal in further detail.   Please include Pat and Stella in the discussion also.   The contracts should be reviewed and understood to ensure proper scheduling.   As I mentioned to Greg Sharp and Brian, it is critical that we be kept in the loop, especially on retroactive deals, as scheduling, transport rates and risk are affected.Thanks to everyone for ensuring the communication lines are in place.   \n"

The CES transactions that are current on this pipe should be moved to Duke Energy Field Services.

Day 16 is not valid for deal 51862 (track id 61555), which is where 10,000 was confirmed.   The   actual sale to Adonis was 10,000 which was invoiced and paid by Adonis.   We are trying to clear the feedback error report.   My question is why was 10,000 confirmed on 1/16/999 if the date is not valid for the deal?When Karen allocates the actual 10,000 it is prorating 5,000 for each day that is confirmed (the 5th and 16th).   Should the whole 10,000 be allocated to the 5th or should 5,000 be allocated to each day?   If 5,000 should be allocated to each day, the 16th needs to be added to the deal.\n"

I have gone back into MOPS and corrected these volumes.   This should impact the UA4 number.   Also, this decreases the MidTexas cumulative imbalance.   As of 5/23 PG&amp;E owes HPL 4.649.

Their will be two buses departing at 2:45 and at 3:000 just to make sure we get any stragglers.   As soon as we arrive you will join your team members (your teams have already been chosen and there is no swapping, negotiating or shuffling allowed).   You will be notified tomorrow as we depart who is on your team and their will be signs at the bowling alley marking the lanes for each team.   Our plan is to bowl three games or until time allows.   At 5:30 we will gather for prizes and awards and depart at 6:000. Please see your admin today for your bowling shirt.   We highly encourage you to wear it tomorrow, either with jeans or khakis, whichever you prefer.   If you don't wear your shirt, you run the risk of being ridiculed by your co-workers, sticking out like a sore thumb when you bowl, or being left out of any future reindeer games (just teasing).If you have any questions please see your admin.

Attached is an organizational chart for the Texas region.   We too continue to look for efficiencies to ensure we meet the demands of our customers.   We currently support the Texas trading region, Bammel Storage Facility, Houston Pipeline, Powder River Gathering and Bridgeline.   I am pleased to announce that we will also combine Risk Management, Deal Validation and Operational Analysis under the management of Steve Venturatos who will serve as the Business Controller.   Dave Baumbach will fill the Lead position.   Ami Chokshi will move from Trading Support to the new group, continuing in the role of the Entex and TUFCO account manager.   Jody Crook also will join the team.   Bryan Hull will transition his knowledge over the next month, and will be moving to has second rotation, effective 6/5/000.   Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the Texas team as he moves to the East Region.   Transportation Management under Mary Smith will NOT be integrated into the team as their day-to-day responsibilities and projects are not cohesively aligned with this group.   Please join me in welcoming the new team members as well as the team members who will continue in the group.Mike Eiben will step in the role previously managed by Steve Venturatos which includes Global Contracts and Facilities, System Enhancements and Regulatory Reporting.   In addition, Clem Cernosek and Jennifer Pattison will be assuming new responsibilities in Logistics and Volume Management, respectively.   Both Clem and Jennifer have been on the Unify team, focused on POPS.   Please wish these folks success in their new roles.All responsibility changes are effective 5/1/000.Please share this with your staffs.   \n"

Pass on to any who may need this.In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is tagged as \"Primary\".   Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity tickets to reflect the \"other\" desks:a.   You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path Manager when building a new path.   The message will read something like   \"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 and will be removed.\"b.   Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract that you were using in the new path.c.   Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.   Then hit Copy.d.   On the new deal: Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply or Market deal that you are pathing with.   If it a deal for which we are   agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new desk.   The \"primary\" deal will carry the actual Agent.   The Agent   contract will get cleared.   Re-select the Agent Contract. Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.   Re-select the Pipeline contract. Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.   Un-check it. On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated rates, uncheck them as well.   The \"primary\" deal will carry the MDQ and   any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel. Hit Release.e.   You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.   You should see the Deal number in the Service list now read \"Multiple\".   Right-click/Service Deals will list the   specific deals.f.   Re-build the path as you originally desired.   The warning/error message should not appear again.This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.Please file this in your \"Call Dave If I Can't Find This\" folder.Thanks, d.n.\n"

This procedure is run routinely by many other users on a daily basis without incident.   At the time of the failure, this stored procedure had been running since 10:51am, or roughly 30 minutes.   I was notified via automatic page at 111:24am; the page indicating that there was 2000MB free.   I immediately checked tempdb, which was by full by this time.   Three attempts to clear the transaction log prior to 111:30am finally resulted in a cleared transaction log. Kishore noiced shortly thereafter that there was a problem in the way that Sybase was accounting for its free space, a condition which may have been crucial to the failure since nearly 5GB of space was apparently unavailable to the transaction log.

There has been some confusion concerning the Dinner Only option.   If you are planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option.   It is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.   We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the HPL Anniversary Celebration.   Please email me with the name you would like to appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc.   If we do not hear from you by Wednesday, August 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we acquired from HR.   Please print this memo for any employees who do not have access to email.Thank you so much for your help.\n"

Everyone is having problems.   Unfortunately, many ofyou are new to your jobs and did not inherit paperwork to know what your staff's salary is.   I have the averagesalary for each of the different staffing levels.   I have asked the HR department to also give methe low and the high.   Let's face it - your staff today and their salary most likely are not whatthey are going to be next year!   To much movement of people.   So using estimates and averageswill probably be as accurate as using current salary levels.Here's what you can do:1) Make a list of your staff just their positions.2) Then put down if you think I should budget high, mid, average, low, low to average, etc. You can guess at this based on their experience, length of time in that position, etc.3) Then I will calculate out an estimated salary to use for your budget.4) Here is the average: Sr. $4,961 Spec $3,964 Staff $3,026 Sr. Clrk $2,548 Clerk $2,264 Asst $3,162Your list would look something like this: Assistant Average Clerk   Very High Sr. Clerk Low Specialist Low to Average Specialist Average Sr. Specialist Average to High Analyst   (They are all allocated at the same amount)You can , however, use the exact amounts if you have them.   It's up to you.Next Item - TRAINING!!!Here's what you can do:1) List your staff and the type of class they need2) If you don't know the exact class you want to send them to, then list what type of class - for example personal enrichment (i.e. Time Management) or Technical (Derivatives or Applied Finance or Wellhead to Burnertip)3) The personal enrichment classes cost aroung $5000-$70004) The technical classes cost aroung $8000 - $1000.5) Just list the type of class, and I'll do the rest.Next Item - Headhunters!Try 20% of the new hires salary for their fees.Other Stuff - I have made a list of all of the unusual items we do during the year thatpeople forget about at budget time (i.e. flowers for secretaries day, birthdayice cream, offsite meeting costs, customer gifts).   If you forget these items, I willmake sure it is added to your budget.Once I put all of your budget information into the spreadsheets, we will review themso that they can be adjusted as necessary and you can approve them.Hopefully this helps you some.Diane x-37059   \n"

I need the contract in POPS for August forward because I never know when Copano will allocate line gain to itself.In 19998 a spot contract was set up between HPLR and Copano Pipeline/South Texas, L. P. with a Synergi contract number 078-622210-101 and a Global number of 960168880 by Karen Lambert.   Per Karen this old agreement was terminated by Dan Hyvl due to HPLR business change to ECT.   In 1999, when Copano began allocating line gain to themselves again I contacted Lauri, Karen, and yourself to see if I could get the contract in POPS.   Karen sent me an e-mail indicating that she set-up a new contract for this HPLC line gain purchase - Global # 960222367 (I don't have a \"Synergi\" contract number).   I know that in 3/999 Lauri contacted Bernard Widacki at Copano to discuss this issue.I need Lauri to review this and then I need the contract to be put in POPS so that I can correctly allocate the gas at this meter.   I have not allocated any line gain in 1999 and the volumes are small.   Karen is the most knowledgeable about this contract, so I suggest that any questions be directed to her regarding contract issues.   Karen worked with Bernard Widacki at Copano to set up the contract originally.Thanks,Fred\n"

I didn't catch this and the Deal on the HPL side appeared to be a valid flow issue for Kim Vaughn.   The plant continued to confirm this gas.We have tried working through the pipeline, but they state that they will not know anything until the 15th.   Can you contact the producer and ask them to reverify this with the pipeline?   I would like Kim to be able to zero confirm and send back to Pops so Volume Management will not allocate up to the producer level.Also I just realized that we have a committed reserve purchase agreement at the same meter with Tribo Production.   Should there have been an expected volume in this Deal?   Is it possible that Cox exploration sold their interest in this well to Tribo.

On Saturday, 01/20/01, EIM is having a Super Saturday to recruit experienced Commercial Support personnel to fill many of our vacancies.   Unfortunately, we don't have enough personnel to do the interviewing.   To round out the Logistics team, I am looking for one more interviewer.   The current team is Roy Lipsett, Dan Hamilton and Del Davis.   Both Dan and Del are new to Enron (Del started 1/8 and Dan is still transitioning his prior job and moving to Houston), but bring a wealth of Logistics experience for our industries.   I would love to have one additional team member to provide input from the Enron perspective.   Will this candidate fit into the expectations of Enron?   Will the candidate compete when compared to their peers.   Unfortunately, Logistics candidates below Manager have been difficult to find from the industry.   There seems to be a tendancy towards clerical skill sets but compensation at a Specialist level.   Consequently, I have been cautious around these candidates as I would not want to set them up to fail.I know the sacrifice of a Saturday, but I would value the input that any one of you might offer.   We do expect it to be a full day commitment as we have several candidates, and we will have a follow-up evaluation session.   I know I can't adequately compensate you for your day, but I would be happy to buy you a dinner for two.   Please let me know ASAP.   Assuming worst case that noe of you are available, I would welcome other suggestions.In advance, I appreciate your help.Brendax357778\n"

I will most likely interview with AEP to see what they have to offer, but it has to be very good in order for me to leave the Evil Empire.   I am just glad they finally anounced the sale.   Some folks are upset and concerned about the whole deal, but I'm glad it's happened.Anyway, I meant to let you know how our Christmas went with the boys.   Cole loved everything.   He had a great time and was sad to see Christmas come to an end.   Jake is a little different.   We spent $60 on a couple of things for him.   He hasn't touched them more than twice.   He found his new favorite toy the day after Christmas:   it's one of those soft cooler things you carry your lunch in.   He found that in the bottom of our pantry and now carries it around everywhere.   Now we have these two big plastic things just taking up more room in our already crowded house.We started our house hunting last week.   I think this is going to be a long process.   Tonya's out looking today.   I'm letting her make the first cut.   I will come in on the second round.   We will probably put our house on the market in a couple of weeks.   We have a few small things we want to clean up, fix, etc., before we list it.   According to the other sales in the neighborhood, we should make a little money.I hope everything is going well with you and the family.   Later.D\n"

I will try to find the meter numbers for these locations.   I don't think we will be using them much.   So, it may be a few days before I get the info together.The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-84777-01) was previously created as (1784777), I need to know if the (01) needs to be added.   Please add the 01.We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).   Is this the same point???

I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your costs from the activities to the commercial teams.   In the 'Data' tab, please select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.   If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list beginning next month.   This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.   If you would like us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next month, please let me know.   Please take this opportunity to verify the following:1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to perform these activities for each commercial team.2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified (please let us know otherwise)3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example \"Allocate 0469\" or \"80-20 Split\"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new allocation is).In reference to these surveys, please note:If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams listed in the survey, please identify them.   We will take your business support costs (such as feedback, training, etc.) and allocate them evenly among these teams.The costs for \"commercial team specific\" activities that you filled time out for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial team (e.g. Genco Support will trace 1000% of its costs to Genco).   Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.   Regards,Shari3-3859\n"

For the month of March, please provide a completed \"Hours\" survey for each position within your group.   This survey will collect the   time your team spent on performing their activities in the month of March.   NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.   If you spend time directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can add the appropriate activities to your survey.To fill out the survey:At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled \"Select Your RC\".   Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message \"Select Position from Drop Box!\" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, specialist, etc.) and \"OK\". The choices for positions are based on information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that corrections need to be made to the database).   Once you have the list of activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity listed in the column labelled \"Hours\".If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.   If you do not, the information will be lost.We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the \"Last Month\" column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).   As with last month, you have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill out the time they spent on each activity.   If there are any activities you perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.   If this is a problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.Thanks,Shari3-3859\n"

I am being asked to take a direct roll in the further development and rollout of the Operations Pricing Model (fka Transaction Cost Model).   In the past, I have directed the implementation of several pricing systems based on activity based costing similar to the Operations Pricing Model (OPM).   Over the past couple of weeks my observations of the Model have lead me to be concerned with the quality of data used in the model.   It will take efforts by both you and the OPM team to get to a satisfactory level of data quality.   This process can start with this months data collection efforts.   Please pay particular attention this month as the \"bar is being raised\" by the management of Energy Operations for data quality and timeliness.The attached survey drives your costs from your activities to the commercial teams.   Please select your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for the month of May. Please fill out the attached activity driver survey with May numbers for your RC and return to Shari Mao by end of day Friday, June 2.Please note the following updates:For Nat Gas, Sally Beck is interested in physical (as denoted as PH in the survey) vs. financial (as denoted as FI in the survey) numbers, please provide statistics accordinglyIf a driver has not been updated per your request, please call or email Jennifer ResideIf you have additional updates / suggestions or items that need correction, please call or email Jennifer ResideIf your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data, please send the report to Jennifer Reside.

PG&amp;E did not fully process the gas stream at their Indian Springs plant on December 12 and 13 and took the reduced shrinkage, 19.000 MMBtu/d, and sold it to HPL at Gas Daily -$0.04.   PG&amp;E did not have the right to do that, so they are going to allocate that volume to Comstock, from whom we will buy the gas at the beginng of the month index.   At the same time PG&amp;E will create an imbalance, for which they will pay HPL the same amount HPL paid them for the gas for those two days.   This should wash the sale at Gas Daily and leave HPL buying the gas at the beginning of the month IFHSC ( the price in the Comstock purchase contract) and selling it at the Gas Daily price for 12/12 and 12/13.

I don't have any contacts at Lone Star related to allocations.   Mark's scheduling contacts may help.   Stacey has a trading contact with the pipeline.   When she returns tomorrow, I will have her give you a call.   The beginning imbalance on Lone Star was around 180,000 owed to Lone Star when we took on the management services in October.

It appears that we have not been actualizing the receipts in Unify just the deliveries -not sure why???.   We have been paying the suppliers based on whatever they invoice us for, which typically has been a smaller number than what we have in Unify.   Also, we have not been able to get a contact for the allocation statement.   In some cases, we get the summary sheet, but no detail and some months we don't get anything at all.   Do you know of a good contact that we can call so that we receive the allocation on a timely and consistent basis?   The contacts on the allocation statements that we do have are not returning phone calls.   I also need to know what was the beginning balance when we took this on for Tenaska?   Anything else that we need from you, I will call you.Thanks,RWDaren J Farmer03/05/20001 10:26 AMTo: Rita Wynne/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: REVISED-Tenaska IV-Cleburne PlantRita, Since I was out of the office most of the week, I missed reading this e-mail.

Also, someone should have identified that the path/nom in MOPS wasn't the same as the nom in POPS.   This discrepancy should have been found before we closed out January.I researched this problem by reviewing both systems (looking at the path id in POPS, finding it in MOPS, and checking the audit on the path in MOPS).   This type of issue should be researched and solved by the logistics group, who has all the necessary tools to find the problem.   The resolution, not the problem, should have been presented to myself or the marketer, with an explanation of what happened.   Some one still needs to find out how the gas was confirmed for the 27th-31st.Since the gas apparently flowed, we will have to apply the overflow to the OBA.

I hope the following will give more clarification.   Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! Thanks,dg   3-9517Sitara / Unify - Process* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had been pathed, scheduled &amp; bridged back from Unify.* Impact - zero impact to Logistics &amp; Volume Management, absolutely harmless.   Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.* Process - Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.   The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.   The field is now highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high level, not on path)The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-pathIf re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new pathUnify pushes back the deal number &amp; meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)Balancing works on deal number &amp; meter only (not ctprty info)The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all information is correct)Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.   (all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match up perfectly)Settlements utilizes information in Unify.   Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which would create two notification entriesIf invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.(note:   there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)Autonoms \"Tom's words of warning\" - Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after deals were pathed and nominated.   Basically it would change a key on an EDI path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already nominated to the pipeline.   If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct the problem.   In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to manually cut the original nominated volume.   This is not an issue with Unify (as explained above).(Dave - feel free to chime in if I left anything out.)

In addition, this release will also capture \"near-time\" the contract changes that are made in global.   This means that need for server bounces will not be necessary.

It gives them the ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.Impact to Logistics - UnifyIf a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production yet...(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where nominations were sent for entire month)can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order to get a clean quick response.What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take place?   (prior periods?   re-pathing?)I have a call into Diane and Dave both.   After speaking w/ them, hopefully I can get a clear understanding of the true impact.   I am sure we'll need to put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when these type of changes are needed.Will keep you posted.Thanks,dg   \tFrom:   Thomas Engel   04/05/2000 09:444 AM To: Kathryn Cordes/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dana Daigle/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth L Hernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, B Scott Palmer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephanie Sever/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne J Swiber/HOU/ECT@ECT, Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECT, Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECTcc: Sylvia A Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Linda S Bryan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Faye Ellis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Consemiu/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Mills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Martha Stevens/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karie Hastings/HOU/ECT@ECT, Regina Perkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Imelda Frayre/HOU/ECT@ECT, William E Kasemervisz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Hunaid Engineer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven Gullion/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larrissa Sharma/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Greif/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to Assignment)Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the ability for you to invalidate the deal - and then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:\"Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure pipeline allows this change.\"   Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is feedback - I assume for the same reasonswe had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems (pre-UNIFY).   Some pipelines will require a new deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just in case it causes problems with theirpipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask the UNIFY team.There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM Market East - but not from ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be the same legal entity. \"Warning - not the same legal entity\"Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals (Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.   Don't forget - the items were locked down for a reason. If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down data that was validated - and someone used thesedeals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created using these deals will get corrupted.   Always check with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in UNIFY.---",

We originally billed TXU on nominated quantities and they have shortpaid us due to meter adjustments.   These are brokered deals where we sold to TXU and purchased from ExxonMobil and Highland.   TXU has provided meter support since the deals were on Lone Star pipeline, however, I am unsure how to have Volume Management reallocate.

Exxon's issue is that the residue volumes that HPL is recording for Exxon's account for transportation do not equal to the wellhead volumes produced and delivered to PGE.   Items that were identified so that Exxon's Issue could be resolved: 1.   HPL is responsible for any UA4 loss/gain and fuel consumed on PGE's line attributable to Exxon's Big Sandy production. 2.   If Exxon's production exceeds 5000 mcf/d, HPL must on a monthly basis elect to process or not process the Exxon Big Sandy Gas.   If HPL elects to   process, then Teco buys the products from HPL. 3.   If Exxon's production flows between 1000 Mcf/d and 4999 Mcf/d, then Teco can process and makeup the shrinkage to HPL with their own gas volumes.   4.   If Exxon's production is less than 1000 Mcf/d, then HPL must terminate the Processing Agreement.   If HPL does not terminate and volume continue to   flow at less that 1000 Mcf/d than HPL loses the shrinkage and must pay to Teco an additional $5000 per month.Solution: 1.   HPL will schedule and record the Gain/Loss Volumes at HPL Meter #9868884 that is attributable to UA4 and Fuel on the PGE line. 2.   HPL will schedule and record the sale volumes of PVR to Teco at HPL Meter #9868884.   3.   The scheduling of the volumes for items   1 and 2 will allow for offset volumes to be record as adjustments to Exxon's transport volumes. 4.   The HPL Logistics dept. (Mary Poorman) will inform Assets Group (Jack Simunek) when and if the volumes nominated for Exxon fall below 1000 Mcf/d.If any of the above does not reflect what was discussed or agreed to, please let me know at X-366650.Thanks, Clem\n"

I appears that nominations were made under ENA's agreement 6520 on Tejas Pipeline Company from Carthage to Indian Hills.   However, both of these points are actually on the Tejas Gas Operating.   ENA doesn't have an agreement to ship on Operating, but HPL does.   I think we need to set up an accounting arrangement to accomodate this deal, it appears as though ENA would be \"piggy-backing\" on HPL's agreement as they actually own the gas.   It appears as though we need to move the volumes from Pipeline to Operating, at the very least.   How have other months been handled with respect to this transport?Please let me know if I may be of any further assistance in resolving this deal.   Mary ext. 35251\n"

It is showing up with a Jan 20003 delivery date.   I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 only.   Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/000 to 12/31/36.   I think this is confusing the system some how.   Also, we still need the purchase deal for Tenaska IV.   It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 booked to the Cleburne desk.   We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.   James is calling me every day asking for an update.   Do you know when we will be able to get this in the system?   I have attached my spreadsheet so you can see the numbers.Megan\n"

      "body": "\nWith PMA's, volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and I can adjust the demand fee on the Sitara ticket.   I am not able to follow your ua4 calculation.   However, there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout September and October.   (This should have been pathed to the Lone Star transport k in Unify).   Is this in that ua4 number?   Williams had been trying to make up volumes from prior periods, so that's probably why their volume came in greater than booked.   (Much of their gas is from El Paso and volumes vary each day from scheduled.)   The volumes that they were trying to make up would go toward the transport imbalance also.   I would think that Cleburne will carry an imbalance on Lone Star from month to month.   After Novemeber, the imbalance should be fairly small.   Our scheduler, Mark McCoy will have that number.   (When we took over this deal, the imbalance on Lone Star was very large.   When the plant went down in Sep, we decided to payback the imbalance then, so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices if the opportunity came up.)The agreement does not specifically state anything about ua4.   But, I will discuss that with Legal.   The intent is for all costs, including ua4 and fuel, to be covered by Tenaska IV.I will be leaving at 1pm today and will return on Tuesday 12/19.   We can get together then if you would like.D   \tFrom:   Jim Pond @ ENRON   12/14/2000 08:56 AM To: Daren J Farmer/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Greg Whiting/Corp/Enron@ENRON@ECT, Troy Klussmann/HOU/ECT@ECT, James Armstrong/HOU/ECT@ECT, Megan Parker/Corp/Enron@ENRON@ECT Subject: Re: Tenaska IV 10/000   Darren, The demand fee is probably the best solution.   We can use it to create a recieivable/payable with Tenaska, depending on which way the calculation goes each month.   How are PMA's to be handled once the fee been calculated and the deal put in the system?Attatched is a schedule detailing what is on the GL for Cleburne as of today.   Some of this info will change by the end of the month.   As you can see, there are some discrepancies between Megan's calculations and what is on the general ledger.   UA4 is also on my schedule.   Unless the buys/sells are volumetrically balanced, we book an entry to balance the desk.   This will change the calculation of what is due from/to Tenaska.   Should we be recording a UA4 entry for Cleburne?   Is it addressed in the agreement with Tenaska?

However, for October 2000, the plant was down the majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing money to Tenaska IV.I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached schedule.)   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.   Do we need to pay this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do this?   This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in the future.Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this.Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here from the Greg, Troy and Jim.

Looking at the October gas supply to the plant, I think Tenaska IV should have been charged at the contract prices with Williams &amp; Apache (i.e.   2.285) and not at what the final price that was actualized per Megan's summary - 230,406 at $710,616.70, price of $3.084.   If this volume was charged   at 2.285 the total would have been $526,4777.71, a difference of $184,138.999.2. Looking at the November gas supply to the plant, Tenaska IV was charged $2.91 per MMbtu, instead of $2.285 for volumes of 267,3000.   At the $2.91   price, the total settlement price was $777,843 instead of $610,780.50 at 2.285, showing a difference of $167,062.50.I reviewed the gas supply agreements and the Williams gas price (pg. 19) for 2000 gas is 2.32, which can be adjusted by the Waha Transportation Adjustment if delivered at Waha.   This adjustment started in 19997 at $.03 per MMbtu and increase by 5% per year.   Thereby currently, the adjustment factor is at .0347, giving us a price of $2.2853 per MMbtu.In reviewing the Apache gas agreement (pg. 222), I noticed that the gas price is 2.285 at Waha &amp; 2.315 at Katy/Carthage for 2000.   Per review of the Apache invoices, it appears that we are not getting our gas at these points but at other places (i.e. Lomak-Sterling &amp; Mendell CDP) at a price of $2.175.   If Enron has a separate agreement at these delivery points and can capture a margin difference then that is upside to Enron.   However, I think the plant should not be charged above the contract price of $2.285.Looking at the daily gas that was scheduled to the plant for November and October, I did not see that their use went over the contracted volumes from Williams and Apache of 45,000 MMbtu per day.   Therefore I don't think spot prices are part of the equation here.   Additionally, I recall from our meeting last month that all Enron makes on this deal is the Agency Fee of $.04 per MMbtu (excluding the margin difference that Enron has on Apache gas delivery points if my scenario above is correct).So based upon items 1 &amp; 2 above, I am suggesting that Tenaska IV adjust their November invoice owed to Enron for gas used by the plant by the gas price differences showed above.   Therefore, I am planning to wire a payment of $484,234.03 (see breakout below) on Friday, 12/222, to Enron on behalf of Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd. for this activity.   Month   Plant Gas Price Amount   November   267,3000   2.91 $777,843   November adjustment   $(167,062.50)   October adjustment   $(184,138.999)   Nov. Agency Fee 1,350,000 .04 $54,000   Sept. Agency Fee 98,813   .04 $3,592.52   Total $484,234.03I discussed these issues with Mike Mazowita, Rick Hill &amp; Jody Pierce before reaching this conclusion.   Should you have any different ideas or thoughts that I am not covering, please call me at 3-7280 and we can discuss.   Thanks.James\n"

I do not see a deal in Path Manager for either month.   I also need some detail on who we are buying and selling this gas from and to.   There are a number of counterparties at Lonestar for ENA and I'm not sure which ones go with this deal.   Is there a schedule you can email to me?

FYIEnron Field Services   -   Has not been nominated since September 999.   Have we stopped doing business on this pipe?   (Just an FYI - ?)   Do we need to get this assigned?   I can find old   notes and try to get this pathed if necessary.   Someone just needs to let me know. Unresolved - appears to be unassigned?   We no longer do business on Enron Field Services.Lavaca Expense Transport -   This is offsystem gas that HPLC Transports for ENA.   ENA has no nom at meter 1000 in Pops for Jan 1. Unresolved   We should have a sale to Entex.   The deal will be enrtered in Sitara.MidCon Texas Pipeline   -   There were deals left unpathed for Jan 1 (and Dec?).   I brokered and nominated the obvious but we seem to have 10,000 with transport contract to move this   gas on and no sale to broker to.   As it stands, it looks like we have a long position.   Who is this assigned to?   I thought Carlos was handling this one, but I could   be wrong.   Unresolved   We have a sale on ECT to Entex in Sitara.Channel Industries Pipeline   -   Several issues here: 1. All Deals with the exception of the long term Transport Expense were left unpathed for Jan 1.   I viewed prior month transactions and pathed appropriately.   Someone   needs to review for accuracy. Also, there were deals that went to zero, that were nominated for January.   Resolved but needs to be verified. 2. We still do not have enough supply to meet our sales requirement.   This issue has been left unsresolved since October 999.   Volume Management cannot allocate was is   not pathed and nominated.   Unresolved or Unpathed?   Carlos is looking into this. 3. There is a transaction for January that is once again not on our point specific transport contracts.   (Rec Mtr 1-63666 10,000 to Del Mtr 2-6203 10,000).   This is a pathed pipeline. We have no rate.   We need to know the rate and whether one of the expense contracts needs to be amended for this transaction, we are not legally covered.   Carlos was handling this pipe in Dec.   Who is this assigned to for Jan? Unresolved   Carlos nom'd this to Channel.   He knows the contract and rate (negotiated by Elsa).HPL Operational -   This Shipper on HPL has been left unpathed for December and January 1.   Who is this assigned to?   This can wait until we get back next week.   If it is left   unresolved, I will get it pathed when I return. I haven't had time to do this yet.   If we haven't figured out the assignement then I will get to it asap.\n"

I   ran into Laurie Allen in the hall and she said we were heavy there and   that she would visit with you abut it.   The second one is Cokinos, they   will not confirm the volume at meter 9656.   We have 9222 and they want that they want 950.   I looked up there nom and that is what they asked for.   Not much of a change.   Last is the one that you faxed down to me this mornings.   Basin Exploration wants to drop there nom due to well problems from 896 to 1.   for the whole month.   Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it.   Tom Cat !!! \n"

In fact, one family found only a couple of boxes of salvagable(?) items from their home (only one family picture) .   I understand that alot of homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.   It was very bad.   What made it worse was the freezing weather coming in.   When we talked to Tonya's parents, they were really in shock of bad it was. Have you been battling those Christmas mobs?   I took friday and Monday off and tried my luck at it.   I didn't last too long.   It doesn't seem right to be cussing everyone out at Christmas...I think I hate people now...I think I'm becoming a scrooge.   Well, I hope ya'll are doing good and staying in the Christmas mood.   Cole is excited about Christmas (wants more Hot Wheels and monster trucks).   Jake doesn't have the foggiest idea what's going on except that he wants to rip every ornament off of the tree and eat it.   We've told him \"no\" so much that he shakes his head back and forth and smiles while he's grabbing for one.   He is a handful.   Jake has also started taking steps.   He just turned 9 months old this month.   That's a little over a month earlier than Cole started taking steps.

Craig Faulbaum has taken personal some time off (I think that this is the 4th week).   So, we have picked up his trades.   Tom restructured the EOL trading.   Carey has gone to Gas Daily and I have taken over the Waha trading for an interim period.   (I'm still responsible for our overall position, but Ami is watching it during trading.)   In other words, everyone on my desk is doing double duty.   And, of course, Tom expects nothing to fall through the gaps (not cracks, anymore).   He has two opening on the trading side that we (Stacey and I) are filling.   I don't know if he has even interviewed anyone yet.   I am getting very frustrated with the whole business.   It doesn't see that he even appreciates the amount of time and stress we are going through to pick up his slack.   Wheww...That feels a little better... getting some of that off my chest. Anyway, Tonya is very uncomfortable.   I think that baby is going to come along any day now (due date is still 3/18).   We are both definitely ready.   The desk is really going to be in a fix when I'm out with that.   That's just too bad.   (I half expect Tom to ask me to come in some.   I've got a real quick answer to that.)How are things at home?   Linda doesn't have you working too much does she?   I just bought the materials to put a sprinkler system in our front yard.   If things get weak on your stock trading, I've got some trenches you can dig for extra cash!   It shouldn't be too bad, I bought a brand new sharp-shooter.   (Of course with a new shovel, I'd have to knock some off of your hourly pay.)The grant price on the employee options is $555.50.I hope everything is going good for you.   I would like to have lunch with you sometime.   I will let you know when things work out here, so that we can do that.

I apparantly forgot to change the deal ticket.For the weekend of 8/5, we need to prorate the gas over the weekend.   Due to operational issues, we agreed to receive gas all weekend and batch the deliveries on Monday.

The first issue is day 1 of the purchase at Fuels Cotton.   We have two deals in Sitara, spot deal 348951 and exchange deal 1572888.   You had said previously that we would know a spot deal had occurred by the new deal ticket and the different pricing.   Since there was a spot deal, we put all of the volume for day 1 on deal 348951.   Duke says that day 1 was not a spot and that it should be on the exchange deal and priced at GD - 0.10.   The exchange deal is currently price at index - 0.05.   Please let me know which deal we are suppose to use and what the price should be.   The second issue is the sale volume on deal 157278 for 8/000.   Duke is telling me that we sold them a batch of gas on the 7th, which we see, but that we are suppose to prorate the gas over the 5th, 6th, and 7th for the exchange.   This is a problem since gas was not confirmed for the 5th and 6th and pipeline shows all of the gas on the 7th.   This is a daily swing meter which electronically feeds into settlements.   We don't normally change these meters.   If you intended for us to prorate this gas, I will need your OK. The emails below are from Marta at Duke notifying us of the change.Megan---"

Right now we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets.   Our group has not taken that step, since we have been most concerned with settling the G/L (after the month is over).   By not having the right rates on the transport usage tickets, the risk is that the P&amp;L will be off during the month.   Would we change process and let Daren set up the transport usage ticket and then have us enter the rate?   If so, we would need to change the process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the correct rate.

They can get their expense numbers either from their estimate (from CPR) or from Unify, where we put the rates in.One potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the transport capacity tickets, we set up the rates for the transport usage tickets.   I am going through the transport usage tickets for February right now (as part of the market meter study) and I see some rates I don't tie back to Lauri's matrix.   For example, Lauri's matrix shows 0.05 from Thompsonville to HSC, but the transport usage ticket (updated by Daren's group) has 0.0555.   This means the economic estimate can be off.

I checked MIPs and there is a measurement statement that supports the flow rate of 7,394 MMBTu.   Daren is there a deal in CPR which may not have fed over to OSS?   I checked OSS for the whole year of 19998 and there are no other deals in OSS.   It does seem strange that this is the only month of flow.Thanks, Stella\n"

The larger of the two volumes is 1,395,000, which is 45,000/day, so the demand rate in deal 514353 is fine.   I am having a problem, though, with the way it is coming to settlements.   It is showing up with a Jan 20003 delivery date.   I think the demand fee needs to be on 10/1 only.   Right now, it is on a line with a date of 10/1/000 to 12/31/36.   I think this is confusing the system some how.   Also, we still need the purchase deal for Tenaska IV.   It should be for a demand fee of $2,571,135.73 booked to the Cleburne desk.   We actually owe $1,798,389.73, but I need to net the Tenaska IV sales with the purchase to clear those receivables.   James is calling me every day asking for an update.

      "body": "\nSteve, I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July 2000.   Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.   But since our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.   ENA then transports the gas to a delivery point.   If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery point.   This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and completing the scheduling in reasonable time.   Plus, it just doesn't make sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as HPLC.   Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.Thanks for your help.Daren---"

Some of your column widths may need to be expanded to view these 2 additional digits.   To do this, go to:Start/Settings/Control Panel/Regional Settings/Date tab, Short date style.
