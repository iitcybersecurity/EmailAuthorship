I have been asked to lead this group.   For those of you who don't know me, I am in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called \"Rates/Regulatory Services.\"   Our working group will have about a dozen or so people from various parts of Public Affairs.   You have been selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.   The Working Group members are:Ray AlvarezSergio AssadRoy BostonMike GrimesKyran HanksRita HartfieldNancy HetrickTom HoatsonPaul KaufmanValeria LimaBob NeustaedterHaving this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed, identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring resources needed by the group. As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, location, phone, e-mail address, and \"area of expertise\".   We will assemble this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an initial meeting.   Please be as flexible as possible.   In some cases, we are many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired time. As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me what you think a group like this should accomplish.   Remember, the roster above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and the proposed goals.   Please have your inputs to me by January 7.   I look forward to working with you.   \n"

Could try ww.rei.com .   You could just get   them hockey goaly helmets for multi-use and just hanging around the house   wailing on each other.   Haven't been to Terry downhill skiing in a while   but went x-country last weekend with the doggies and there's a LOT of   snow.   Brad and Jen are coming this weekend so we plan to check Terry   out.   Should still be decent in a couple weeks.   We'll let you   know.   Made it up to Hanna creek today fly fishing and cought a couple   wopping 4 inchers.   Wound up augered into snow up to my waist.   Bring   your fishing gear in case the skiing sucks.   Definately bring your   x-country gear.   Maybe we could get out for a quick morning at Eagle Cliff   and still make it to Terry to meet up with everyone else by noon.See you later, got to go walk   hounds\n"
