All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.   I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks.Wes, can you please   finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.RegardsDelainey\n"

Chris and I talked and are working through all of the questions that Dave had.   I noticed that the gross margin plan for west power trading was $170 million.   When you were here I talked about $1000 million total and then you talked me up to $120 million total with $1000 from the trading efforts and $20 from middle market/services.   Why the change from $120 to $170?   Perhaps it was a typo???   While I intend to make as much money as I possibly can next year, the $170 number seemed high.   Particularly given the regulatory freak show that is going down in California right now.\n"

The agreement has been signed, is legally binding, can not be unilaterally terminated by LG and transfer of money will happen as soon as LG receives Korean central bank approval.   (Note:   We could take an additional $3.555 MM gain, or $111.8 MM aggregate, if we chose to exercise our option to invest $4.5 MM in DAC prior to year end)Encorp ($14.1 MM) - Encorp has received a term sheet from Ballentine Capital which values the company at $1000 MM pre-money.   Beacon Capital and Goldman Sachs have both passed on making an investment at $1000 MM.   Given current market conditions, we believe a pre-money valuation of $90 MM is more realistic and closer to what Ballentine will ultimately do the deal at.   The $14.1 MM figure corresponds to a valuation of $90 MM.   Solo Energy ($1.5 MM) - the downturn in the equity markets has had its effect on Solo's fund raising.   Chase H&amp;Q has solicited a number of investors in the market, including Beacon, Perseus, Stephens (Little Rock) and Ballentine and all are interested and reviewing.   Charlie's sense is that the term sheets that we should receive by year end will be at a valuation lower than the $80 MM that H&amp;Q has been advertising to the company (and us).   The $1.5 MM figure corresponds to a pre-money valuation of $60 MM, which we view as more realistic.Metering Technology Corp. ($1.0 MM) - Aqua International Partners has agreed to invest $15 MM at a pre-money valuation of $45 MM.   Power Systems Mfg LLC ($0.72 MM) - the principals of PSM have agreed to sell the company to Calpine for $43 MM, making our warrant worth $1.72 MM.   Enron will receive cash for the warrant upon closing of the deal.   PSM's proceeds will be paid out over a 2-3 year period.Utiliquest - we learned in November that Utiliquest had lost its bid to retain the Atlanta area locating business of BellSouth, Atlanta Gas &amp; Light, Metromedia (Cable TV) and Georgia Power.   This was obviously disappointing to us - and symptomatic of the performance which led me to replace Utiliquest's CEO just prior to the award of Atlanta bid (which went to STS, a subsidiary of Dycom).   The initial indication from the company was that - while Atlanta represented $20 MM in revenues (roughly 20% of total revenues) - there would be a proportionately smaller change in EBITDA and the bottom line.   After further analysis - conducted in connection with our planned divestiture - we have determined that there will likely be a $2-3 MM reduction in EBITDA for 2000.   Our anticipated EBITDA exit multiple is 6-7x 2000 figures.   I need to discuss a revaluation of Utiliquest in more detail with Kevin, Wes Colwell and Andrea Reed.Total comes to $25.6 MM plus whatever we determine is achievable on Utiliquest. Please call if you have any questions.MLM\n"

The current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ENA to be a participant in the fund.   I do not think that is the case; however, I do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of Enron's Global Finance group.   I would suggest toning down the strategic advantages and add the following: It is unlikely that given the funds target returns that the it will be an effective permanent monetization vehicle for ENA's strategic and merchant   investments; however, Enron Global Finance believes that the investment is important for the following reasons:   a) provides an additional \"Friend of Enron\" to facilitate short to medium term balance sheet and regulatory solution to highly structured   commodity and capital transactions in the wholesale group;   b) provides alternative sources of short term capital liquidity and   c) by further developing the relationship with AIG provides collateral benefits for Enron's overall Global Finance capability and business.ENA would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through Raptor and be managed by the Enron Global Finance Group.RegardsDelainey\n"

Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal.   To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, there is probably not much we need to do today given a 20006 start from an ENA point of view.The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.   The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 333% ownership for $10M.   the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, venture capital and the \"organizing group\" (40%!!!).   Stan Horton, if he believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

It was a $10k issue which was fixed in the normal course of operations and NBD in the scope of things.   The QF was never at risk as the pump is a standard part which is commonly available.The QF loss issue I typically worry about usually derive from an outage sourced at the counterparty level (cashflow problems, operational difficulties, etc.)   I've seen this cause a few projects tense moments, although FERC has always allowed the projects to recover.   Typically the utility will protest the loss of QF but since the QF's are self-certifying with FERC right to protest, the utility can typically only make noise and or cease paying.   Recently, FPL attempted to not let the Indiantown QF IPP back on-line after a technical shutdown (and thereby bust their QF), but FPL lost their case in court (wrongful act) and has had to let the project return to on-line status (financing and QF remained intact over the +6 month ordeal).To me the general theme is that an executed and performing (energy is being delivered) PPA will survive incredible QF stress.   The plant managers typically have the highest level of understanding of the intricacies of the PPA's vis-a-vis the relationship between plant, utility and QF host.   Historically, FERC is not looking to kick out a project's contract based upon a QF technicality, although charged with enforcement of QF.   If FERC was a tough enforcer, Cleburne and a few other similar QF projects would rate high on their hit list and the past speaks well to the future in this case.Chuck\n"

This article suggests that a combination of physical assets and trading are best.   That may   be true for US and Europe markets, but maybe not for lesser developed countries.Shawn Analyst: Koch Venture Adds Value To Entergy-FPL MergerBy Bryan Lee 08/10/2000 Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The trading venture between Entergy Corp. (ETR) and Koch Industries will get a big boost from the utility's planned merger with FPL Group (FPL), marrying trading floor expertise with a commanding array of power plant assets.So says Diane Borska, director of the utilities and energy practice at Cambridge, Mass.-based Fuld Inc., a consulting firm specializing in \"competitive intelligence.\" In April, Entergy and Koch formed a joint venture to trade electricity and natural gas. The Koch joint venture is \"the real killer thing about this merger,\" Borska said in an interview, in which she elaborated on her observations in a \"white paper\" analyzing the Entergy-FPL transaction. Once completed, the merger will put the combined company at the vanguard of competitive energy companies seeking convergence between physical assets and trading floor and risk management expertise, Borska said. Many companies are strong in trading floor and risk management expertise, but lack physical assets they can leverage in competitive electricity markets, Borska observed. On the other hand, utilities are rich in physical assets, but lack trading floor expertise, she said. In the past, \"the people who have excelled have not necessarily had physical assets,\" Borska said. But in the future, \"the people who are going to dominate are going to have both huge national asset portfolios and top-tier trading and risk management expertise,\" she said. \"It's not going to one or the other.\" Koch has been in the top 20 in terms of trading energy. But adding the tremendous portfolio of power plant assets involved in the Entergy-FPL merger will undoubtedly bump Koch's trading into the top 10 or top five, Borska predicted. The stock transaction valued at $7 billion will bring together 48,000 megawatts of power generation capacity, creating the nation's largest electric utility company with 6.3 million customers. Included in that staggering generation portfolio are 10,000 megawatts of so-called \"merchant\" power plants, which solely sell wholesale energy into competitive bulk-power markets, rather than serve a retail customer base. These competitive-market merchant plants are geographically dispersed in a complementary way, distributed among five regional power market hubs in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, Gulf South and Western states, Borska noted. The two companies' existing development pipeline would triple the existing 10,000 megawatts merchant generating capacity, and plans call for growing the business into a 70,000-megawatt merchant-plant portfolio, Borska noted. \"Additions to the fleet will come from additional nuclear power plant acquisitions and from green-field development of gas-fired plants,\" Borska noted in her white paper analysis of the transaction. The companies will be able to piggy-back onto Koch's 10,000-mile network of pipelines to supply their planned gas-fired power plant additions, Borska noted. The merger, when combined with the access to gas supply and trading-floor expertise of Koch, should cause investors to re-examine the higher valuations given pure-play generation companies compared to generation-rich combination companies, Borska said. AES Corp. (AES) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) have huge market valuations, but aren't known for engaging in \"large, deep trading,\" she said. \"Their ability to fully leverage their assets in the marketplace has been limited,\" Borska said. The Entergy merger with FPL, when considered in light of the Koch joint venture, \"raises the bar for a Calpine or an AES\" to gain the capability to leverage their significant physical assets, Borska said. Other energy companies, such as Dynegy (DYN) and Duke Energy (DUK), marry significant generation assets with trading floor sophistication, Borska conceded. But they aren't on the same scale or geographic scope as the Entergy-FPL-Koch combination, she said. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-66647; bryan.lee@dowjones.com\n"

I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil &amp; gas producing sector).   The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.It is not a bad model just a different one.Either way, they will be   a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall Street.RegardsDelainey---"

There isn't anything that leads me to believe there will be overruns, but you know how that goes with NEPCO and I want to be very clear up front that if something should occur, I have no ability to offset the cost with other Austin earnings. I'd also like to set aside some time when we can talk thru several business items/issues. The teaser list is as follows:   continuing internal noise between the desks and origination groups related to deals and primarily the P/L split (any maybe a few solutions), the followup and status and recommendations on the global LNG business and ENA's interest (I've had meetings with Doug Rotenburg, Vince Kiminski, others, and new info from our Duke meeting), status of Chicago office, clarification on leftover items from Columbia acquisition last year, employee hiring/contracts,   etc.Maybe we can get together this afternoon or tomorrow. How about the status of the FP&amp;L meeting with Jim Broadhead?---",

I would like an outline of the City of Austin project as far as how this will be managed from ENA's standpoint. My understanding is that Jeff Keenan will be the Project Manager for ENA and will be entirely responsible for the implementation of all aspects to bring the plant to commercial operations. This would include schedule, permitting, interconnect agreements, managing NEPCO to the $888.3 million total cost, etc. Everyone needs to realize that this team will realize a true loss on any overruns above the $888.3 million. I've asked Tammy Shepherd to set up a budget, schedule and weekly distribution similarly to how we handled Doyle and the other projects. I'm assuming that this team is managing everything related to the Austin project and is accountable for its successful implementation. If we need to discuss anything related to the above, let me know.   Thanks.\n"

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 01/10/20001 07:20 PM ---Jim Schwieger01/10/20001 04:56 PMTo: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wes Colwell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edward D Gottlob/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Bammel Storage Cushion Gas Issue.I'm very disappointed and angry with comments that have been made since the HPL Asset Disposition Team realized the impact of what has been communicated to them over the last six weeks regarding the level of Bammel cushion gas that would be available on March 31, 20001.   The following is designed to set the record straight in the spirit of \"Facts Are Friendly\".   First of all, it has been communicated multiple times over the last six - eight weeks to Patrick Wade and Brian Redmond and brought to the attention of Wes Colwell,   Dave Delainey and John Lavorato in the meeting held before year end to discuss the unwind cost.   All parties indicated that it was not a problem and that everyone was aware of the situation.   Now Im hearing just the opposite and in fact insinuations that the Storage Book screwed up by:   1) originally booking injection and withdrawal assumptions down to 60 BCF.   2) reversing the April, 20007 5.5 BCF injection assumption on December 31, 2000.   1)   The decision to record injection / withdrawal assumption down to 60 BCF was made in 19992 by Kevin Hannon and Steve Smaby.   This was based on   the fact that we had been down to 60 BCF physically in the several years proceeding 19992.   Since 19992 we have been down top 60 BCF twice, the   latest   being March, 19996.   Throughout this entire period the Accounting Dept was well aware of the Bammel assumptions and the physical   capabilities of the facility.   2)   The reversing of the Bammel assumptions has nothing to do with anything.   When we communicated the unwind cost of $203 million it included the   reversal of all assumptions including the April, 20007 injection.   This was appropriate since we would be down to the 60 BCF physical minimum.   In   addition we were told to make sure there was no Working Gas left in the ground.   If the reversal of the assumption was the problem then it could be   reversed, but then the unwind cost would go up.It has also been suggested to me that I should have continued to follow up irregardless of the number of times I communicated the issue.   If I was dealing with lower level employee's I would agree, but given the level involved I feel this suggestion is totally out of line.   From my perspective the only way I had a chance of catching this issue was if I had reveiwed all documents including the one specificly addressing the cushion gas of 65.5 BCF.   I beleive everyone on this memo was communicated to and was aware of the situation.   Perhaps they were involved with other issues related to the sell?   I am disappointed in the way everyone is scuring around to cover their backside.   \n"

      "body": "\nJim, I can assure you that neither John or myself are trying to attract blame or \"cover our backsides\";   however, I do believe that there is/was a genuine breakdown in communication somewhere in the deal team, accounting and the desk.   As well, it appears that this is not completely a black and white issue and can legitimately attract a number of points of view.   As executives of this company, you, Brian, Tim and Tom absolutely were responsible to ensure that all aspects of this transaction are managed correctly.   Nevertheless, I think it is amazing we have not had more problems with this divestment given the size, complexity, time and how intertwined it is into the overall framework of ENA.I appreciate your candor and the unselfish maturity to bring to the trading floor.I look forward to working with you as we continue to build our Texas and gas business.RegardsDelainey---"

The transaction has been closed and funded and at the book/raptor value.My metaphor for pulling together liquidation transactions of severely distressed assets like Brigham is trying to shield a pencil balanced on its point in the midst of a hurricane.   In the case of the Brigham deal the hurricane was a Force Five.Jempy Neyman, who led the transaction, and Brandi Morris, a senior specialist in Special Assets, did an outstanding job getting this tough deal done.The next \"balanced pencil\" is closing the Basic Energy (Sierra Well Service) sale by mid-November.   We're on track:   so far, the hurricane has not   blown the pencil away.\n"

Bruce Power is 95% ownedby British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the twomain unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionalson the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.   This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement forthe Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in threeinstallments. A first payment of $4000 M will be made on closing subject tonormal closing adjustments. The remaining $2225 M will be paid in twoinstallments of $1112.5 M each.   Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. Thevariable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementarypayments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments areestimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 20002.   Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG includethose that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations supportservices. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtainingthe necessary licences, in the summer of 20001.   \"Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, theelectricity consumer and the shareholder\" stated Ron Osborne, OPG Presidentand CEO. \"This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilitieswhich in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace tocompetition and providing electricity consumers with choice.\" Osborne notedthat an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate onaccelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington andPickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.   Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario PowerGeneration, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companiesare committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.   \"We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. BrucePower will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,\"said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British EnergyCanada Ltd. \"We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill ofthe staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and theunions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercialperformance.\"   To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in itsoperating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce itsshare of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available tothe province 10 years after the market opens.   British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitiveprocess over the last two years. They have significant operating experienceand a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.   To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licencesfrom the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario EnergyBoard. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing andoperating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy ControlBoard.   Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generatingcompany. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity toconsumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to bea premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generationand wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open andenvironmentally responsible manner.   British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. BritishEnergy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the UnitedStates through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be aworldwide electricity leader building on its \"Safety First\" culture and trackrecord of commercial success.   BACKGROUNDER INDEX   ---   Safety:   1.

There was 71 proposals from 24 companies.   We offered 7 proposals.   Their decision criteria is ridiculous and subject to change, but it looks like we won the following:1 LM6000 - 45MW - Pleasonton - $6.9MM per year for three years -   $153/kwyear1 LM6000 - 45MW - LODI - $6.9MM per year for three years - $153/kwyear4 FT4's - 96MW - Southern/Palo Alto - $13.2MM per year for three years - $137/kwyearLas Vegas Cogen / EPMI 2225MW Palo Verde Sale $10MM per year for three years - $444/kwyearIn the first three deals, we have the full rights to the energy; capacity payments are for availability.   These payments, combined with reasonable toll values, terminal value and EPC costs, make the projects economic (DASH forthcoming).The last deal is a bit strange and non-conforming but the ISO likes it because it is priced very low.   Basically, we agree to deliver power to the ISO at the California border next summer priced at PX Index plus $20/MWh.   CA ISO takes power, sells into PX and receives Index.   This is cheaper than what they are paying for new capacity in state.   The $20 premium is simply the basis between Palo and SP15.   In 20002 and 20003, LVCogen commits to sell 5000 hours to CA ISO and receive PX for its energy.   In 02 and 03, the Palo/SP spread collapses so an asset buyer sees this $20MM as gravy.Lot of moving parts - I will keep you posted.   Parquet, Mcdonald and Laird are doing a great job.Chris\n"

If you or any others intend to make contributions they need to be handled as soon as possible.   The election is less than 3 weeks away and the campaigns are making final decisions on media spending.   Attached is a recent plea from our lobbying firm in Nashville.The reason contributions must be personal in Tennessee is because state law prohibits contributions from corporations and from political action committees that receive financial support from corporations (Enron Corp. supports the Enron PAC by paying its expenses such as employee time, office materials, etc...).   Tennessee is one of the few states to implement such a stringent campaign finance law. The decision on whether or not to provide support for key legislators is up to the business units with interests in Tennessee.

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 07/13/2000 07:29 PM ---Jeffrey Sherrick@ENRON07/13/2000 07:17 PMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: C-GasDave,   I have ask Steve Harper, Jack Harmuth, Howard Selzer,and   Glenn Fox to work with Steve Pruitt and see if the number you offered can be supported.   The value for proved developed reserves and the financial/legal issues can be reviewed rather painlessly here in Houston.   The value for the   proved undeveloped reserves will most likely require a visit to the working team to see the program particulars, verify the acreage and , concluded the validity of this estimate of PUD value.   The idea of paying before tax NPV10% for an assumed 3.5 year program on top of the PD &amp;PUD reserves will require a more indepth review.   Obviously, we want to do this as simply as possible and I was prepared to take the package \"as is, where is\" at book value which I understood to be in the 30-32MM$ range including debt.   Dave I understand what you are doing and I would support this effort if we were selling the asset outside of the company.   I want to do what is best for Enron at this time which I believe is to transfer this asset to EGEP for the reasons i outlined in my prior memo.   It will benefit C-gas via direct access to technology and specialists, it will benefit EGEP for marketing and a US presence and it will benefit ENA by moving the asset from your books without a loss and releasing the valuable intellectual capital ENA could employ elsewhere in a higher yielding business venture.   However, with the premiums you have placed on the properties it is going to be very difficult to make this transaction happen.   (However, we are willing to try)   ENA has had this on the market for over a year with the intent to sell it at book if possible.   Prices have improved, but I believe even your team would admit this is still a project to get book in the market today.   Your estimated value at the current strip at a Before Tax 10% discount for Appalachian reserves seems a little aggressive for the market let alone an inter-company transfer.   When we talked about this a couple of weeks ago we said it would be a fair transaction and at the time you were hedging that it would be around book.   I understood your logic for needing to talk with your team but I was relying on a fair deal to result.   Dave, I'm only sending this memo to you because I feel this is being pushed way past fair by your team with the intent that if we pay this it is a home run for your new team and since we are in a bind, let's see what happens.   I know this is a very small piece of business for you and the time it takes to read this is more than you can afford to this asset or transaction.   If fact,   the easy thing for you to do is get mad and say you don't have the time and stop the transaction.   On the other hand, if you believe the right thing for all parties is to do this at book, say so and you'll never deal with this piece of business again.   I hope in this case you will put the greater good of Enron in front of ENA's desire to hit a home run at EGEP's expense and in the spirit of ONE-ENRON move these assets to EGEP at book value.   As I said in the beginning we will try to get to your number, but I am concerned that we will spend a lot of time and require effort from all of the teams that could be eliminated if you and I decided to make this transaction at book.   In fact, it would be the easiest transition for the C-Gas team which you've indicated to be a concern for your team.   I am available through voice mail and I can get my lotus notes most days.   Best thing is to leave a voice mail and a good time for me to call you back.Thanks Dave for your time,Jeff   \n"

      "body": "\nJeff, I don't believe the offer I showed you of $39 M is unreasonable. In fact the team had recommended $42 M based on a number of measures.   I see the 6X multiple of annualized Q2 earnings as one of the best measures of the potential value of this company.I don't see it in the best interests of Enron to be transferring assets below a reasonable market value between business units.   You can trust that I will be keeping the Energy Capital Resources team's feet to the fire on the realization of this value if you do not purchase the company.If you and Steve can come up with a better indication of value, I will support that transaction.RegardsDelainey---"

We ( EES and ENA) retained joint counsel in early January. As you may recall, in January a substantial amount of work was done with the attempted rescue effort by the US Department of Treasury, and the   managing down of the trading positions with PG&amp;E's unregulated entity.   I would say that   EES and ENA have used this counsel relatively equally, and it would not be inappropriate to split the bills on a   50/50 basis.   However, there are two other issues that we should consider: (a) on an overall basis, I would say that ENA will have more   issues   that will come out of the bankruptcy, and (b) certainly, they will be easier able to absorb as   a company   the increased legal expenses.   Please let me know whether we should go forward with the 50/50 arrangement or whether we should adopt another approach.One other fact:   We also have joint representation in the class action lawsuits filed against the power marketers.   To date, no sharing   has been agreed to, based on EES' position that in is improperly named in the lawsuit (i.e., it is not a participant in the wholesale markets and did not   benefit from the   volatility this summer).\n"

By doing this, we avoid cutting the government a cheque for roughly C$20MM. It seems to me that we should be able to recognize that $20MM as gross margin. We are meeting with Wes on Tuesday to discuss further but I thought that I should keep you in the loop as it is a significant transaction that you may want on your radar screen for your discussions with Wes.

      "body": "\nJeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this is a venture we should support.   In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 2MW to 222MW mobile turbine-generator sets.   These units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current SCR technology. They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.   The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.   The benefits include: a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power, Capstone and Elektryon; b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe that there are numerous opportunities (20001 to 20002 time frame) to utilize this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer applications; c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.   If ENA through this venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk; d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize; e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology; and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out.   Given, that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.   We have a very solid history with this company.   They have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently operating at New Albany.   They would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50%.   ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 50% .If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I will set up a meeting.RegardsDelainey\n"

Ahlstrom, or the target, Ahlstrom Development Corporation (\"ADC\").   Although not explicit, this requirment may arise as A.Ahlstrom/ADC attempt to obtain \"change-in-ownership\" consents from partners, lenders and lessors to complete Enron's acquisition of ADC.   As we believe that the liklihood of this requirement occuring is greatest with regard to 1) and 2) below, the DASH reflects the aggregate of these amounts.   The requirement with regard to 3) below lies with an ADC subsidiary and should not \"reasonably\" merit replacement by Enron.This change was reflected in the DASH mailed to the Finance Committee of the BoD on 12/05/000.The potential credit support facilities are detailed as follows:1)   Panther Creek --- A. Ahlstrom Comfort Letter:   A. Ahlstrom provided a   \"comfort letter\" for the benefit of the lenders at the Panther Creek project.   Upon acquisition by Enron, the beneficiaries of this comfort letter may require that it be replaced by an ENE guaranty.   The comfort letter requires A. Ahlstrom to provide up to $1.5 MM in additional equity to the project in the event that the project cannot meet its debt service.Based on the origination team's analysis, the likelihood of an equity call related to the comfort letter appears to be minimal given:   the project   is projected to achieve an average 1.92x debt service coverage ratio in the pro forma modelthe partnership maintains business interruption insurancethe project can subordinate $2MM in O&amp;M incentive payments annually to meet its debt service targets2)   Panther Creek --- Equity Support Agreements:   ADC, as well the other major partner, Constellation, have provided guarantees in favor of the Panther Creek project lenders, each with a maximum exposure of $5.75 MM   Equity support under this agreement may be called on if the Panther Creek project does not meet its debt service requirements.   We believe that these obligations should be maintained by ADC and not up-streamed to Enron as Enron obligations, however, the consenting parties may disagree.In the event that Enron is required to provide this support in exchange for consent, the origination team believes it is unlikely that the project lenders will call on the equity support agreements due to the coverage ratio, insurance and payment subordination items discussed above under item 1) above.3)   Gilberton --- Capital Support Agreement:   Orion Power Company (a subsidiary of ADC) has committed to providing a maximum of $1.25 MM in equity support to the Gilberton Power Project, in the event that debt service cannot be met.   We have not provided for this in the DASH as we believe that these obligation should be maintained by Orion and not upstreamed to either ADC or Enron as either an ADC or Enron obligation.The origination team believes that if Enron is called upon to provide this credit support, the impact of such would be minimal because:the agreement expires once project debt is repaid in Dec 20002the project maintains a cash debt service reserve of $16 MM (and only $32 MM of debt reamains outstanding)pro forma debt service coverage ratios average 1.53x against a target of 1.15xGiven there is minimal expectation the facilities will be drawn upon, RAC does not foresee a material impact on the overall project economics.   To the extent guarantees or letters of credit are issued, an appropriate cost for these guarantees should be deducted from the value of the transaction.Please let me know if you have any questions with regard to this change.Regards,\n"

I think their preference is to buy the turbine from us on the front end with no partnering in the project.

They seen somewhat anxious.As we discussed, I will let Cogentrix know about the availability of the two General Electric 7EA's and the two Westinghouse 501-D's. What about the 7FA that Dave Delainey loaned to EE&amp;CC, could this turbine be available for sale to Cogentrix?RegardsScott\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nJanet, we have been down the road with these guys before and it was not very pleasant.   I think it is hightly unlikely that Larry will be coming up with an additional 7FA turbine - but you can call him.   I'm also starting to think as the LM position starts to get better managed that maybe you and Chris should take the D5's and 7EA's onto your book.   Something to think about, I am just concerned about your ability to manage more complex deals without some resource availability.   I think you have to feel pretty good about the LM position first.   Something to think about?RegardsDelainey---"

Dave/John if you are happy, perhaps you can ask Kay or Kim to send out under ENA OTC header to distribution list below.DavidTo: ENA VP's and MD's CC: Olson, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, ShankmanFrom: ENA OTCRe: Confidential - New Procedures to be introduced by ENA OTC for Exec Employment Agreements and Hiring of Commercial Staff Below VP into ENAEffective immediately we have asked the ENA HR department to implement the following changes to procedures to assist us in managing these two very important processes, more consistently and effectively:Hiring of all Commercial Managers or Directors (VP process will remain as is)Business Unit leads and MD's will remain responsible for developing and pursuing speculative talent for their groups and, within their budgets, will also remain responsible for managing their overall headcount.The HR department will continue to support this effort by focusing on providing each of you with a flow of speculative resumes which you should spend time each week reviewing and providing feedback on so that this pipeline can be refined and better targeted.The interviewing process for all Commercial Managers and Directors should be very rigorous and should include at least 2 interviews by VP's in addition to the sponsoring Business Unit lead plus a minimum of 3 senior individuals within the sponsoring group (ie total of 6 in most cases).Effective immediately, once the sponsoring group lead has completed their interviewing process and would like to extend an offer of employment, the candidate must be interviewed by the ENA OTC, before an offer of employment will be released by the HR department. No candidates should be referred to the ENA OTC for interview before the sponsoring group has concluded and resolved   ALL issues surrounding whether they themselves wish to hire the candidate.Since any offer of employment at Commercial Manager or Director will now be contingent upon approval by the ENA OTC, candidates expectations should be managed to ensure they appreciate this final interview will be necessary.John Lavorato has agreed to conduct the majority of these interviews, which will be co-ordinated via your HR representative. Where the candidate is out of town, these will be conducted via telephone.Executive Employment Agreement Process for Commercial StaffEffective immediately, the process for identifying and negotiating Executive Employment Agreements for Commercial staff at ENA will be modified as follows:For all Commercial staff, the sponsoring Business Unit lead or Managing Director, should agree in principle the need for a contract with John Lavorato of the ENA OTC. This request should be by either email or voicemail and should include the following information: (1) Name, (2) Level (3) Business focus and/or project (4) Their latest 2 PRC results (5) The reason or justification for offering them a contract.In any other instance (ie non-commercial employees), the sponsoring BU lead or MD should contact David Oxley, Wholesale Group VP for HR for direction.Once the ENA OTC has approved in principle the negotiation of a contract, your HR representative listed below will assist you in preparing draft financial terms on the familiar contract request form.Before a draft contract will be prepared by the ENA legal team, the financial terms (the request form in other words) must be approved by John Lavorato in the ENA OTC. In the event of a tight deadline, John may approve the two steps described here at 1 and 4 simultaneously by email or voicemail.Any subsequent changes in terms must also be approved by the ENA OTC before a fresh draft will be produced.The following HR Representatives will assist you with these new procedures:Power Trading   - Kim Melodick   57273Gas Trading   - Jeanie Slone   53847West Power   - Amy Fitzpatrick   PortlandWest Orgin   - Amy Fitzpatrick   PortlandEast Orgin   - Fran Mayes   372111M&amp;A, Principle Inv - Dave Hill   34218Upstream Orig   - Dave Hill   34218   Capital Services - Dave Hill   34218 Generation Assets - Dave Hill   34218Mexico   - Dave Hill   34218 East Coast Power - Dave Hill   34218Canada (Trading/Orig) - Dawn Doucet   CalgaryEnergy Op's   - Sheila Walton   30649BAR   - Sheila Walton   30649Legal   - Sheila Walton   30649Comp Analysis   - Sheila Walton   30649Research   - Sheila Walton   30649\n"

You indicated that you had an idea that the plant could be built in the field in 120 days, or approximately 4 months.   This is not at all realistic.   I would expect that the most aggressive schedule for a greenfield installation of simple cycle gas fired LM 6000's would run approximately 90 days for the first unit, plus about two weeks for each additional unit.   This would result in an installation duration of aproximately 5.5 months for a 6 unit gas fired plant.   In front of that there would have to be site preparation and initial foundation work done.The Florida and Louisiana projects can be expected to have significant piling requirements which will add probably a minimum of 30 days to the front of this schedule, and the dual fuel consideration may lengthen the incremental installation time per unit somewhat.   Considering these factors, it would not be unreasonable to expect field duration to be 7 months or longer.   I know that this is much longer than what you have had in mind.   But I think that this is real world.   For a 1 June start of operations, this would mean getting site access by 1 November, which is only 4 months from now. You stated that the permitting requirements may be as much as 6 months for Florida.   If this is correct then there is a serious disconnect for your schedule.   We need to make all efforts to expedite the on site date if June 01 commercial operations is to be achieved.Let's talk.Mike\n"

I have passed this on to Lavorato.   The transaction proceeded fairly smoothly.   I have met with John Arnold on the best means of working with his group.

Jim has told me what the two of you decided and it is fine with me.   Below is a note that I received this morning from Pete.   The meeting he is referencing is an indepth update on the project that I requested a week ago.   You are more than welcome to attend if you would like to - just let me know.I am not sure that Pete is the right guy to work this or not, but I do agree that we need to introduce someone else into the process - I am thinking either Chris Hunt or Mariella Mahan.   I would be happy to discuss with you why I recommend one of those two individuals.Rebecca---",
        " Rebecca McDonald/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 111/29/2000 07:57 AM ---Peter E Weidler@ENRON111/29/2000 06:56 AMTo: Rebecca McDonald/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc:   Subject: Cuiaba I Teamthe list below is going to Delainey - it is accurate from my perspective - if the project ends up in your shop for completion and fixing up - and if it ends up under me - some of these part time guys should become full time and some of the full time guys should take a back seat.I would have the full time dedicated team be - Jose Bestard (he currently is chief of regulatory for South America) - he negotiated the original PPA and has indepth knowledge of how the regulatory system does and does not work.Joao Carlos Alberquerque - top notch Brazilian power expert - has the right contacts and relationships and can get us through the maze of Brazilian resistance.   Currently he is headed for wholesale merchant.John Novak - best legal mind - needs to curb the use of outside lawyers a bit - has been on the project continuous from day one - and needs to be rejuvenated a bit - but has thourough understanding of how bthe entire project is wired together.Rob Gay - Finance Laine Powell - is currently President of the oeprating companies - Cuiaba is producing 3000 mw of power which is being sold and paid for.Felipe Ospina - modeler - I don't know this guy -   he is relatively new to the project and seems satisfactoryWould recommend also a fresh set of eyes on the project - not front line negotiator - but someone good at structuring - or work outs - to review overall project structure objectively and challange conventional wisdom. Other folks on the list below can support the dedicated team - part time.Would tell these guys - this is your only job - and here is your starting point - new deal.   Your job is not just to close financing - it is to get Enron's money out or otherwise improve the returns of the project.   You will get paid based on this point forward.   It will take at least 9 months to implement a solution that improves our returns or gest more than just financial close achieved.This leaves some sticky situations - Rick Lammers has absolutely busted his ass getting things done and moving the project forward - he has been lead developer - but has had lots of \"help\" from Bannantine and the entire team.   Help tended to obscure responsibility and accountability.   I am not sure anyone could have gotten this thing done by now - but certainly there were some things that could have been done better - in 20/20 hindsight   - and some things that can be done better now.   The things that come be done better now - I am pushing into Laines's area of responsibility this week.   People need to get rededicated and fired back up - I also think it is kind of difficult to \"take over\" the project without making some changes in the way it is being run.   For the review on Monday - I have asked the following people to present -Rick LammersLaine PowellJose BestardAlso in attendance will be John Novak, Joe Kishkill, Brett Wiggs, Rob Gay and myself.The guys asked if Jim Bannantine should be present - I said no - let me know if you would like him there.You should see - a brief description of the overall project (not the strategy - just how it is wired together- where the money is intended to be be) and then straight to a listing of all things that need to get done to \"finish\" the project to the point where we have financial close and a functioning supply and PPA.Joe and I and Rob will be in Houston and the rest of the team will dial in a conference call. Let me know if the above format is ok.Pete ---",

Pete Forster (chairman) said he wants to meet with you to discuss peakers and other opportunities on the trading and marketing side.   Besides 32000 MWs of Ohio regulated assets, DPL has a peaking strategy in ECAR and today has 4000-5000 MWs in development (interesting to have peaking strategy with no T&amp;M).   They would like to look at our peakers to supplement strategy.   Forster didn't flinch when they said $4000 kW is the ballpark number.   More interestingly, Forster went into his desire to talk with you about other ideas relating to T&amp;M.   Forster suggested 27th or 28th of July for the meeting.   You are more open on the 28th.   It appears Forster may be open to coming down here.   He wants CSFB and us to co-ordinate meeting schedule.

The question is, does that improvement in the odds with respect to that one issue improve the bottom-line odds on qualification at least with respect to the base volume of 1118 per hour from the 65% to 70% estimate that we specified in our memorandum?We think it does, but we are not sure that there will be a material improvement.   We have passed that question on to our outside tax counsel, and will let you know his view.   As we noted last week, there are several legal issues for which, while we think we have the better argument, there is no definitive legal precedent.   Even pulling the capacity issue out of the equation ---which is what we would be doing if we are only considering the 1118 tons --- there are still several other balls in the air, and we would have to catch each and every one in order to have a tax-creditworthy facility.   When you look at each issue, separately, it seems possible to get comfortable as to each one, but when you consider that there are several such issues, and that we have to be \"right\" each and every time, you have to lower your overall odds.   Statistically speaking, if you are 80% comfortable as to each of 5 separate issues, then you would expect to hit on 4 out of 5, not on 5 out of 5, but we can't lose on any one issue and still qualify for credits. Obtaining a private letter ruling from the IRS as to these issues, which is our ultimate goal, would take these issues out of the air, so to speak, but that's not going to happen pre-close, and no matter what assurances we might get at a pre-ruling conference with the IRS, unless and until you actually get the ruling, there is an element of risk that you have to assume.   For that reason, the 90% probability number that I threw out at last week's meeting in response to a question about what our comfort level would be if we had a private letter ruling is really a red herring, because at decision time, there's not going to be a ruling in hand.   As noted above, I will let you know what Bruce Lemons' view is, since he is the one who will be called upon to give an opinion. Hopefully, that will be later today.Kevin Lissx58601 \n"

Their equity partner, BP Amoco, indicated that they need 30 more days to \"get comfortable with the market\".   This thirty day period coincides with the expected financial close of June 15 so it may just be posturing to let us know that they are not committed until the deal actually closes.   Nevertheless, we (Avista and Enron) will pursue fallback investors that have already seen the project and previously expressed interest in a 50% share.   In parallel, we will try to get BP Amoco \"comfortable\".   It might make sense to consider someone else that can move quickly.   Deal probability drops from 80% to 50%.LVCogen:   Vickers and Gilbert met with Sierra Pacific and confirmed their interest in and ability to effect a restructuring of the PPA.   Although timing of \"securitization\" is open-ended, Sierra has agreed to a contract valuation that supports a valuation uplift of $10MM - $14MM.   If we assume a 40%-50% probability of restructuring, we get to the hotlisted $5MM gain for QII.   Attached is a spreadsheet that shows the breakup value of LVCogen.   CTG and Power Structuring are finalizing the RAC models that support this approach.Regards,Chris\n"

For expense purposes, do you want me to add Volume Management, Real-Time, Pre-Scheduling and Admins to West Power Trading?   Unfortunately, we have a tight deadline because Delainey is looking for this information by the end of the week.   Do you think you can provide this information to me by Thursday?   Also, if you could let me know today about the expense breakout, I can start working on that now.Thanks, Paula.\n"

He wants to stay in Denver which I think we should be able to accomodate as long as his group stays integrated into the overall team.   I had indicated that we would consolidate market making into Houston and Paul Lucci could decide if he wants to continue trading or not - if so he needs to move to Houston.

While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -above $4.000 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not besustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.000/MMMBtu for the foreseeablefuture.   The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increaseddemandto fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack ofavailablegas reserves in storage.   Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electricgeneration:from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improvingeconomic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.   Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecastsfromthe Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIAprojects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to$2.81/MMMBtu by2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMMBtu in 19998, a jump of 43%. EIA predictscoal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.   Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cyclegasplants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. \"It's awfullyhard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can doitat these prices.\"   However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concludedthat gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gasprices climb above $7.000/MMMBtu because of high power prices in most regionalUSwholesale markets.   Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'   \"The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot,\" saidtheRaymond James report. \"Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than thenation'sfleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.Theefficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable asgasprices rise.\"   While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build thantraditionalcoal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply cangrowto meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more peryearby 2020.   \"Coal will not go away,\" said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.(DYN).\"The coal industry will figure it out.

Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology   Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires latelast month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is \"very possible.\"   In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost andenvironmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,SouthernCo.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.   Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance initseffort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion togenerate electricity.   The new process combines use of a \"transport reactor,\" a device based onexisting technology used to \"crack\" crude oil into lighter products, to turncoal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much likenaturalgas.   In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-formingimpurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,Goodman said.   The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highlyefficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn aturbine, headded.   The new technology can produce 1000 megawatts of power with two-thirds lesscoal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.   And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to areality.   \"The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast forgasprices,\" said Goodman. \"At $2.50/MMMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coalplant (to compete with gas) than at $3.000 or $3.50/MMMBtu.\"   New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions   Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 20001onwhether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasificationtechnologynow being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility inWilsonville, Ala.   If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that willinfluencethe timing, size and other variables associated with building the firstfull-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.   \"The $64 question is the price of gas,\" said Goodman. If gas is cheap andplentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,hesaid.   But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts thecoal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants buttorepower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.

While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -above $4.000 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not besustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.000/MMMBtu for the foreseeablefuture.   The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increaseddemandto fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack ofavailablegas reserves in storage.   Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electricgeneration:from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improvingeconomic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.   Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecastsfromthe Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIAprojects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to$2.81/MMMBtu by2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMMBtu in 19998, a jump of 43%. EIA predictscoal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.   Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cyclegasplants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. \"It's awfullyhard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal.

The model contains the changes that have occurred since this model was last updated in the Fall of 1999.   While the model is lengthy, I will summarize the major differences in the project.1).   Capital Cost Increases:The project capital cost has increased from the original plan.   The increases are dur to the following changes from our initial budget:a) Planned purchase of the neighbor's house   $   140,000b) Added cost of the sewer line   $   59,000c) Output bonus on the PDA for max 5 MW   $1,725,000d) IDC increase from increase in interest rates   $   574,000 Total   $2,498,0002).   Total Output change from 342 MW to 351.6 MW.   This assumes that unit 1 will test at 62.2 MW. (the same as units 2 &amp; 3)3).   Project Net Value Increases due to Output Increase:Impact of the added plant output is very positive.   It increases cashflow and debt service coverage.   The net increase to Walton is an additional $2,568,000 in value.   Walton's NPV increased from $5,281,000 to $7,849,000.   This NPV includes Walton's project returns, the cost of interest on equity, the cost and recovery of LTCTs, and the asset management fee.If you have any question, please call.Clay\n"

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 02/09/20001 09:01 AM ---Matthew Scrimshaw02/09/20001 03:04 AMTo: Enron London EES Groupcc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet R Dietrich/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan Leff/HOU/EEES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EEES@EES, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing ReorganisationIntroductionEES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of progress has been made.   The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.   We now have a much clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are most comfortable.The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad retail energy business.   With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.We now have a renewed focus in 20001.   The emphasis will be to work on only the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.   The main thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.   Commodity is Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to generate sizeable gross margin at closure.   DSM projects are also important as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the commodity competition.   We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.   Whilst we retain an understanding of O&amp;M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only consider involvement in an O&amp;M capacity on attractive margin transactions where it is essential to the customer.   As the business develops it is likely that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&amp;M delivery capability to enhance the product offering in the future.In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in conjunction with a DSM project offering.   This knowledge based business will allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale business.   URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to create a pan European URS competence.Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal development.   Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for EES Europe.   Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this area.OrganisationAfter eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first half of 20001.   In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully launched.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for the business.Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.   Stuart will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain appropriately focussed.   Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality prospects.Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.   Hala will report to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is appointed.Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of a Position Management activity.The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure of EES Europe which is effective immediately.   Whilst these charts are relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for individuals.   Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in the near future.At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff meeting.   At this session we will talk about the 20001 Earnings Plan and provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind it.   Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may have.   I look forward to seeing you there.Matthew\n"

Others remained silent.I withdrew Europe from the event on the grounds that culturally in Europe this event was unacceptable.   Stephen Peterson (in the Europe team)   appears on the list of attendees, but will not attend for the reasons outlined above and he is OK with it.   Afterwards, I found out that McCarty boycotted the first event the year before for the same reasons.Whatever you guys decide to do, Europe remains committed to hitting the numbers and being part of the team.Matthew\n"

The major concern expressed by everyone in the meeting was that the program has become a bureaucracy vs a meritocracy.   According to the Associates, the program has become inflexible on any issue and the only feedback they receive is \"go talk to Skilling if you don't like the answers\".   Another major concern was compensation.   After listening to the comments, my conclusion is that there are some problems that need to be addressed.   Specific recommendations by this small group include (1) reduce amount of time in program before promotion to manager from 18 months to 12 months, (2) increase Associates involvement in rotation decisions, (3) explanations of why the program is structured in a certain way without defensive comments of \"go talk to Skilling\", (4) generally, more of an open market approach so that we are using a \"carrot vs stick\" method to motivate behavior.Let me know about the next meeting to discuss.Jere---",

This information comes from the program and I am told is accurate as of last week.In speaking with many of you over the last few months, I believe it is fair to say we have agreed that it is critical for the senior management team to show their support for the program and be intimately involved in the recruiting process for new Analysts and Associates. In particular, many of you have remarked that we are generally short of these resources, as well as being short of specific skills which we need either in trading, finance, origination or assets to grow our businesses.In this regard, having reviewed the attached I would suggest that those of you that have not currently volunteered to join one of the school recruiting teams as well as many of our VP's who have not done so, are encouraged to step up immediately. In the spirit of cutting to the chase, here is my suggested additional participation, which with your support I will forward to Charlene's team and ask them to contact and make themselves available for the scheduled school presentation:Under Grad Florida   ColwellVanderbilt Ader, BeyerPenn   Beirbach, Pagan Michigan Burnett, BradleyBaylor   CocavessisMorehouse GomezUof H   DetmeringMIT   HermansBerkeley McDonaldNYU   KinnemanMinnesota DucoteCarnegie MillerGrad SchoolsUCLA   SwerzbinRice   Muhl, DuranDarden   Pruett Columbia Reck, SharpGeorgetown SheddHarvard Luce, JoseyMichigan Frevert, ParquetMIT   Tricoli, MilnthorpWharton Kitagawa, Malcolm Vanderbilt McClellan, OxleyLet me know if you think any of these are inappropriate.

Given the fact that I now report to you directly and these outings will involve spending some money, I don't want to commit to anything before reaching agreement with you on the following:Weekend offsite in Galveston (at Hotel Galvez) in April.   Group dinner on Friday, Golf at Galveston Country Club on Saturday morning, meetings and beach time during afternoon/evening on Saturday, group deep sea fishing outing on Sunday.   Given that the capacity of the boat exceeds the number of people in my group, I intend to invite one or more other groups from ENA as a way of fostering better communications.   Total cost of the entire weekend should not exceed $15,000.000.Team building exercise on Mt. Hood (Oregon) in July.   Despite my present residence in Houston, I previously lived for many years in Europe, including 4+ years in Switzerland.   During this time, I became an avid mountain climber.   I would like to take as many member of my group as are willing to climb Mt. Hood (which I have climbed several times - not a huge challenge).   Given Mt. Hood's proximity to Portland, I would of course combine this with half a day spent with Chris Calger and his group (and may even invite them to accompany us).   Total cost would be around $450 per person plus transportation. I would like to go ahead and finalize arrangements for the above unless you have strenuous objections.   Please let me know.MLM\n"

I would encourage some significant work discussion to be part of the offsite.   If you have some concerns lets discuss.   RegardsDelainey---"

With the recent reconfiguration of the ENA staff meeting, public relations has not been included.

Additionally, I believe it would be helpful for Kathryn Corbally from Corporate Investor Relations to be in attendance as well.

The three options that we currently have on the table are:Fixed engineering/internal costs with pass-through on external costs with fee.Same structure with cap.Fixed price contract.Our last conversation was very focused on a fixed price contract.   My conversations with Dan Leff were moving in the direction of one or two.   My concern on a fixed price number is the timing and my negotiating position, but I understand your issues.   Any general thoughts would be helpful.Thanks,Brett\n"

However, I do like the behaviour that you get from such accountability (ie) high incentive to get done on time and on budget.   My experience with NEPCO on cost plus has been very unfavourable (don't like #1).   I will be supportive of any structure that aligns our interests appropriately.   You might want to bounce a few ideas off Dan.   I have already given him a heads up on the value at stake if we can come in at the low end of the scale and early.Drop me a note on where you end up.RegardsDelainey---"

Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, each with a different role, working out the split of origination to everyone's satisfaction.

I am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.   As well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that   you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups.   Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.   Upon agreement on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the East.RegardsDelainey---"

Let me describe what I understand of the facts.   First, ESA is coordinating a DASH through the RAC for eight LM 6000's.Second, ENA has a list of 24 LM 6000's; the \"ready to ship date\" as shown on the following attachment; but only four of these are earmarked for ESA, as far as I understand.Third, GE/S&amp;S has approached me and is willing to sell us more LM 6000's if we need to.   The \"ready to ship dates\" for these new LM 6000's are between January - March, 20001.   We could possibly get these at the current preferred pricing (as a current contract change order).ESA and ENA should discuss whether or not either party wants to buy some of the new LM 6000's that are now available for delivery between January - March, 20001.   Does ENA want to substitute any of these for LM 6000's currently on hand and not allocated to ESA?   Is ENA earmarking four additional LM 6000's on the attached list to ESA, and if so, which ones?   If not, does ESA want EECC to secure any or all of the remaining units required, which we can do quickly, off the balance sheet.My perception is that there is confusion and not clear direction, I recommend that both of you have a discussion and establish a clear definition of what we are doing with the LM 6000's and whether either of you want to entertain the purchase of the new LM 6000's.   Let me know if I can help.LI3444000 \n"

Enron North America and Fidelity will agree to a back to back Put/Call option whereby after closing the sale to PNE Enron has a 6 month Call option (thru 6/30/01) to cash them out at the contract price (=$5.2MM less PV10 of accrued tax credits to date).   For the period of July 1-31, 20001 Fidelity would have a Put option at the same price.This accomplishes the following:Preserves $5MM cash for Enron by allowing us 6 months to find a new buyer for the tax credits and doing a back to back flip.Preserves the integrity of the tax credits for cal 20001 (Gasco and Genco have to be unaffiliated) which will maximize our ability to recover our costs/minimize losses.Gives Fidelity a date certain when they're out of the deal AND gives them optionality to stay in if they choose.Gets the deal between Ecogas and PNE done structurally to PNE's satisfaction.I spoke w/ Donahue about internal approvals and since Enron is already exposed for the $5.2MM, and the balance can only go down (not up), we didn't feel this would need anything other than ENA Legal and Office of the Chairman.   I'll assume this is correct unless I'm told otherwise.\n"

It appears their   UK coal fired assets (Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge) are for sale.   We should consider contacting them to determine their interest to divest any part of their US generation asset portfolio as well.EME owns the former Comed coal and gas fired assets in Chicago, and Homer City in Pa.   In addition they have small coal fired generation assets in West Virginia and Virginia.   It may be possible to pick up one or more coal fired generation assets from Mission, and expand their existing capacity.We are continuing to work on identifying brown field coal fired sites.   This may be another approach to pursue as well.   Let me know if you think we need to work EME.   Thanks.\n"

However, I would caution that real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.   For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based on gas being on the margin.   Now that was before a lot of the run up so it may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.   As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a Wall Street point of view.   We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia assets. Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's point of view...Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view.

The Contingent Payments are in the form of a residual preferred partnership interest that we will retain and are discounted at the current project rate with a probability adjustment.

With respect to EPC price, the range in the DASH text indicates EPC Price range reported to us by the deal team without the contingency.   Dan Leff has changed the DASH to reflect a range with the $10 million contingency.   For modelling purposes, we have used the following aggregated values in our probabilistic evaluation to account for the EPC Contract Price and a $10 million hard cost contingency:   ($000s)P5   $194.25P50 (expected)   $210.000   P95   $2225.752.   With regard to schedule, I am told that EE&amp;CC has a copy of the Consortium Agreement where this information is contained.   I retrieved this information from that document.   I have attached a copy of the Consortium Agreement.   I hear your points and understand the risk.   The schedule will be driven by receipt of the necessary permits.   If the permitting process does not proceed as expected, I recommend that EWS/Americas Management reconsider the incremental investment in the project.   On-going dialogue between EWS/Americas and EE&amp;CC will be essential in determining the continued viability of the schedule.   Enron owns 25% of CEG and does not have control---I would recommend that we consult with Enron legal on this question.3.   It is prudent to restrict expenditures to $15 million until we receive our permits given this is the maximum recoverable amount from Petrobras.   From a permitting perspective, we are unable to commence construction of the plant beyond site clearance without the actual environmental and installation permits anyway, so whether or not we place a $15 million constraint on expenditure, the absence of permits will not allow for further construction.   An issue comes along with respect to long-lead items and whether these should be ordered in advance of permit issuance.   Our understanding is that the $15 million figure was derived with the assistance of EE&amp;CC and takes into consideration funding required for long-lead items.4.   The 9169 btu/kwh is assumed to be LHV in the model.5.   The Consortium Agreement anticipates a 92% availability for maximum payout of the capacity payment.   The capacity payment is discounted ratably to the extent the Equivalent Availability Factor is less than 92% as per Schedule 8.06 in the Consortium Agreement.With regard to future co-ordination, please designate an individual to be placed on the circulation for all DASHs in the future.   I will ensure that a DASH is provided within a time frame appropriate for response and discussion.Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.Regards,ChipTo: david.gorte@enron.com, Chip Schneider/NA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT (AKA \"ELECTROBOLT\")fyi, please respond, tx rick---",
        " Rick Buy/HOU/ECT on 12/19/2000 10:26 AM ---Larry L Izzo@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/19/2000 10:04 AMTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Richard Leibert/HOU/EEES@EES Subject: DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT (AKA \"ELECTROBOLT\")Rick, I was provided a copy of the DASH at 6:30 PM last evening and asked to sign off soonest.   My comments follow:Cost:   the DASH is incorrect.   EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and a guaranteed price.EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM.EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.   We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.   Since last week, the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.   It is unlikely that the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.   $202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of overruns and schedule.   This would require the Owner to maintain a contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM.After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the numbers I saw last week.Schedule:   Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.   The ability of Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 20002 if the project is not completed due to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not totally impossible.   Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 20002, termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force majeure.   This is considered more of an onerous risk.   It's not clear to me whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company.On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 20001 start-up, is reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.   If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to $15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk.Performance:   The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears correct, if it is LHV.O&amp;M Guarantee:   The DASH is not clear on what O&amp;M availability guarantee Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.   I would suggest that OEC insure it agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras agreement.Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the RAC needs improvement.   In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma against the PPA.   This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of experience.   The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.   I suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.Regards,LarryLI546000\n"

The action makes Massachusetts the first state to require olderplants to meet the same emissions standards as new facilities. The reducedemissions will be in place as soon as 20003, according to MassachusettsGovernor Paul Cellucci's (R) office.   The state approached the six plants and asked them to either reducetheir emissions or face regulatory action by the Department ofEnvironmental Protection. Cellucci said, \"We challenged these power plantsto clean up their act, and they have answered our call to meet the mostcomprehensive air emissions standards in the United States.\"   The agreement --- which the five operators of the six plants agreedto with the state --- is voluntary, but enforceable rules will follow.   Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift explained that the agreementresulted through \"cooperative efforts,\" but added, \"We will pursue newregulations through the Department of Environmental Protection to ensurethe plant owners' commitments are enforceable, and will require thefinalization of a detailed plan for each of the six facilities.\"   The regulations, which are expected to be proposed in the next fewmonths --- will set standards of 1.5 ponds of nitrogen oxide and 3 pounds ofsulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour.   The five companies --- including Sithe Energies, Inc., NRG EnergyInc., PE&amp;E, Western Massachusetts Electric Companies/ Northeast Utilities,and Southern Company/Southern Energy New England, LLC --- have submittedpreliminary plans. Under the plans, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxideemissions would be slashed by up to 50 percent, and mercury, particulateand carbon dioxide pollution would be curbed.   \"Our Air Quality Improvement Plan demonstrates that environmentalexcellence works in today's competitive market,\" said James McGowan, seniorvice president of Sithe. \"This is a win-win program that will produce thebest power plant for Sithe, the local communities and the environment as awhole.\"   The statement counters many other utilities' position on the issue,particularly the Midwestern coal-fired plants subject to a massive EPAenforcement action initiated late last year to have the facilities useupgraded pollution control technology. Specifically, the lawsuit chargesthe utilities with noncompliance with New Source Review requirements of theClean Air Act.   The Massachusetts situation \"does undercut the arguments ofdirtier, Midwestern companies that claim it can't be done,\" said FrankO'Donnell, with Clean Air Trust.   Pat Hemlepp, spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of theutilities involved in the EPA lawsuit, argued, however, \"that is likecomparing apples to oranges.\"   Though Northeastern states blame the Midwest for pollutionmigrating in their air, Hemlepp explained that since there are no seriousproblems with non-attainment with CAA regulation in the Midwest, strictercontrols on utilities operating in that part of the country areunnecessary. \"States like Massachusetts have every right to go in and askutilities within their state to upgrade. There are major non-attainmentproblems in the Northeast, so it makes sense,\" Hemlepp argued.   And about EPA's lawsuit, \"What people overlook is that EPA'slawsuit is not about emissions, it's about what is and isn't legal underthe Clean Air Act. ... We feel very strongly that what we've done islegal,\" Hemlepp said. \n"

All Rights Reserved   Some of the nation's largest electric utilities have secretlyfunneled millions of dollars through two front groups---one headed bywell-known conservative leaders to appeal to Republicans, the otheraffiliated with unions---to stop Congress from deregulating theirindustry.   The campaign, which at times was run out of the offices of theutilities' CEOs, was so secret that some Washington lobbyists forthese same companies were kept in the dark about many of itsactivities, according to documents stamped \"confidential\" by theeffort's organizers.   The documents offer an inside view of the industry'sclandestine efforts to wage its political battle through newly mintedentities with innocuous-sounding names. While the use of such groupshas become a common device in lobbying campaigns, it is rare to obtaina detailed operator's manual for such an effort, complete with candidassessments of individual lawmakers' vulnerabilities and specificbudgets for waging grass-roots campaigns in their districts.   Although the two groups---the conservative Citizens for StatePower and the liberal Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance---haveadvertised heavily against deregulation, until now only those involvedin the effort knew the organizations were the creation of the samenetwork of utilities. This network believed using seeminglyindependent surrogates made their case more believable and shieldedthem from political risk.   A 19998 memo said the utilities ran the groups in anarm's-length way described as \"discreet, guarded and highlyconfidential. . . . Fear of congressional reprisals conditioned thisstyle. . . . It would be prudent to avoid rash openness.\"   Their ongoing \"grass roots\" lobbying campaign was designed toinfluence members of Congress by whipping up hometown ferment withradio ads directing listeners to call \"1-8000-BAD-BILL\" and telephonebanks wired to connect angry home district residents to congressionaloffices.   The goal of the operation, on which the utilities spent $17million over the last 3 1/2 years, was to bottle up legislation in asingle congressional panel, the House Commerce Committee's energy andpower subcommittee.   The utilities' stealth campaign is one reason energyderegulation legislation has been stalled, although last fall onepartial deregulation bill was reported to the full committee. CommerceChairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr. (R-Va.) is a staunch industry criticdetermined to move a bill.   The documents describe meetings in Washington steak houses suchas Sam &amp; Harry's where utility lobbyists and consultants shapedstrategies for stopping Bliley. The dozen or so participants in theoperation---who called their effort \"The Project\"---address each otherin the memos with the kind of blunt talk that isn't often found incivics textbooks.   \"The trendline is ominous in that a spirit of accommodation andcompromise is definitely taking hold,\" said one document in 19998, whenthe utilities feared Bliley was winning over committee colleagues.\"The number one goal of 'The Project' has always been to bottlenecklegislation.\"   The participants speak of the need to \"demonize\" the federalagency that regulates utilities and to use debates about nuclear poweras \"a highly provocative wedge issue\" to destabilize legislativeadversaries.   The memos were given to The Washington Post by deregulationadvocates, and participants in \"The Project\" confirmed theirauthenticity.   The effort has outraged some congressional advocates of powerderegulation. Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.)---whom the conservativefront group, Citizens for State Power, attacked in home district radioads last year---said it is \"bogus\" for a group to claim theconservative mantle by protecting big utilities.   \"They're wearing a conservative hat, but they ought to bewearing a profit-making hat,\" said Largent. \"The best interest ofconservatives is to create competition.\"   Citizens for State Power (CSP) is headed by two leading lightsof the conservative movement---anti-tax and Republican activist GroverNorquist, and David Keene, chairman of the American ConservativeUnion---and is run day-to-day by a veteran GOP operative, CraigShirley. It denied for years that it took industry funds, but inrecent years acknowledged taking some such money while offering nodetails.   The Electric Utility Shareholders Alliance (EUSA) also wascreated by utility funds, with the International Brotherhood ofElectrical Workers kicking in small sums. It acknowledged some of itsutility backers a few years ago but uses populist language to arguethat federal deregulation would cause layoffs and hurt mom-and-poputility shareholders.   The documents detail how the Washington political consultantswho run \"The Project\" call into action one or another of these twogroups depending on circumstances. They used the right-leaning CSP tobroadcast ads criticizing Largent in his conservative Tulsa districtand employed the more liberal EUSA to air commercials against Rep.Rick White (R-Wash.), who a year later lost his seat representing amore moderate Seattle district.   In its effort to stymie federal deregulation, \"The Project\" attimes argued both sides of an issue before different audiences. Itsparticipants told environmentally minded legislators that variousderegulation bills weren't aggressive enough in reducing utilitypollution but dispatched others to argue to pro-business members thatCongress should not threaten deep emissions cuts.   While energy deregulation is an arcane concept to the public,it is an extraordinarily high-stakes struggle for the nation's $3000billion-a-year power industry. The battle pits investor-ownedutilities against large manufacturers that want cheap power andindependent power companies, such as Enron Corp., that want to competewith utilities. For one House Commerce subcommittee markup last year,lobbying firms paid temp workers to wait in line outside the hearingroom for two days so the firms would have seats at the markup.   Most investor-owned utilities don't want the federal governmentto deregulate their businesses and introduce competition. Theseutilities say that if need be, they prefer that state legislatures andstate utilities commissions do the job because they are lessheavy-handed than federal officials. So far 26 states have taken thestep.   Deregulation advocates say that the state efforts result in aconfusing regulatory checkerboard and that federal action would lowerenergy prices and encourage investment in clean energy sources.   Many top GOP leaders were eager to deregulate utilities whenthey took over Congress in 19995, seeing it as a test of a bedrockconservative principle: opening the marketplace to competition.   Within months, a group of utilities sprang into action,organized by a law firm with a thriving utility practice. The firm,which now goes by the name Ryan, Phillips, Utrecht &amp; MacKinnon,enlisted several existing clients and, later, numerous other firms.   Soon, the firm had brought in nine utilities that paid from$3000,000 to $7000,000 a year to fund \"The Project\" during the yearsthey participated. The main corporate participants, the documentssaid, were Carolina Power &amp; Light, Florida Power &amp; Light, TexasUtilities, Illinois-based Commonwealth Edison, Reliant Energy(formerly called Houston Industries), Ohio-based First Energy,Michigan-based Consumers Energy, Florida-based TECO and Union ElectricCo. in Missouri.   \"The Project\" was run by law firm partner Jeffrey MacKinnon, aformer top aide to Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the Housesubcommittee; and Tim Ridley, a former Democratic staff member inCongress who now runs a firm specializing in \"grass roots\" lobbyingcampaigns.   They and the utilities ran the two front groups and supervisedmore than 50 \"mobilizations\" in congressional districts, in whichradio aids were aired. Banks of trained telephone operators arrangedfor home district residents to send telegrams or place calls tocongressional offices. The groups also arranged for influentialcitizens in the members' home towns to spread their message---includingthe car dealers who sold members their cars.   While most of the ads were not particularly negative, othersused sarcasm or debatable statistics to attack their targets.   The one broadcast against Largent said he was favoring \"Boston,bureaucrats and biomass\" because the House member had joined with Rep.Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) on a measure that industry officials saidcould have required utilities to use alternative energy sources. Amemo from late 19998, six months before the campaign, gave a taste ofthe utilities' displeasure with him, describing the firms as \"highlyalarmed by Largent's obtuseness\" and noting they \"could make Largent'slife very uncomfortable.\"   Some congressional Republicans hold Citizensfor State Powerpartially responsible for defeating White, who lost his swing seat toa Democrat, Jay Inslee. A year before the November 19998 election, thegroup aired an ad saying White wanted to raise utility rates by 35percent, and it also circulated a poll and memo among politicalprofessionals showing that White would be beaten easily, in partbecause of his embrace of deregulation.   \"For the first time in this debate there were palpablepolitical consequences for appearing to support\" deregulation, a June19998 document said. \"In the case of Rick White, those consequenceswere direct and career threatening.\"   White said he doubted the ads played much role in his defeat,but he recalls his unease at realizing a GOP group was targeting him.   \"I was a loyal member of the Republican cause, and this was acase of shooting a friend in the foot,\" he said.http:///www.washingtonpost.comFolder Name: EmissionsRelevance Score on Scale of 1000: 78___To review or revise your folder, visit http:///www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 8000-369-74666.

At the risk of not being able to get either closed, I went out on the limb and sent Whitt to negotiate and close Wind River ($72 MM) while I negotiated and closed Powder River ($75 MM).it was my idea to create Enron Midstream Services and develop a gathering business in the Powder. That decision enable us to hedge our firm transport decision on Fort Union and enabled us to receive $54 million for the sale of the businessI made the   call and initiated the joint bid between Northern Border and ENA to acquire a combined 49% interest in Bighorn Gas Gathering.   We sold our interest to NBP for $222 MMI initiated the discussions, structured the transaction, negotiated the value and closed Project 20/20 with NBP.   There was a point in the negotiations where it was known that I was going with NBP and therefore had to take a neutral position.   However, by that time, the value had been established and many contentious issues regarding valuation had been agreed uponit was my call to preserve value in the transaction and have myself and a team of 12 others go over to NBP versus have them deduct the cost associated with a Management Services Agreement from the purchase price.   This saved ENA over $20 MM in value.   Needless to say, we are now having to deal with managing a highly aggressive budget and adjust to a very different management style and compensation plan. I feel personally that ENA was the primary beneficiary of the higher valuation.   As you can appreciate, I have a personal issue with this and would like this to be considered for bonus determination.In general, I think Project 20/20 was just part of my contribution to ENA during my tenure in Denver.   In total, this office has generated in excess of $150 million in earnings with no remaining risk potential.   I have been fortunate to have hired a solid team that approached many of the projects we worked on in a team manner.   I think that approach has been successful and I am hopeful that major contributors on the team will be compensated appropriately.I appreciate your consideration Dave!   Please let me know if you have any questions or thoughts regarding this e-mail.Brian \n"

The advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different states of development and application of business strategies.The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business experience and corresponding strategy.I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our business.

Before we distribute to others, Rick Buy and I thought we should check in with you on the distribution list which is included on the letter attached to the snapshots. (also attached below)   You may recall that last quarter we cut down the distribution considerably by requiring anyone who wanted a book to contact us.   The people on the attached list were those that specifically requested a book.   One other thing to note:   this time we have included overall portfolio and return numbers in the front of the book.   This may affect your decision on how you want the book distributed within ENA.Your advice on additions/deletions to the distribution list is appreciated.   If you have questions, please give me a call.   Regards,   Rick C.\n"

I know you have a lot more important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications (if any) it might be worth discussing.Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in any new opportunities that come about.Thanks!Mike\n"

These reports were the result of a Commission order earlier this summer.   Enron's Federal regulatory staff (Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller (who recently joined FERC from PG&amp;E Gen).   While the Commission is under no obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.   Importantly, Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the Southeast and Midwest --- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement for several years:Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of interconnection requests.While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of complaints.The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and procedures.Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports and exports.RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well as standardized criteria for curtailment.   In addition, since even such standardized criteria might not \"get to the root of the problem\" --- that control area still control generation --- the Commission could require that each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.   Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could standardize ATC and TTC methodology.Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as \"different,\" with a reaction of price caps.   Staff encourages that basic decisions about the regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the commodity and services.   DETAILS   (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):Midwest:   The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission Providers (\"TPs\") that control transmission, generation and load.   \"As such, they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services.\"   Staff received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated incidents or wide-spread.   At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.   TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an \"enormous\" increase in 2000.   The region showed a decline in peak load from 1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 19998 price spikes.   Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.   The TLRs were highly concentrated:   only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.   Notably, even though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.   The total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are not posted.   Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.   While the Commission has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open Access Transmission Tariffs (\"OATT\") where the Commission has the power to enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, including the propriety of TLRs.TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market because load is not served by the least cost supplier.   TLR procedure is an inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints --- curtailment by fiat.   In addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased loading on the affected flowgate.   The impact could be mitigated by one control area per RTO.Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for price caps following the 19998 price spikes.   Some market participants believe that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction increased in the Midwest.   Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for service.   Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and discriminatory conduct.   Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs were called, and import/export data.   This lack of data creates a market inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully analyze market conditions in real time.   As such, the market is risk adverse, eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.   Staff also noted that because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the IOU.   (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, \"Transmission Markets, Stretching the Rules for Fun and Profit.\")Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.   Examples were provided to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and native load.   These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security coordinator functions.   Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.   The result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.   Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.   Staff is weighing follow-up options.   The result of these problems is a lack of liquidity.Staff next noted the problems with unfiled \"business practices,\" especially on the next hour market.   Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas of non-compliance.   Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow input data.   TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information transparent because of native load.   This incentive will still exist under RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.   ***   \"As a consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption and have all transactions under the same tariff.\"   ***   The Commission could benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.Interconnection Issues:   IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.   Also, Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.   One solution is to have the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have against IPPs.   The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the region.Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the Entergy source and sink order.   The Commission has relied on \"passively\" receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.   While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, there is evidence of discriminatory instances.Southeast:   The traditional vertically integrated utility (\"VIU\") model has largely persisted in the SE.   This continued control has vastly reduced the economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.   In many cases, the VIUs have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and manipulation of ATC.   TPs have shown little inclination to improve the transmission system and use many TLRs.There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development of markets in the SE.   ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the SE.   This is significant because of TVA's size and location.   IPPs have reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform interconnection studies.In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this summer.   Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.   Peak prices were radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.   SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to extensively increase sales.   (Less used than in the midwest.)The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE (including ATC and TLRs).   Market participants seem to have less confidence in the SE market than in any other market region.   This appears to be justified based on Staff's investigations.   This lack of confidence discourages investment and participation in the markets.   Staff concludes that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.   The investigation found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.   In addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.   Staff thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.   Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access information.The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.   In addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to interconnect.   Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the construction of an 80 mile 5000 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.   Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.   SERC coordination of a standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without direction from the Commission.   An improved method and improved communication are needed.The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.   This increase raises the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive operation of the market in the SE.   Staff cites information provided by Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC criteria.   Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.   RTOs must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.   In addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.   However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated weighs heavily on the value of this information.   This is an issue that the formation of RTOs may not resolve.   Eliminating native load exceptions --- ie, treating all load equally --- and placing all transactions under the same tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision of transparent and standardized information.Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&amp;L, TVA is a \"problem area\" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.   TVA is a transmission bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.   The current federal law and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of deep and robust power markets in this area.   TVA simply has no strong incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.   In addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.   Staff lists a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park power.   Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.A Staff audit of FP&amp;L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including confidential information on FP&amp;L's transmission system (including interchange information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to FPL's merchant function.   Staff's report found that FP&amp;L does not have an established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not displayed in error.   It is \"up to individual Managers discretion.\"   (((FRCC web site report dated 9/8/000))).   Violations such as these undermine competition.The reports are attached below. - southeast.pdf - midwest.pdf\n"

Policy on Noncompetition.   I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2.Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).   Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.   The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a \"dumping ground\" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.   As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates.   The following is a summary of these competition provisions:Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.   If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.   Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&amp;M, offtaker or risk management services.There are a number of exceptions to this rule:   (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; &amp;copy; projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction.\"Affiliates\" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).\"Asia Pacific Region\" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 20003.Thank you,Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI\n"

The tone was positive, and they said Goldman was very bullish on the whole story.   All these guys acknowledge that without our Trading stamp on NewCo, NewCo will not be a world class Genco.   With that said, it is apparent that Lew is telling these guys to go back and get more EXACT detail on what exactly Enron is willing to do in terms of people (both Trading and Risk Management). I would have to believe that a conversation between you and Lew would go a long way in making him comfortable that we are truly committed to NewCo, particularly with $4000-$5000 million of equity tied up in this entity.   Apparently we have to arm Lew with everything that he needs to go to Broadhead to argue why NewCo makes sense and why they need Enron in this entity.   I have tried to convince these guys that while Trading is people, it is also philosophy, style and approach.   Given that we have said that we would nominate the Head Trader, I have tried to convey that we might be looking to utilize a lot of FPLE T&amp;M people, but immerse them in our philosophy.   They are not comfortable with this, and have informed me that coming back with the answer that we will only put one Enron person in Trading is probably not the right answer.   Given the dynamic nature of Enron and Trading in general,   making a huge commitment of people I would imagine will be tough.We talked through many other aspects including whether they think that they can do an IPO without us; the fact that having our involvement clearly increases the value of NewCo (raises an interesting question about how we get adequately compensated for this);   tight labor market in general and the fact that we don't have unlimited human resources here at Enron; and that in the early years, NewCo has very little merchant generation, and that all of it is FPLE 's (implies fewer people needed, and that we should be able to utilize FPLE Traders).   We also discussed the rumor about FPL's interest in Aquilla.Sorry to bog down your vacation with this.   If you want to talk today, I will be around.Thanks,Don 713-853-0492 (ph)713-412-8967 (cell)\n"

I think it will take a one on one with Lew to get this one centered.At our meeting, I would also like a status update on the other iniatives eg) Ameren, DPL, Cinergy, etc.The accounting issues on the generation projects need to be addressed as well.RegardsDelainey---"

The meetings were productive, and we are making progress.   Lew has instructed these guys to get down into a lot of detail on the business plan/core competencies, which we did!They also floated the valuation of their existing assets - $3.1B for 3947 MWs or $789/kW.   We walked them through our peaker valuation as well.   We didn't debate the valuations, but rather we decided to go ahead and have Clement and Jinsung try to pull together a consolidated model for NewCo.   That is being done, and should be ready Monday/Tuesday. It is apparent from these meetings that they are looking for ENRON to provide several key pieces to NewCo (other than peakers and dev. projects):1. Enron culture and emphasis on intellectual capital (including HR approach).2. Trading and marketing expertise.3. Enron style finance.4. Select management spots.5. Supplement development team.The interesting debate is how we get compensated for the significant impact that the Enron \"halo\" is going to have on NewCo's IPO ( particularly if we deliver the items listed above).   I raised this incremental value issue with them.FPL's key pieces include:1. Core \"operating\" competencies and asset management techniques.2. Construction management techniques.3.   Select management spots.4.   National development team.The FPL risk in this whole exercise is if Lew is unsuccessful in convincing Broadhead that owning some % of NewCo is not a better value proposition that owning 1000% on FPLE; and/or the decision to wait until Florida deregulates before spinning out FPLE.   Glenn Smith stopped by last week and he highlighted these issues as well.We have a lot of work to do this week including a need to determine Trading &amp; Marketing model; develop potential services agreements (QF, back office); refine our financial model and expand to include new projects, turbine capx, etc.; expand development framework;   pull pitch together to float NewCo by investment bank, etc...I am happy to expand on exactly where we stand with FPL.   I guess we also need to think about staffing if both Cinergy and FPL move forward (let's just sell the peakers to Cinergy for $1.25B and let them do their own IPO).Regards,Don\n"

Of course, like Enron, we'rewilling to be flexible, depending on what we find out. Since it began in 1985, Enron has always been in the vanguard of U.S.companies getting into new markets overseas, from India, where the companymade the largest single private investment in the country's history, toJapan where the company recently announced it will build its first powerplant. How has the company overcome political obstacles and culturaldifferences to establish itself internationally? This will focus more on South America than the rest of the world. I'llookat the transition from working on pipeline projects in South America to themore service-oriented business in Argentina. Also, what about workers - doyou hire local management and oversee the operations from Houston? IF so,why? I'll also look at the pipeline and the creation of this natural gasmarket in South America. How did the project ultimately turn out forresidents &amp; customers there? What does Enron see in its future in SouthAmerica.I know this is pretty vague, but I expect to do more research in the comingweeks and have it more ironed out.jena(713)2220-7208---Original Message---From: Keith.Miceli@enron.com [mailto:Keith.Miceli@enron.com]Sent: Monday, December 111, 2000 5:25 PMTo: jena.moreno@chron.comSubject: Fact Sheets on Enron Assets in SA---",

We exchanged 2 drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 999% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 20001.   Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would be extinguished.   However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.   The way the deal w/ Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close (est to be $3000K+/-).   Fidelity wants 2 things:protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits accrued (i.e., the $3000K), andprotection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they were a partner in LGI (June, 2000 thru Jan, 20001).There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a specific cap on the tax credit amount ($3000K+/-) and with the same environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to issues which occurred while they were a partner.   The probability of either ever being triggered is extremely remote.   Replacing the benefactor from LGI to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.   Per ENA accounting since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance sheet item.The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty \"in hand\" and unless you give me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any leverage to get them to release it.   They are willing to work with us on either of the 2 alternatives listed above.   This is the only remaining commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.Please advise or call to discuss further.   Ext. 333212.   Thanks!RANDY\n"

I had agreed with Jana that swapping the dates of the Analysts and Associates PRC meetings was a great solution.   Despite the fact that the program had not checked with us as PRC reps to see if December 13 was a convenient date, Charlene developed an interesting concern over potentially inconveniencing the directors who are PRC reps for the Analyst PRC.   And I see that you were drafted into facilitating the whole meeting!   I am scheduled on the 5:35 flight from IAH to Las Vegas on the afternoon of the 13th.   I would have to leave downtown by 4:15 to make that flight.   I have been asked to confirm those flight arrangements so that a ticket can be issued.   Since you will be in charge, will this flight time work?   ---Sally \n"

When the deal was closed, west power trading booked an in the money position and an offsetting expense of about $111 million.   This money has already liquidated from our book.   In fact, I have a copy of the 3/31/97 DPR that reflects this liquidation.   At that time, west power trading also paid a 350k credit reserve, 247k to the finance book, and 1.3 million in origination.   I have also heard about a \"partnership\" fee that Enron paid to Fort James around the same time.   I'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from it.   It had nothing to do with the west power trading book.On John's recommendation I called Wes to see if we could figure this out.   Wes, please give me a call back to discuss.   I think that someone needs to look at the actual journal entries from March of 19997 to see why an expense of $111 million was deferred.This is not my problem.   I should not receive this expense.   Until this is resolved, I would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred account does not hit west power trading's expenses.\n"

As you are aware, I sued them for breach.   The settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.   It is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.   It seemed logical to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability.Lets discuss.RegardsDelainey---"

My gut feel is that John has forecasted more turbines than we will need (which is OK).   The GE planning Boys called John and asked him to check with Enron... and determine if Enron wanted any turbines in the 20002/20003 timeframe (the previous assumption being 7F's wouldn't be available till 4Q03, and 7EA's wouldn't be available till 1Q03).   John stated that he didn't know what the request from Schenectady meant..., but..., maybe a few production slots were coming available as things shake out...   John told them that he thought Enron might be interested in:qty 4 7EA's and qty 4 7F's for ESAqty 2 7EA's and qty 2 7F's for Mexicoqty 6 7EA's and qty 6 7F's for NAJohn is asking us..., \"that would be enough... right?\".   We don't need to change that input (from John Schroeder to Schenectady) if we want less than he forecasted, but..., if someone knows something I don't, and..., we would want more turbines than the above..., please let us know.   On an immediate basis, John also stated that he had requests in for turbines for Saudi, and..., \"an island project\".   Regards - F.Kelly\n"

Chip Schneider and I have agreed that this approach allows us to get to NTP on the project (up until August 20), or determine a higher-valued use for the turbine in the event the development does not get finalized for some reason.   Given the strength of the PNW market, this project is in the money using Enron mid curves for gas and power.   Mike Miller has appropriately backed away - my team is engaged directly with GE on the contract negotiation and a term sheet is expected to be signed tomorrow.I am highly confident that this will result in a 20001 gain of $15MM-$20MM.

The deal value is roughly $4-5 million NPV of which $3-4 million may be markable income.   The obstacles to closure are:- the projected savings have gone from 27% to 20% when GE said they wanted more- there is some capital recovery at the end of year ten that GE would have to pay us and they are not yet agreeable to,- the savings include $1 million in O&amp;M savings and it will be very difficult to get to closure with them letting us do the O&amp;MDeal Stats Are:Electricity   230,000 mwh/yr   $12 million/yrSteam   430,000 lbs/yr   $3   million/yrGas   470,000 mmbtu/yr $2   million/yrO&amp;M   $3   million/yrTotal   $20 million/yr10 year contract, total contract value $2000 million.Let me know if you need any further information.Thanks,Rodney   \n"

This has been sold through GE for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so.Ultimately, Rodney and his team would like to see EES take control of the deal with EIM folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure. Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some value for Enron to take this deal including: a) $2000 M in TCV for 2000; b) $3 to $5 M in value; c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an \"in\" to the GE family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.RegardsDelainey---"

We came away with a broad T&amp;M outline.   One concern that Kevin raised is our ability to actually do a \"services agreement\" for the risk management and back offices aspect of NewCo.   Apparently, he said a number of issues have bubbled up recently with our systems in terms of manpower, age of system, and ability to take on additional load.   He said throwing on an incremental 4000-5000 MWs with NewCo may prove to be too much to handle.   He also raised the \"confidentiality issue\".   It is his view that NewCo should have this capability in-house anyway (obviously that was always the long term intent, with this services agreement more a bridge).Several options exist.1.   Force a 12-24 month services agreement through the system (solve our problems with more people, etc).2.   Agree to set up NewCo's system using our unique expertise and experience. We would do this for a fee (say $15MM?).   One issue here is just NewCo's ability to get this done in conjunction with everything else in time to do IPO.3. Investigate what type of system FPLe is using today.   Since we are not increasing net merchant MWs on day 1, FPLe's system could serve as the platform for future MW expansion.   Maybe Enron comes in and expands/redesigns system for a fee?   I believe that FPLe has just recently expanded/updated their system.   I would like to try to learn more about their system.Let me know if you have a preference or any additional thoughts.   I think we can make money off of all three options.Thanks,Don\n"

Their attendance does form part of the discussions on the VPs and MDs at the executive PRC.Despite repeated comms from the OTC, these 37 names have not yet enrolled (or cancelled off a programme and have not re-enrolled). HR has committed to making sure that these people are enrolled, so the suggestion is that the named HR rep in the attachment takes 5 minutes to meet with the individuals, explain that they need to do this, show them the list of dates, and get them to choose which programme they want to enrol on. Please do not leave that meeting without a date!

The shrapnel caused unreparable damage to 3 additional blades.   From the pictures, it appears that one of the damaged blades was close to breaking off, and likely would have caused much more significant damage to the compressor AND turbine.We've begun the process of removing the damaged blades.   Westinghouse has the repair lead, and so far, is giving it the right level of attention.   My plant manager's driving the effort on the ground, but I have a compressor engineer that will be at the site tomorrow to serve as my eyes and ears so Pete can concentrate on keeping the other two units running.Barring as-yet undiscovered damage (doubtful), my best guess is that we lose next week, but get the unit back for the week of 24 July.   This hinges on Westinghouse securing four replacement blades which they are scrambling to do.   All costs should fall on Westinghouse warranty.I'm collecting the information we might need in order to file a business process interruption insurance claim, but based on my best-guess schedule, I don't expect to file the claim.Mitch\n"

Bob told me this in the context of asking me whether Calpine would sell us any additional combined cycle equipment (i.e., steam turbines).   My guess is they won't.If 1) it was of interest to us and 2) we are really going to convert Gleason, I think I could get Calpine to execute a purchase/short term tolling transaction on Gleason on favorable terms.   I say this for the following reasons:1.   Calpine is typically a strong bid for combined cycle installations.2.   Calpine has been trying unsuccessfully to get a combined cycle project in TVA (due to their rank in the cue) and thinks that it will take them a year to get through TVA.   We actually think that their project is blocked. 3.   Calpine would likely take the incremental construction cost risk on the transaction.4.   I believe that Calpine would undertake the permitting and interconnection work at their cost   and risk, if needed.   Given the cost of preparing a combined cycle permit along with the potential fight that ENA might face from TVA in such an effort, this risk sharing scenario could be attractive to ENA.5.   Calpine would likely accept a short term tolling arrangement.   On their eastern assets, Calpine is generally executing 1-2 year deals.6.   Calpine particularly in the east has been aggressively purchasing projects.7.   If feasible, Calpine would probably be willing to further increase the size of Gleason.   Calpine's current plants announcements are generally in the 7000-1,000 MW range.I know that Dave Delainey has not previously supported selling Gleason individually.   However, you may want to investigate if anything has changed in this circumstance, particularly since we are not generally a strong bid for combined cycle projects.   Please let me know. FYI---Dave Duran and I are meeting with Bob Kelly of Calpine on next Tuesday to discuss the use of Enron NOLs in Calpine's PG&amp;E contract buyouts. \n"

Although I understood from you that Goldendale was effectively done, I understand that you haven't yet gone through the dash process, so therefore a window of opportunity. We are looking to pay up to $40,000,000 for a GE 7FA for Ft. Pierce in addition to a commitment on the combined-cycle EPC contract. Our customer at Ft. Pierce is heavily engaged in finalizing contracts and will be prepared to execute in December. We must be able to commit to them (showing title to the que position) by then. I'd like you to compare your anticipated earnings on the Goldendale deal with earnings from moving this turbine to Florida. The $40 million should give you app. $3 million above cost, as well as incremental profits from the EPC contract. Also, you should know that we feel the Florida market has significant upside potential for Enron from a merchant standpoint and anticipate that our first-mover advantage will result in significant earnings.Please let me know how you think Enron should proceed in comparing the two projects. Thanks Dick.\n"

ENA could trade this turbine to several parties (Tenaska, Indeck) to get a lock on a QF restructuring.   Also, Sumas I still has restructruring value that EE&amp;CC did not get a lock on in exchange for the EPC/turbine contract. As I recall, Larry Izzo promised to replace the GE 7FA turbine with a comparable machine with a Q4-20001 delivery date.   While the Goldendale EPC contract may executed and there may be nothing to do, there is significant value sitting on the table.   If we cannot get the Goldendale 7FA back, then can we enforce the replacement provision that was promised (as I remember) as part of your original deal with Larry Izzo?   I realize that at this point the politics may prevent us from doing anything.   However, I at least want to get you thinking about it just in case there was a way to get a turbine to trade for larger value than an EPC contract for EE&amp;CC.Regards,Mike J. Miller \n"

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 02/09/20001 05:56 PM ---Richard Lydecker@ENRON02/07/20001 09:01 AMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wes Colwell/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Heartland Industrial PartnersDave, in May 2000 Enron North America committed to invest up to $30 million in Heartland Industrial Partners L.P., a private equity fund.   The terms of the fund investment are fairly typical (and not particularly exciting for a limited partner such as we).   The deal was \"sold\" on the basis of ENA getting exclusive rights to provide energy management services to companies owned by the fund if these were cost effective.   The claimed benefits for the energy management tie were calculated at $20 - 50 million.   The deal was originated by Brad Dunn who now is in EIM.   Ownership of this commitment had been assigned to Jim Ajello.The kinds of energy management services associated with this deal are now provided by EES.   While they are happy to exploit any opportunity, their business plan does not contemplate investment substantial capital in this kind of deal.   In short, they have no interest in picking up the commitment (and capital employed) via an intercompany transfer.Private equity funds such as this are highly illiquid by design and the normal investment cycle is at least 5 - 7 years.   The Heartland partnership has a 10-year life,   Enron did negotiate the right to sell its LP interest after 3 years.   As a practical matter, that right guarantees neither a fair price or even a market.There is no logical home for this investment that I know of in ENA except in my portfolio.   Question: is this an ENA responsibility or would it move to EIM's balance sheet?   If we (ENA) have no choice but to retain the investment, my group will take responsibility for it and do our best to monetize funds invested to-date (about $6 million) and sell the remaining commitment.   Since the fund itself is still marketing limited partnership interests, however, it will be extremely difficult to get out of our investment/commitment in the foreseeable future.   Under any circumstances finding a buyer will be time-consuming and expensive.   (This is a poster child for \"patient\" investment capital).I want to ensure that you are aware of the situation in case your view is that the obligation should be transferred to EIM which I believe has assumed the charter of the ENA group that formerly managed this investment.   Dick.   \n"
      ],
      "body": "\nRichard, it is my understanding that this investment is currently in Ray Bowen's business.   In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility.   In my EES shoes, I would like to take a closer look at the possible connections.   Please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio.I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on the Catalytica investment.   With my EES shoes on, no way!!!RegardsDelainey---"

Since the letter concerns a matter currently pending before the commission it will also be served on the parties.   We plan to talk to the press about it as well.   A number of other companies and organizations are also submitting letters and we have helped prepare an EPSA filing which focusses specifically on California.   Our best information at this point is that the FERC staff report regarding California is generally accurate, and therefore, favorable.   While it will mention periodic exercises of market power, it is expected to lay blame for California's woes at the feet of California's own decisions about market structure.   It is further expected that the report will not provide a basis for ordering refunds.   On the other hand, the Commission's order (to be considered tomorrow along with the staff's report) is expected to at least put refunds on the table for comment and to discuss, and perhaps implement, further price caps.   This is just our best guess at this point.   the Commission has put special emphasis on putting the report and order under wraps until wednesday.---",

I did not expect to have such an audience. I came seekingbusiness advice on the litigation and feel I accomplished a lot more. Iapologize for not contacting you directly, but I was unaware that you werenow responsible for all of the groups within ENA.   Congratulations !!!Here is what I came away with:LitigationGE has proposed a settlement that includes a proposed press releaseunacceptable to PSM. I have our attorneys working on drafting a response toGE and pursing the possibility of eliminating the joint press releasealtogether. If common ground cannot be reached we will pursue other legaloptions.Private PlacementThe book has been released to Enron &amp; Calpine. I understand your positionconcerning participation and the question of the ongoing litigation. I amvery open to the additional warrant option. Mike Miller talked to me aboutit after the meeting and we will discuss it next week.New Albany RetrofitI have asked my engineers to formulate a plan to upgrade the units at NewAlbany with our latest 6 ppm liners and fuel nozzles. We are currentlymanufacturing a full set for a 7EA machine. We haven't firmed up the testdates but we need to seek approval by ENA &amp; OEC to use one of the Doylemachines. This is a significant leap in technology that many of our clientsare extremely interested in. We now have the only single digit dry low Noxsystem that can be used on multiple machine types to include Westinghouse501D5A, ABB 111 N1/N2, GE F6 / F7.FT4 Mobile UnitI understand from Mike Miller you want to slow the pace down on the firstten units to \"Learn out\" the manufacturing and business process. This willease our pain level on schedule. My engineering staff is very excited withthis program because it involves aircraft engines and they can apply theirtrue skills. We just hired the program manager named George Kirsby. He iscurrently in charge of the $4 billion Joint Strike Fighter engine designprogram for Pratt Whitney / Boeing. I figure he should be able to manage themobile unit project. At some time in the near future I would like to arrangea program presentation for you in Houston. I need to give Kirsby a few weeksto get his arms around the project and will propose dates for you in thefuture. We need to expedite the formation of the Joint Venture company as weare already being approached with deals to place these units.I really value your support and you can always count on our loyalty toEnron.Best Regards,Tom ChurbuckPresidentPower Systems MFG., LLCTel:   561-347-2408 Ext 208Fax: 561-347-22257Cell: 561-213-5161tchurbuck@powermfg.comww.powermfg.com\n"

This would clearly expedite the opening of markets in the SE significantly.I think we could get an FPL, Duke, VEPCO, Entergy, Cinergy type company to provide a pre-negotiated purchase price for the transmission facilities so our capital at risk would be minimal.   Additionally, we would cut a deal with FERC on what the new market design would look like and the ultimate transmission owner would live with the market design.What are your thoughts.\n"

The agreement should look and behave very closely to what you would have signed with the competing utility. In addition, ENA is paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the term to twelve years from ten.I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction. I hope this is not the case.   The ENA team worked hard to facilitate this transaction for Enron Wind.   In fact, we were originally solicited by Enron Wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax Enron Wind to do this transaction with ENA versus TXU.I look forward to finding a solution to this current impasse.RegardsDelainey\n"

As you know, we were co-operating to the fullest extent possible with the investigating authorities, and we were confident that there was no substance to the allegations.   Accordingly, it is with great pleasure that I inform all of you that the Competition Bureau has announced in a press release, that the alleged offences under the Competition Act were unsubstantiated and that the Competition Bureau has closed the inquiry.   To quote the Competition Bureau, \"The evidence suggests that the companies were employing independent business strategies and were not colluding on bids.\"   I want to thank everyone for their co-operation in dealing with this disruptive matter.Regards,Peter\n"

Kevin Garland sent me earlier this week (via Steve Horn) a copy of the corresponding engagement letter dated 01-Dec-999 and signed by Garland and Horn (and by Richard Lewis of Bear, Stearns).   It stipulates that Bear, Stearns shall receive as fee 2% of the aggregate consideration received by ENA, or $2,582,351 (plus $25,000 in out of pocket expenses).Horn and Garland (and our accounting department) have confirmed to me that we have not previously paid any fee to Bear, Stearns for this transaction.   Given the fact that the economics of the deal accrued to the account of ENA, it is probably only fair that we pay the fee.   I have instructed Stacy Hardy in accounting to wire the money prior to year end.Sorry to hit you with this so late in the year, but I only found out about it two days ago.

He is also involved with working on the FUNAI issues a result of his efforts on the IBAMA license.   Key person.Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.   Not only does he know folks but he also gets things done within the system.Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the year after which she has been dialed out.   Have asked Rick several times about her future with his group.   She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.   He has been a key to our success on the CC account.   He is a must to making the project successful.   Knows the contacts and basically understands the project from the regulatory and CC account point-of-view.Two other people that are not involved in \"our side\" of fence on a daily basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.   Jose knows the history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.PeteJoe Kishkill111/27/2000 06:16 AMTo: Peter E Weidler/NA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: Re: Cuiaba Review   Pete,But you (or does anyone) have a definitive team list for Cuiaba?

Which shop is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight forward   decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.   I am thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.   In attendance are Rob and John.   Can divide the presentation up into - getting the construction finished/cost issues/EEECC - subcontractor issues. - Laine Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - RickMAE/ONS issues - current thinking.   - JoseCurrent economics. - RickEveryone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we send the page per topic around by this friday.   I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.Pete\n"

It sounds like their meeting went very well as they spent a few hours discussing Keyspan's situation in the Northeast market and how an Enron/Keyspan \"JV\" would work. They actually outlined a lot of ideas on the white board and it basically sounds like Chuck is very interested in pursuing this JV that would focus on optimizing Keyspan's gas, power, and fuel oil portfolios. Chuck is now planning to come to Houston in mid-January to sit down with us and further these discussions. If the Houston visit goes well we will then plan to take him to Chicago to show him first-hand the Enron/People's JV (trading floor, office set-up, discussion of general contractual arrangements between the reg. utility and unreg. affiliate, etc.). Chuck knows Tom Patrick and it would be a great way to show him how well our Chicago JV has worked for both People's and Enron. Obviously this visit and meeting will need to be tightly finessed but I'm confident that with Laura Luce/Bill Morrow and Gil, Chuck, and myself, it will work.We may want to consider getting out with Keyspan and People's together in a more social setting sometime in March (maybe the Master's would work). I think Keyspan has the ability to get out of the Coral relationship early if they really wanted to (it currently goes through April, 20002) although I think it will probably take the better part of next year to formulate the entire structure around this JV. I think the potential is to have a commercial structure in place and effective going into next winter or coinciding with the termination of the Keyspan/Coral relationship in April 20002.Okay, now the players needed to make this happen...Gil needs to be intimately involved. His knowledge of that market and company and his relationship with Devario, Anderson, Fazio, the operational folks, etc. is extremely good. If you decide that you do not want to have Gil involved in this (not a good decision) you need to move him out of his current role. Given the fact that we are using the People's JV as a showcase, Laura Luce can be very closely connected to Gil and Keyspan in a very natural and genuine way. Gil will need to lean on Laura's expertise in how she set up the Chicago JV throughout the process. I plan to insert Michael Brown into the deal team to focus on the power and fuel oil components. Michael has excellent relationships with all the folks at Keyspan and his knowledge of Keyspan's power portfolio and that power market will be critical. Ed McMichael will lead all the structuring effort (gas and maybe power too), and we'll need Bob Superty from the   operational side. Although it is still unclear as to whether Keyspan will decide to request proposals from several players, it is clear that with our overall capabilities and genuine desire to be flexible on the commercial structure in what we put together with them, Chuck Devario is very interested in pursuing more detailed discussions in the very near future. I'd like you to be available to spend some time with Chuck and I when he comes to Houston in January ( maybe   a late morning meeting and lunch) and I'll coordinate with Kay on that.Let me know if you want to talk about this ahead of time. I'll be here all next week. \n"

The total purchase price of the block is $1.7 million.   This closing is to take place tomorrow.   Given the changes, I thought I should run this by you to make sure you would be in agreement.

I graciously commend everyone for the teamwork and perseverance displayed in tackling the array of transactions and tasks to ensure the successful start of our new joint business.   We continue to have many challenges ahead, but I wanted to take pause and in particular commend the following:Trunkline Transaction Team - Roy Rodriguez, Russell Murrell, and Steve Curlee brought to closure a significant transaction with leveraged off many groups in the PEC and Enron organizations.   Net transaction mark to market on behalf of MEH was $2,286,634   with accrual and option values to be realized over the 3 year term of the arrangement.   Team work permeated this transaction and thanks are due to 1) legal teams for PEC led by Mary Klyasheff and for ENA led by Sheila Tweed and Jeff Hodge 2) structuring group support from Steve Curlee,   Deirdre McCaffrey and Ed McMichael 3) Tony Compton for the successful closure of gas supply transactions with third parties 4) to all else who covered the many transaction closing issues and bookings. NSS and NGPL Capacity Transaction Team - Steve Richman, Roy Rodriguez, Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard and Lee Fascetti successfully proposed, negotiated and are now managing a 3 year storage and capacity management of approximately 18 BCF/year of NGPL no-notice storage and accompanying transportation with realized value year to date for MEH of $1,510,459   with an additional $1,541,835   of value to PGL ratepayers.   This transaction will continue to be a significant asset to leverage into the intra-day market   and our initial platform for on-line business (EOL).Daily Optimization - Richard Tomaski, Barbara Dillard, Steve Richman, Tim Hermann, Cary Carrabine and Lee Fascetti , diligently pursued and completed other significant transactions for MEH totalling $1,252,584 for this quarter.   Richard Tomaski and Kevin Radous have spent endless amounts of time (and evenings/weekends) to ensure that MEH had a P&amp;L to represent for the groups hard work and my many thanks extend to both.Business Set-up - Tim Hermann, Roy Rodriguez, Paul Burgener, Gregg Penman, Kevin Radous, Richard Tomaksi, and Barbara Dillard have toiled diligently and continue to proceed in contracts/policy and procedures between PEC/ENA/PGL and third parties. Additional thanks are due to all groups within accounting, economics, and trading within PEC and ENA in support of this new business and we ask for your continued engagement.Over the next month, we must get closure on the remaining requirements of running a tightly managed and successful business venture.   We must continue to take our ideas and strategies to financially successful commercial operation .   Momentum is now on our side...Thanx,Laura\n"

His $250 M valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months ago.   However, Mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are expected to be booked in reserve reports next March not to mention significant increases in gas and oil prices.   Our current valuations, in the $6000M range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve growth and current energy prices.   Our current goal, is to be able to demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a significant E&amp;P concern that desires an offshore division.   The concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in Mariner make it a very poor IPO candidate (((ie) I'm not sure that an IPO was ever a viable strategy to maximize the exit value).I would recommend that we not meet to make the following points: a) Mariner is not on the market at this point in time and b)   his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.Otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to sell tha asset.I hope this meets with your approval.RegardsDelainey\n"

I spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.   Joe is a big fan of Enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.

Rick Buy must report to Skilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position... thus the current effort.   RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be keeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with input from EECC.   Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we don't have redundant list efforts going.   Matt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I think some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.   I will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.   Additionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using to track manufacturing and QA checks..., I don't think those lists are intended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.   Finally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the LM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.   I'm sure that Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were not listed).   In summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so we can remove unneccessary work.   Thanks for the note!

I had asked Dan to come up with a number they would think appropriate for terminating the trade.   I also discussed the deal with their relationship officer Robert Furst so they are all engaged.   I think Dan is simply trying to elicit a higher first bid from us without him doing any work or potentially leaving any money on the table since it is us that wants to unwind the trade.I have Rogers Herndon pulling some information on how much the position has moved since we did the deal.   I also have him working through what we would have done if we owned the deal i.e. how much gas basis risk we would have mitigated and what the value would be now as well and any other hedges we would have put on and the value of them now.   This will give us information to either negotiate or at least get a better picture of what a better offer should be.   I have also notified Elizabeth Sager, our lawyer, to dig back in and get back up to speed on the deal to prepare to discuss it.   As I see it our options are: Option 1:   NegotiateRogers/Kevin/Myself go to NY and negotiate/highlight the risks in the deal with MLOption 2: Relationship PlayEither myself or Cliff start leaning on the relationship people at ML to force ML into a more realistic first offer.   Let me know your thoughts on how you want to proceed.Rodney---",

At that time, a fee ofapproximately $17 million was charged to execute the transaction.Since the execution of the trade, Merrill Lynch has had to manage the riskassociated with the sizeable position as well as hedge certain gas basisrisks that Merrill Lynch was obligated to assume in order to accommodate theaccounting treatment desired by Enron as part of the transaction.Additionally, as I am sure that you and your traders are aware, the positionhas considerably appreciated in value since trade execution.Even with these factors, Merrill Lynch is prepared to accommodate Enron'srequest to terminate the transaction in exchange for a fee of $17 million.This fee encompasses the original fee that Enron had agreed to pay toMerrill Lynch and does not take into consideration any of Merrill Lynch'shedge breakage costs or our foregone upside in the trade.Should you wish to discuss the matter further, please do not hesitate tocontact me.Regards, as always.Dan Gordon\n"

At thesame time, I now realize that I made   a stupid mistake in turning down theEnron offer.   If you are willing to reconsider, I would love to talk to you.Considering what I put you through the last time, if you do not want toreconsider, I can understand.David, I would appreciate it I can meet with you in person to discuss thisfurther with you.

I don't know whether you are aware but we had an interviewer not show up.   He also had not called to cancel.   Michelle was in the lobby waiting to leave and became aware of the situation.   Although she had pressing business in Houston, she made arrangements to stay so that we did not have to cancel the schedule.

Employee Expenses:   We really need to try and trim the expenses where and whenever possible. Get your Assistants to make all reservations for air/hotel/car so that they can ensure the best rates for your needs. ENA (and our groups) spends an incredible amount of money on travel expenses and we really need to attempt to trim this back where we can. Efficiencies in booking can probably help a lot. That means use Vitol or TAP or whoever else if they're cheaper and give you good service. Letting your Assistants handle your travel arrangements will not only ensure the best rates, it should allow you to spend more time on more productive endeavors! 2.)   Customer trips/expenses: Any customer expense greater than $2000 must be approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman in advance of the expenditure.   Your Assistants have the forms and once you've filled them out, I need to approve/sign them before going upstairs for approval.3.)   All employee reviews should be completed by now for Directors/Managers/Associates/Analysts/ Assistants. All reviews should be written, signed by both the supervisor and employee, and given to Fran Mayes for filing.   Fran- If you have not received all written reviews by this Friday, please advise. This should include the 5 East Midstream groups and both the Gas and Power Structuring groups. We have just completed the VP PRC as of yesterday and I will be sitting down with each of the VP's for feedback over the next week.4.) We are entering the homestretch for most of our deals this year and it is extremely important that we stay completely focused on doing everything possible to bring these deals to closure. Top priorities as I see them are as follows:Ozzie Pagan:   TexMex, Alamac/Cogentrix, Green Jacket, Brazos/TenaskaJeff Ader:   NSTAR, CRRA,   Silver Oak, ConEd, NYSEGBruce Sukaly:   AES-NY, Assets (Cinergy/Wilton Plant/ Pontiac/Plano, EPNG/Wheatland, etc), AECGil Muhl:   PSEG, NJNLaura Luce:   Manlove Storage Monetization, HUB dealsBen Jacoby:   Florida Merchant Plant, Continue building optionality on Site Bank, Coal Plant developmentEd and Bernie: Continue to drive the commodity deals to closureWe're definitely set up to execute on our 2000 business plan and strategy. The above deals are our #1 priority for the rest of the year. Let's stay very well coordinated on these deals and do everything we can to drive them to closure. Elevate any internal hurdles earlier rather than later and   I'll personally handle them.There are many other deals I'd like to also see closed ( Tangerine and Ft. Pierce - George McCormick, Vepco/NC - Heather Kroll, ANP-Mark Bernstein, VNG/AGL- Ed McMichael, TXU- Jim Ducote, Energen/Haywood - Healy/Jacoby) and many others I'd like to continue to see get teed up for next year.   5.)   Please forward any information above to your groups if appropriate.Thanks!   \n"

John Malowney in our mid-market group has covered these guys very well (Frank acknowledged that).   EPMI has served this load in the past and made numerous proposals to them during the past year.   Montana rejected these, including the attached proposal that offered to fix prices well below the current forward market price.   John has also proposed various cross-commodity (copper) deals with our MG affiliate.   John will discuss their situation with Frank and I will follow up from time to time.   I do not think there is an attractive generation opportunity as Montana is net long and the industrials' credit is marginal.   We will keep you posted if anything materializes. Regards,Chris---",

I envision a one page summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set at 1000%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.   I will derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will beidentification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I don't want to provide you with something \"half-baked\".   Is it acceptable to allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provideyou with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ?

We are proceeding with the kick-off of the permit amendment, and will be using a combination of both the MCN and Calumet N2 unit data.   Per my phone message, it will take about a week or two to prepare the amendment at a cost up to $10,000 US, and then eight weeks to get the amendment.   We should be able to commence site work without the amendment, to the point of completing foundations, based on previous discussions with the Municipality, County and Ontario Ministry of Envir...Even though this work is not in our $35 MM US original DASH budget, we are planning to proceed with this unless you've got a problem with it.2.   NEPCO have preliminarily re-worked the schedule now on the N1 disassembly, move and install, and the N2 installation.   They believe they need to get on site by the third week in June to begin site clearing in order to initiate foundation work by mid July.   Between June 15 and July 15 they would do the foundation design - this should be on the generous side given that we had done some foundation design last fall, and with MCN at least have some of the N2 foundation work already done by ABB.Whether it's June 21 or 30 to start the site clearing, the schedule is getting tight.Re capital cost estimate:3.   NEPCO is able to complete the revised capital cost estimate on the N1/N2 case by June 9th at the latest (they're looking at moving it up to the 5th or 6th if they work the weekend).   They have a problem at the moment as they are moving offices over this weekend and will lose about 4 days.   They will have a revised estimate on the N1 case by the end of next week - it looks today like the cost savings for no acceleration and winter work and being able to barge the units versus railing them, will all be worth at least $2 MM US. I'm assuming we would take the capital costs estimate into our DASH as soon as the estimate is ready and go for approval, so that we can meet schedule - I'm not sure where you stand on the \"roll-up\" approval on Moore, Pastoria and Las Vegas if the latter two don't go into Genco.Meanwhile, progress through RAC on the DASH continues.Re N2 units:4.   We continue to sort out whether the Calumet units might work from a noise and water perspective.   We still haven't seen the MCN/Columbus counter on the other units but they claim it's coming.\n"

We continue to try to confirm the viability of the Peoples units.   We have not received NOx versus water injection data.   We still have not received the full noise spectrum data.   It looks like the only source for this is ABB and they're not fast.   Peoples and ourselves are going after ABB on these issues (and the possibility of a change order on the exciter design which doesn't meet Ontario specs). - we have confirmed that the municipality can provide 6000 USGPM of water, but the silica content has to be confirmed to see if it's a problem.   I met with Terra Industrial Tuesday and they remain interested in providing the treated water, but they would have to expand their treatment plant.   They can provide 1/3rd of the water required and their permit can handle the waste stream on regen for the full water flow - we're sorting out the optimum tank capacity versus treatment plant capacity sizing to meet reliability at minimum cost.   Bottom line is we've got options to handle this water flow and we can avoid trying to get a permit for waste water. - we're going to use the noise consultant EE&amp;CC used in conjunction with Agra Envir. in Canada to sort out the low frequency noise problem, and check the other frequencies against our nearest receptor, once we get the data from ABB. - Peoples are checking with ABB on the possibility of a change order on the exciter design.2. MCN/Columbus have come back on the other two N2 units - they want another $1 MM US and can't confirm any changes to the contract.We are completing our comparison of the Peoples/MCN contracts - the MCN contract is much better (guarantees, liquidated damages etc.) but of course power output is less.3. We kicked off Agra to prepare our permit amendment (using data from both the Peoples N2's and MCN N2's).4. NEPCO capital cost estimate will be ready June 9th.   It looks like $2-3 MM will come out of the base estimate for the N1's due to the acceleration and winter work coming out.   They still have to do the N2 estimate.   There might be a chance to push this ahead to the end of the 7th if we were to pressure them more.5. We feel we can increase our N1 output up by 6 MW at 90F without incremental O&amp;M.   The Peoples units would add an incremental 40 MW at 90F.Using the Peoples units our capital per kW at 90 F is $397 US/kW (using our original $156 MM incl. IDC estimate less $2 MM).Using the MCN units our capital per kW at 90F is $4443 US/kW.Issues:1. We are not getting great support from Houston in many areas, with the exception of some like Don Miller/Genco.   It appears that some groups like underwriting/RAC and structuring either are getting the message this project is not going ahead, or are taking our continued delays in approval to work on all of their other priorities (hoping that we will go away presumably...).   Schedule becomes more of a concern every day.2. The Ontario interconnection timing becomes more and more of a concern each day that passes as OH isn't the fastest working entity.   Aleck and Duncan continue to work the IMO/OHSC/OEB angles but with some of the rules not set yet we may need higher level pressure at some time soon.   I'll let you know.\n"

Until you tell me otherwise, we are going full steam ahead. Is there any way that you can help us get the airtime we need down south?

        " Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT on 06/02/2000 08:52 AM ---From: Eric LeDain on 06/01/2000 05:12 PMTo: Kyle Kitagawa/CAL/ECT@ECT, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Moore Power Plant statusThe following is a status update of key current items:1. We continue to try to confirm the viability of the Peoples units.   We have not received NOx versus water injection data.   We still have not received the full noise spectrum data.   It looks like the only source for this is ABB and they're not fast.   Peoples and ourselves are going after ABB on these issues (and the possibility of a change order on the exciter design which doesn't meet Ontario specs). - we have confirmed that the municipality can provide 6000 USGPM of water, but the silica content has to be confirmed to see if it's a problem.   I met with Terra Industrial Tuesday and they remain interested in providing the treated water, but they would have to expand their treatment plant.   They can provide 1/3rd of the water required and their permit can handle the waste stream on regen for the full water flow - we're sorting out the optimum tank capacity versus treatment plant capacity sizing to meet reliability at minimum cost.   Bottom line is we've got options to handle this water flow and we can avoid trying to get a permit for waste water. - we're going to use the noise consultant EE&amp;CC used in conjunction with Agra Envir. in Canada to sort out the low frequency noise problem, and check the other frequencies against our nearest receptor, once we get the data from ABB. - Peoples are checking with ABB on the possibility of a change order on the exciter design.2. MCN/Columbus have come back on the other two N2 units - they want another $1 MM US and can't confirm any changes to the contract.We are completing our comparison of the Peoples/MCN contracts - the MCN contract is much better (guarantees, liquidated damages etc.) but of course power output is less.3. We kicked off Agra to prepare our permit amendment (using data from both the Peoples N2's and MCN N2's).4. NEPCO capital cost estimate will be ready June 9th.   It looks like $2-3 MM will come out of the base estimate for the N1's due to the acceleration and winter work coming out.   They still have to do the N2 estimate.   There might be a chance to push this ahead to the end of the 7th if we were to pressure them more.5. We feel we can increase our N1 output up by 6 MW at 90F without incremental O&amp;M.   The Peoples units would add an incremental 40 MW at 90F.Using the Peoples units our capital per kW at 90 F is $397 US/kW (using our original $156 MM incl. IDC estimate less $2 MM).Using the MCN units our capital per kW at 90F is $4443 US/kW.Issues:1. We are not getting great support from Houston in many areas, with the exception of some like Don Miller/Genco.   It appears that some groups like underwriting/RAC and structuring either are getting the message this project is not going ahead, or are taking our continued delays in approval to work on all of their other priorities (hoping that we will go away presumably...).   Schedule becomes more of a concern every day.2. The Ontario interconnection timing becomes more and more of a concern each day that passes as OH isn't the fastest working entity.   Aleck and Duncan continue to work the IMO/OHSC/OEB angles but with some of the rules not set yet we may need higher level pressure at some time soon.   I'll let you know.\n"

You should also be doing any development work (permits, interconnection agreements et al) you need to do to maintain the optionality of this project (let me know if the expenses get above $1MM).Randy, please facilitate. Mike, can we put the screws to ABB given the significant transformer business we forwarded their way?Laura, we probably need to make a call on the Peoples turbine pretty soon.Eric/Rob, I think we need to see the project with IDC come in   between 350 to 4000/kw to be viable or I need a very detailed analysis of why it costs significantly more than a Frame 7 machine in the US markets.I would like see us make this work.RegardsDelainey---"

I joined Enron as a result of my interest in fuel cells as a business opportunity for me.   I met with Dave Ramm to discuss that opportunity and he asked me if I would be interested in working for Enron.   I recently read a press release that ENA had entered into an alliance with Fuel Cell Energy, Inc.   I still have a strong interest in fuel cells and the belief that they will be the most commonly used power supply of the not so distant future.   I went to a seminar on distributed power in Washington D.C. last week to talk with the technologists and hear what the investment community   thought about fuel cells and microturbines.   I learned a lot.Right now I am working for Enron Corp. Environmental, Health and Safety.   My job is interesting, but I have a stronger interest in fuel cells and the power technology that will serve DP.   Do you have a job opportunityfor a technologist in your business that is involved with fuel cells and microturbines?   If there is an opportunityI would like to talk with you about it.I graduated from Michigan Technological University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.   I have worked in manufacturing and the oil field service business.   I have worked at the corporate level in both businesses.I know what it takes to efficiently manufacture a product and how a business should be run.   I also understand the opportunities and liabilities that environmental protection poses to new industries and technologies.   I   knowthat I can help Enron in this area.If you would like my resume please let me know.Thank you for your consideration.Sincerely,David Ronkainen\n"

The numbers from ENA's side lay out as follows:ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs   $4,4449,000ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete $   720,000Reduction in Variable Overheads   $3,000,000IDC on ENA Overpayments   $   2000,000Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable   $   180,000Westinghouse L.D.'s- Gleason   $1,8000,000Westinghouse L.D.'s- Wheatland   $   5000,000Preliminary Total Reductionin Project Costs   $10,849,000ENA Payments vs. NEPCO Costs:   ENA paid according to pre-determined cash curves every month.   NEPCO's actual costs appear to be coming in about $4.5 MM less per the audit results that we both reviewed last Friday.ABB Breaker Costs/Estimate to Complete:   When we met last Friday, there were $1,459,000 of Open P.O.'s and other items that NEPCO still needed to investigate and closeout, you have a copy of the detailed schedule prepared by Amy Spoede.   Of the $1,459,000, there was $720,000 showing as still owing to ABB for Circuit Breakers at Wilton Center.   ABB has informed ENA that they have been payed in full for quite some time, thus I believe that this $720,000 is an accounting phantom that NEPCO needs to clear up.Reduction in Variable Overheads:   The $3,000,000 in variable overhead reduction is the number that you offered to cut this cost in our meeting last Friday.IDC on ENA Overpayments:   As part of our agreement with EE&amp;CC/NEPCO, ENA agreed to pay 2000 peaker construction costs based upon cash curves versus actual invoices.   The cash curves consistently overestimated NEPCO's actual disbursements, even after quarterly audits and true-ups.   NEPCO currently owes ENA over $2000,000 in IDC at the cost of capital charged by Enron Corp.Fixed Overhead Charged to Variable:   Some EE&amp;CC/NEPCO personnel coded time against variable overheads that should have been charged against the pre-agreed fixed overheads. Westinghouse L.D.'s:   ENA paid Westinghouse directly for the turbines.   ENA has held back $3.5 MM of retainage pending resolution of L.D.'s.   EE&amp;CC's/ENA's position is that Westinghouse owes $2.3 MM of L.D.'s ($1.8 MM @ Gleason, $0.5MM @ Wheatland).   The aforementioned L.D.'s are for delivery and schedule delays at Gleason and Wheatland.   There is an additional $1.0-1.6 MM of performance L.D.'s for missing heat rate guarantees at Gleason.   ENA will negotiate the performance L.D. settlement directly with Westinghouse because the cure will be getting additional MW's in trade against the L.D.'s.   Otherwise, Westinghouse can cure by minor unit modifications and re-test versus paying cash L.D.'s.   However, the Delivery and Schedule L.D.'s will still be negotiated by EE&amp;CC.Peaker Fee Settlement:   Based on our last meeting and additional research, I suggest the following path to quickly resolve the Peaker fee amount and payment.   If EE&amp;CC will take over the risk/reward of the Delivery &amp; Schedule L.D. issue with Westinghouse, then ENA will recharacterize the amounts detailed above as Peaker fee payment.   If EE&amp;CC is successful in keeping all the Schedule L.D.'s from Westinghouse, then it would have a $10.85 MM fee versus $9.2 MM.   EE&amp;CC only needs to keep $650,000 of the $2.3 MM of Westinghouse Schedule L.D.'s to have a $9.2 MM fee.Please let me know how you would like to proceed from here.Regards,Mike J Miller\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nMike, this appears to be a very reasonable settlement - proceed on this basis.   I assume this keeps my number in and around the $6000 to $615MM for the 2000's all in.RegardsDelainey---"

It is at 5205 Spruce (2 blocks north of Bellaire Blvd and 2 blocks west of Rice) in Bellaire.   It   is a great building for what you need for your cars.   It will lease for about $12-$15/sf annually (about 5000 sf including the garage space) and I have about $750,000 in the building.   If you have 1/3 of the building (+-$250,000) it will cost you about $1,6000/mo in interest.

I would encourage John Llodra and Jeff Ader to work closely together to create the best value proposition for Enron on the long term deal.Strict Confidentiality language is embedded in the 6-month NSTAR transaction, and it is extremely important that everyone involved honors the zero tolerance nature of this Confidentiality provision.   The bottom line is that we cannot disclose anything about this deal to any third partiies, including the mere existence of the deal.   If we do not respect this provision fully, we will jeapordize our goodwill with the customer and thus our ability to move forward with a longer term transaction.

The report concludes that the ISO must pursue a wide range of operational reforms and other consumer safeguards to \"ensure a more efficient and stable electric market that will better protect consumers from dramatic price increases.\" The report culminates a months-long investigation begun by the PSC last summer in response to problems and price run-ups in the wholesale market.The major recommendations in the Report, some of which have already surfaced in recent ISO Committee meetings, would be devastating to a competitive wholesale market and would largely reregulate prices in New York. They include the following (taken directly from the PSC's Press Release):Reforming rules and procedures to improve the efficiency of the market and minimize opportunities for market manipulation, or \"gaming,\" by owners of electricity generating facilities;Initiating a $150 per megawatt hour price cap on generators to maintain reasonable market clearing prices;Creating a \"circuit-breaker\" mechanism that will prevent market power abuses at levels below $150/MWH;Lowering price thresholds significantly to allow the NYISO to step in more quickly to investigate and mitigate price spikes;Granting the NYISO retroactive refund authority to return to consumers gains that generators improperly derive from market power abuse; and,Creating a strong deterrent against price abuses by penalizing generators who repeatedly use improper tactics to raise prices above competitive levels.The NYPSC, of course, has no legal authority to impose any of these recommendations. However, they are likely to muster support from the Transmission Owners, governmental entities and loads, that usually control enough votes to just   pass a motion at an ISO Committee. This will set up a confrontation with the ISO Board, which is walking a delicate tightrope between maintaining its independence and supporting a competitive wholesale market on the one hand, and dealing with the politics of a hostile Administration in New York. Last summer, as you may recall, the Board rejected the $1000 bid cap pushed through by the PSC, voting instead for a $13000 cap. That action was set aside by FERC, which reimposed the $1,000 level and then made it applicable in New England as well so that there would be consistency among the three Northeast ISOs (PJM already had the $1,000 cap.) Thus, whether NY follows the lead of California is likely to be determined by FERC, and it will have to carefully consider the consistency concerns it raised last summer in ultimately deciding whether it's OK for New York to set price caps below its neighboring ISOs.Attached is a copy of the PSC's Press Release and Report.http:///www.dps.state.ny.us/fileroom/doc8945.pdf\n"

Nella has been with Enron Canada for 61/2 years, including many of the formative years.   Nella has been an extraordinarily valuable asset to Enron Canada and she will be greatly missed.   Frankly, for all Nella has done for Enron Canada, and the dedication, commitment and sincerity with which she has done it, she cannot be replaced.   Nella has been instrumental in the development and ongoing maintenance and administration of our contracting forms, precedent systems, confirmation letters, contracting files, contract diarization and data base systems,   and has had significant input on the development and/or implementation of key corporate and managerial policies and controls.   More importantly, Nella always appreciated that, because of the nature of our business, our core assets are our contractual rights, and with much personal commitment, and often at much personal expense, Nella always endeavored to ensure that things not only got done, but that they got done properly and punctually.   I know that Linda, Greg, Mark and I (and many of you) will discover aspects of our jobs which we did not know existed because they were so capably and quietly looked after by Nella.Most importantly, Nella had great personal commitment to do all she could within the limits of available resources to help us achieve our personal objectives at Enron Canada, whether or not realistic.   Many of us, in many cases without even knowing it, could not have achieved many of our own individual accomplishments at Enron Canada without Nella's commitment and dedication.Nella will be missed, and I ask you to bear with us as we continue to try meet your requests until we are able to hire a suitable replacement.Regards, Peter.\n"

This would involve Origination only as Trading is doing an offsite in conjunction with the rest of Shankman's group.

Unfortunately, we have experienced a bit of a set-back re Ontario market opening. As you know, the market was scheduled to open November 1,2000. We had anticipated somewhat of a delay and had forecasted a Feb 1, 20001 start. This week the Minister of Energy announced that market opening would be delayed \"about 6 months\". This of course is very dissppointing to us and Aleck Dadson is working hard with the Ministry and other interested parties in shoring up a date with a tighter time frame.The reason for the delay is primarily due to the lack of readiness on behalf of the IMO. This is a frustrating situation for the minister and as such he has moved to appoint myself to the IMO Board. It should be noted that the Minister did not accept the IMO's board recommendation but unilaterally went with me. He was intent on appointing someone who had goal alignment re opening this market asap. This goes a long way in illustrating the great job our regulatory group (Aleck Dadson) has done/is doing   in positioning/developing credibility with the Ministry of Energy.   I know that you had concerns re time commitment but I believe strongly that Enron needs a voice at the IMO Board as this is a critical point in time to shape this marketplace.RegardsMilnthorp\n"

While comprehensive electricity reform legislation looks very dead, there are those that are pushing \"stand-alone\" legislation before Congress.   Attached is a letter that Enron will sign on to that opposes stand-alone PUHCA reform.   This bill is being pushed by Mid-American.Government Affairs continues to oppose all stand-alone legislation.   Basically our only real leverage is to keep PUHCA, PURPA, reliability, and wholesale access legislation linked in a comprehensive bill.   This may incent the holdouts to agree to our needs.If you need any additional information, please let me know.Thanks,Jim---",

Eric is located in the London office and also has responsibility for=\r=20\rleading the newly formed Pool Markets origination group reporting to Joe=20\rGold.   =20\r Rick Bergsieker has relocated to Dubai, in the UAE.

The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=\rt=20\rare underway to restructure   Enron=01,s operations in South America.   The b=\rasic=20\rorganizational framework has been set.=20\r As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=\r=20\rresponsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=\r=20\rJoe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=\r=20\rto Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.   They will share overall responsibility=\r;=20\rhowever, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20\rcommercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.   Joe=01,s focus =\rwill=20\rbe on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=\rl=20\rcountry management.   In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=\rO=20\rof Elektro until its ultimate sale.\r The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20\rElektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=\r=20\rEnron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=\r=20\rFrevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=\rnd=20\rArgentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=\r=20\rreputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20\rmanaged prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=\rs=20\rare pursued.\r The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20\rAmerica will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=\rrk=20\rbusiness model.   This model employs people, market making, physical=20\rcommodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=\re=20\rproducts to our customers.   It is people and intellectual capital based and=\r=20\renjoys high rates of return on invested capital.\r In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =\rto=20\rJoe and Orlando:\r=20\rThe Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.   The team will=\r =20\rfocus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=\r=20\rnatural gas and electricity, with the following goals:\r ? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=\r=20\rneeded by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20\rcapabilities;\r? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=\r=20\rvalue chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=\r=20\ropportunity;\r? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=\r=20\rquickly to capitalize;\r? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20\roverall risk of the organization;\r? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=\rca=20\rconsistent with this strategy, and\r? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=\ral=20\rflow.\r The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=\rho=20\rwork as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=\r=20\rcapital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=\rn,=20\rfinance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20\r The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.   The=\r=20\rteam will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=\r=20\rfor the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=\rs=20\refforts.   Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=\ry=20\rtrading South American energy commodities.   This group will be responsible=\r=20\rfor managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=\r=20\rreporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=\ras=20\rrisk activities.\r The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20\rCommercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=\r=20\rwill continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =\r=20\r The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=\ron=20\rthat is very market and commercially focused.   The following support=20\rfunctions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=\rm=20\rand will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20\rHouston.   The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20\runits have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=\r=20\rwell as manage day-to-day business and risk.   Otherwise, the Houston=20\rinfrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=\r=20\rin South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.\r These groups include:\r The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20\rmanage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=\r=20\rgovernmental ministries.   The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=\r,=20\rin the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20\rfunctioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20\rassume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.   During th=\ris=20\rinterim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=\ry=20\rfunction.   Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20\rShapiro in Enron Government Affairs.\r The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.   The team will manage t=\rhe=20\rinterface with Enron Global Finance.   Britaldo will transition from his=20\rcurrent duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.   Britaldo wi=\rll=20\ralso report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.   Rob Gay will be=20\rassisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=\r=20\rCuiaba project.\r The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=\r=20\rJohn Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=\r=20\rrequirements.   Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20\rWholesale Services - Legal Department.\r Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.   Human Resources, Information=20\rTechnology, Treasury, Accounting &amp; Reporting, as well as Administration wil=\rl=20\rreport to Miguel.   This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=\r=20\rfunctions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20\rrelationships with Enron.   Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=\r=20\rWholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=\r=20\rServices =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.\r These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20\rreflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20\rfinancial and intellectual capital.   However, in line with the new=20\rorganizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20\rregion, further budget reductions will be necessary.   People directly=20\raffected will be notified shortly.\r=20\rEnron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20\rbusinesses in South America.   We believe that as the markets develop, we ar=\re=20\runiquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20\rshareholder value.=20\r\n"

ASAP--- South America is going home &amp; they are off tomorrow ---Thank=\rs,=20\rkay\r   On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=\rn,=20\rannouncing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20\roperations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=\rt=20\rare underway to restructure   Enron=01,s operations in South America.   The b=\rasic=20\rorganizational framework has been set.=20\r As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=\r=20\rresponsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=\r=20\rJoe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=\r=20\rto Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.   They will share overall responsibility=\r;=20\rhowever, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20\rcommercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.   Joe=01,s focus =\rwill=20\rbe on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=\rl=20\rcountry management.   In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=\rO=20\rof Elektro until its ultimate sale.\r The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20\rElektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=\r=20\rEnron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=\r=20\rFrevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=\rnd=20\rArgentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=\r=20\rreputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20\rmanaged prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=\rs=20\rare pursued.\r The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20\rAmerica will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=\rrk=20\rbusiness model.   This model employs people, market making, physical=20\rcommodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=\re=20\rproducts to our customers.   It is people and intellectual capital based and=\r=20\renjoys high rates of return on invested capital.\r In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =\rto=20\rJoe and Orlando:\r=20\rThe Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.   The team will=\r =20\rfocus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=\r=20\rnatural gas and electricity, with the following goals:\r ? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=\r=20\rneeded by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20\rcapabilities;\r? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=\r=20\rvalue chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=\r=20\ropportunity;\r? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=\r=20\rquickly to capitalize;\r? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20\roverall risk of the organization;\r? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=\rca=20\rconsistent with this strategy, and\r? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=\ral=20\rflow.\r The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=\rho=20\rwork as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=\r=20\rcapital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=\rn,=20\rfinance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20\r The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.   The=\r=20\rteam will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=\r=20\rfor the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=\rs=20\refforts.   Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=\ry=20\rtrading South American energy commodities.   This group will be responsible=\r=20\rfor managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=\r=20\rreporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=\ras=20\rrisk activities.\r The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20\rCommercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=\r=20\rwill continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =\r=20\r The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=\ron=20\rthat is very market and commercially focused.   The following support=20\rfunctions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=\rm=20\rand will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20\rHouston.   The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20\runits have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=\r=20\rwell as manage day-to-day business and risk.   Otherwise, the Houston=20\rinfrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=\r=20\rin South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.\r These groups include:\r The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20\rmanage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=\r=20\rgovernmental ministries.   The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=\r,=20\rin the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20\rfunctioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20\rassume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.   During th=\ris=20\rinterim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=\ry=20\rfunction.   Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20\rShapiro in Enron Government Affairs.\r The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.   The team will manage t=\rhe=20\rinterface with Enron Global Finance.   Britaldo will transition from his=20\rcurrent duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.   Britaldo wi=\rll=20\ralso report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.   Rob Gay will be=20\rassisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=\r=20\rCuiaba project.\r The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=\r=20\rJohn Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=\r=20\rrequirements.   Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20\rWholesale Services - Legal Department.\r Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.   Human Resources, Information=20\rTechnology, Treasury, Accounting &amp; Reporting, as well as Administration wil=\rl=20\rreport to Miguel.   This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=\r=20\rfunctions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20\rrelationships with Enron.   Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=\r=20\rWholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=\r=20\rServices =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.\r These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20\rreflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20\rfinancial and intellectual capital.   However, in line with the new=20\rorganizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20\rregion, further budget reductions will be necessary.   People directly=20\raffected will be notified shortly.\r=20\rEnron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20\rbusinesses in South America.   We believe that as the markets develop, we ar=\re=20\runiquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20\rshareholder value.=20\r \n"

Due to promotions and additions to the Associate and Analyst Programs, we have an additional slot for the Analyst PRC that we would like to fill with an ENA participant.   This will keep the distribution throughout the business units equitable.   I understand from Charlene that you have asked Janet Dietrich to nominate the PRC Rep.We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.   Please forward your choice for ENA representation to me by this date or contact me to discuss.Also, I know that there have been discussions between Terry Bosien, David Oxley, Andrea Yowman and others to schedule ENA's pre-rating meeting prior to the final A/A PRC which has been scheduled for December 12th and 13th.   We must have the pre-ratings loaded into the PEP system prior to these dates and hope they can be final by November 30th.   These results are imperative to a successful cross-calibration in the final PRC meeting.   We already have dates set for the EES and ESA meetings.   I will be glad to attend the Associate and Analyst piece of ENA's PRC meetings to assist in facilitation.   Please advise when the ENA pre-rating meeting is scheduled.   Thank you for your cooperation.\n"

This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air permit).   The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach given his understanding of the project risks and economics.   The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -&lt; Turbo Park   with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 20001.   there is likely a need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 through Jan 31.We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, fuel).   In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).   We will have a definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.   I spoke   with Jacoby and   Janet and told them we are planning to take the remaining two LM6000's for this project.I am available to talk about it at your convenience.Regards,Chris---",
        " Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT on 10/09/2000 09:56 AM ---Christopher F Calger10/08/2000 05:13 PMTo: Chip Schneider/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Stephen Thome/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff G Slaughter/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: PSCOChip,PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 6-LM6000 project with a June 20001 start date.   The additional two LM6000's materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&amp;m decrease.   We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional equipment through West LB ASAP:6 stacks   $1,1888,0003 Control Modules $375,0001 CEMS   $675,0004 230kv Breakers $340,000Total:   $2,578,000The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.   More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are minimal as follows:Now through November 1:   $257,8000Now through November 30:   $340,000 (additional $83,000)Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:EE&amp;CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:   $175,000EE&amp;CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:   $75,000EE&amp;CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $7000,000Based on the above, I will exceed $5000K around October 18.   Given our Board approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount might be $1.5MM which allows for equipment cancellation and engineering costs.   That would allow us to move forward aggressively and prepare a more complete final project approval for the next regularly scheduled Board / Exec Committe meeting in November.How does this sound to you?Regards,Chris\n"

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 07/06/2000 07:41 PM ---Mike J Miller07/06/2000 04:29 PMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Peaker FeeEE&amp;CC has forwarded the peaker fee ($9.1 MM) invoice to ENA (see at bottom).   I have sent a return e-mail to Gavin Gaul and John Normand explaining that final approval of this invoice will be from you.   Amy and I are waiting for a better breakdown of overhead charges on acceleration change orders.   Once we have the overhead issue framed out, I would then battle the fee, especially on Wilton Center, on a packaged basis with the overhead charges.As per the Wilton Center fee, I reviewed all of the e-mail rhetoric regarding who is to blame for the massive construction cost overruns.   EECC/NEPCO's cupbability lies in their insistance from day one that Wilton Center could and would be built non-union.   It was only after ENA forced the decision in late June 1999 to build the job union (to avoid air permit intervention) that EECC/NEPCO even began to deal with how to build the job in a union environment.   Even at that point, EECC/NEPCO would not move off of building the job on a cost reimbursable basis and did not properly consider other alternatives such as fixed unit pricing (fixed price per unit quantity installed).   EECC/NEPCO claimed that they did not have enough time to negotiate with the unionsor pursue other options.   However, because of their insistance to go non-union, they precluded the ability to negotiate until the decision to go union was made.   According to our labor experts, breaking off union site negotiations and building non-union is worse than just going non-union from the start.   In any event, if you need more detail on this subject prior to discussing the fee with Larry Izzo, please let me know and I will summarize the key points.I will continue to work with Amy Spoede to tie down the remaining cost and overhead issues.

Discussion with GE at sufficiently high level to determine whether any GE units at any sites have ever made &lt;9 ppm NOx with CO &lt;25 ppm (M. Dobler has initiated this discussion with Michelle April of GE).2.   A detailed plan of attack from GE to get the units within guarantee emission limits.3.   Resolution of the HMI sluggish response issue complete with a plan of attack.   The units can be run, but are clearly not ready for commercial operation with the sluggish HMI.Wheatland:1.   A plan of attack from Westinghouse to correct the fuel valves (and/or nozzles) on units 1 and 2.   Currently, the units can not be run reliably at base load.2.   Plan of attack and schedule to correct the vibrations on 1 &amp; 2.3.   A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls support (this comment also applies to Gleason); sharing Rutledge and PCD controls personnel is proving inadequate.4.   Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to get answers.   A dedicated EE&amp;CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office would help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Gleason also).Gleason:1.   A detailed schedule and plan of attack is needed for the compressor blade modifications on units 1&amp;2.2.   An on-site EE&amp;CC representative is required to bird-dog the compressor blade seals modification.3.   Verification from Westinghouse that the 12 day modification will not slip into 3 weeks is required (see item 1).4.   Verification that the IGV's have been fully corrected is required.5.   A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls support (this comment also applies to Wheatland); sharing Rutledge and PCD controls personnel is proving inadequate.6.

I was wondering if you could help me find new generation work within your company.   If you are not in the market for additional capacity I would appreciate your comments on how I might proceed.We primarily install, relocate or otherwise put power in service on a turnkey basis, virtually anywhere in the world.   We also do major repairs, mechanical and electrical, rotating equipment and even substation equipment.   We have a rather strange assortment of equipment to support our work, special hydra lift trailers for moving large engine without disassembly, cranes for use in trying areas, high voltage bucket trucks, a portable repair shop that can be moved to a major site that is 1000 ft X 60 ft and is fully equipped for anything from turbine repairs, installs or we can do a large rewind ...For off-shore work we have a floating shop, a service vessel that has equipment on-board to move generation or also do similar service and repairs.   An example might be a turbine or other generation installation even on a barge power plant that is in service ... we can often dock along side and do it all as though the barge was in a harbor.Sometimes, in addition to supplying New Equipment, we can supply used, refurbished or surplus assets.   Several possible powerplants considered for relocation are made available by Marcor Remediation Inc.   Marcor is working with the Jacksonville Electric Authority, Basin Electric and other major US utilities to offer certain Surplus Generating Assets to the worlds energy sectors.   This equipment is listed in some detail on our company webpage(http:///www.marcor.com/services/sales/sales.htm.)   This is a partial listing so let me know if your company contacts are in the market for anything in particular, we may be able to help.These are additional properties I am working on, we handle Turnkey installations all over the world as well as a good deal of offshore work.   Currently, we can deliver an LM 6000, up and running in less than 90 days.BARGE MOUNTED POWER PLANT, 1000+ MEGAWATTWe can provide a 1000+   MW Barge Mounted Power Plant, complete, ABS Certified, consisting of two (2) 50 MW Gas Turbine Generators.Outputs are at ISO conditions.   These units will be refurbished and ready to operate on either Natural Gas or Fuel Oil and installed on an ABS certified barge.   Delivery can occur within approximately 120 working days (4 months) after receipt of funds as specified below.The two Gas Turbines will be set up to operate singularly or in parallel.The Generator output will be 10,8000 volts, 3-phase, 50 HZ.   (With upgrade to 60 HZ available)   The power will be transported to shore by overhead transmission lines at Generator voltage.   A control room will be provided together with switchgear and circuit disconnects.The customer/buyer will be responsible for providing all fuel needs including delivery and storage of fuel.   The customer will also be responsible for all Grid connections and transformation of power.We will provide, as part of the Barge package, an emergency generator for lighting and Barge pumps.   The Turbines can be started with electric motors powered from the emergency generator (diesel fueled) or by pressurized air.All of this equipment is offered subject to prior sale.   The costs will be adjusted accordingly if additional or substitute equipment is required by customer.The two (2) Gas Turbines can be adapted to operate on Heavy Fuel (HFO) or Bunker \"C\" or #6 Fuel oil, providing proper oil treatment modules are utilized.   We will offer this equipment under separate Contract.ESTIMATE OF COSTS:1000 + MW Power Barge can be furnished as described for approx. $3000.000 USD/ kW or $ 30,000,000.000.Any commissions, \"finders fees\", or other unidentified costs, shall be added to the cost shown here.   At this price, USED equipment is utilized.To prepare a formal quotation and provide detailed equipment specifics, i.e. model numbers, serial numbers, etc., a one-percent (1%) Cash Advance shall be placed in an escrow account with draws for the preparation of same and expenses incurred.   An Executed \"Non-Disclosure, Non-Compete, Non-Circumvent Agreement\" must be signed by the \"end-user\".   It will take two (2) weeks, after receipt of one-percent (1%) cash advance funds, and after ALL pertinent information regarding the ultimate construction of the barge is received by us from the buyer, to prepare the Formal Quotation.After receipt of the Formal Quotation/Proposal,   buyer shall have two (2) weeks to place a five-percent (5%) refundable deposit which will allow him thirty (30) days to perform \"due diligence\".   At the end of this \"due diligence\" period, buyer shall pay eighty-five percent (85%) of the total purchase price.   The balance due shall be paid upon customer acceptance of the unit.Currently, we have a \"window\" of opportunity open to immediately initiate necessary engineering work.   This work will be accomplished by \"World Class\" Maritime Contractors; therefore, meeting the highest of Standards.NEW 1999 MODEL POWER BARGEWe can furnish 1000MW Power Barge complete with two (2) new, state- of- the-art 1999 model, Westinghouse Turbine Gensets, 50 Hz, for approximately $ 420.000/kW.

Don't imagine you are too upset not having to deal with California or the wildfires out west?   Things are going well for us here, but as we expected it is like the US in 94/95 (things just starting) and Europe (96/97).   The Japanese utilities are not being too original in their approach... same playbook.   Regardless of all of this, looking at sites and potential development of physical trading assets is starting to look quite promising.   Jpnese cutting back on nuclear and significantly increasing LNG and many old oil-fired plants out there are just a few of the characteristics.You mentioned in your last email that you had significantly reduced your efforts at adding capacity in the East.   Along these lines would you know of anyone that might be interested in a Japan tour to get all of this going?   Ideally it would be someone at the Director level.   Let me know.Joe\n"

I spoke with Smutney this evening.   He likes the idea of Enron taking the lead with McNally/Temple.   I've emailed him the one-pager we worked up today.---Palmer, Steffes, Dasovich,ParquetThe urgency for a solution is growing and a vaccuum has formed, with many trying to fill the void.   The Cal. Manufacturers Ass. has called a meeting with IEP and the utilities.   Dave Parquet and Doug Condon will attend.I spoke with the VP of Strategic Planning at the ISO today who said there is a \"98% chance\" that price caps will be on the agenda at the August ISO Board meeting.Dave Parquet continues to check with SDG&amp;E to determine when SDG&amp;E plans to make an announcement about what it intends to do with the offers it received last week.Dave Parquet is working with Andy Kellerman and J. Steffes to try and get the investment community energized on this issue.The issue is now apparently affecting California legislative races.   Staffers are drafting a bill that an \"at risk\" Democrat Senator from San Diego will carry, with the hope of using the bill to get the bump necessary to win the election.   Mona will meet with the staffer on Thursday to find out what he has in mind for the bill and to communicate our views.Dasovich will meet with Commissioner Bilas Wednesday to see if the Republican block of the California PUC is hanging tough.That's it from our end.Best,Jeff\n"

The items and the expected completion dates are outlined below:Closing Item   Expected Completion Date Status1. Execution of LOU   August 4   Several issues remain to be negotiated.   I do not anticipate any problem in reaching mutual agreement on the issues.   Border meets with their audit committee on August 2 and hopes to sign August 3.   Will be in the position to review with you and Dave on August 1 or 2.2. Employment Issues   August 14   Offers of employment/transfer are in the process of being designed and prepared. Primary   issues include a) identification and handling of ENA end-of-year bonus compensation (Shiela   Knudson is coordinating this and I feel this issue is being adequately addressed).   b) potential disparity between GPG and ENA incentive compensation plans. I am working with Bill   Cordes and Ann Vaughn w/ GPG on developing a plan that will address this issue.   Based on the   conference call with Bill and Ann this morning, I am optimistic that this issue will be properly   addressed.   The plan is to have employment issues identified in a letter and presented to   employees on August 7th.3. Reserve Consultants   August 111   Kicked off consultants in a meeting in Omaha on July 26th. We are providing information and   assisting in the process.4. Due Diligence   August 25   A detailed schedule of all due diligence activity is being updated by Northern Border and I will   forward that schedule to you once I receive the update.5. Hart, Scott Rodino   September 8-15   There is a high probability that a Hart, Scott, Rodino filing will have to be made upon execution of   the LOU. There is a 30 day review period.   This may be the critical path item.6. Drafting/Negotiating PSA September 8-15   Shonnie Daniel is coordinating the drafting of the Purchase and Sale Agreement. It is expected   that this agreement will be agreed upon in early to mid September.One key date you should be aware of is Northern Border is anticipating making a press release after the LOU is executed (release date is expected to be August 7).   They will be coordinating press release issues with Eric Thode.I feel confident that this transaction will be closed in September. If you have any questions, please let me know. \n"

Property insurance rates are generally rising for everyone and particularly those with poor loss experience. Unfortunately, Enron falls in the latter category. In the past, not withstanding our loss experience, Enron has enjoyed very competitive rates and a deductible of $5000,000 for both property damage and business interruption (traditionally, property insurance policies contain a monetary deductible for property damage plus a day waiting period for business interruption (normally 30 to 90 days))).   For the period 19993 through 2000 Enron paid premiums of approximately $1114,1000,000 and collected losses of approximately $ 212,2000.000.   This trend is continuing under the current policy which is expiring on 3/1/20001. Current renewal terms being offered require an estimated premium of   $17,000,000 and a deductible of $5,000,000 per loss for property damage and business interruption. This is the lowest deductible achievable unless we are willing to accept a waiting period for business interruption. Realising the potential costs and budgetary and contractual implications associated with such a change, we are continuing negotiations and seeking alternatives to the current renewal terms. However, we should all be prepared for an increase in premiums and the level of loss which we retain through deductibles. I will keep you advised as these negotiations progress. Please forward this notice to all concerned parties within your group. If there are any questions, please give me a call at ext. 36263.\n"

Note:   There were no interventions or protests in this docket and FERC issued a letter order accepting the filing on Nov. 2.

I will try to call you later today, butwill send this note just in case I miss you.While I am interested in following up with Tim about our project in the NW,there are two other more pressing reasons for talking with the right guys atEnron. First, we have just secured the rights to a 16000 MW plant in Texas -permitting complete and just about ready for financing. We are also close tosecuring the rights to a 8000 MW project in Oklahoma. So we would like totalk about tolling, etc. for both of those plants.Also, word on the street is that Enron is not only selling existinggenerating stations, but also its projects under development. I think I sawa report that your CEO denied this. But, if there is any truth in thestatement, we would like to follow up, especially concerning the developmentsites. It may be possible for us to take over development and have a tieback to Enron for the marketing (and perhaps the operations) of the project.Hope you are enjoying London,Cheers,Chuck---Original Message---From: George.McClellan@enron.com [mailto:George.McClellan@enron.com]Sent: Tuesday, September 12, 2000 1:32 AMTo: cjbrown3@usa.netCc: Tim.Belden@enron.comSubject: West Power guyChas - I left a message on your voice mail regarding Tim Belden, who headsup our west power desk.

By the way the pitch to Colonial pipeline went okay yesterday.   Good news - Bill Scott CEO said we were the only company that could deliver exactly what he asked for.   Bad news is that he thought it should be 25% lower.   I believe his reaction is simply a gut reaction from a former trader and we are following up with information to get him better educated as to why this is a good deal for him.   We have $20 - $30mm in the deal and this creates roughly $70mm of value or savings (depending on your assumptions) for Colonial.   I believe we can get to a trade with them.

We will clarify what RAC views as the current valuation of Basic as well as RAC's recommendation with respect to this divestiture and modify the DASH as quickly as possible.Your comments prompted a question with regard to ENA's divestiture strategy.   Is it correct to assume that if we use a typical market liquidity premium of 30% (i.e., future divestiture proceeds are 70% of the expected terminal value at the divestiture date to account for potential changes in future market conditions) in a sale deferral scenario and this deferral results in a higher NPV at the RAC capital price than the proposed sale proceeds, ENA would elect to retain the asset?   Or should a higher than \"market\" capital price be assigned by RAC to these assets earmarked for divestiture?Regards,Dave\n"

It will be difficult to come up with a mathematic decision rule to manage this process.   I am looking to the opinions of yourself, Ray, Dick and Jeff, given the facts in each case, does this appear to be a good trade given the market, the specifics of the company, the carrying costs of the asset and perhaps our desire to increase capital flow to higher return assets (ROCE &lt;25%).This is clearly not a fire sale and I trust the opinion or consensus that comes from this group.   As a result, I need to have a positve consensus from this group in each case.RegardsDelainey---"

Building another theoretical model in the Basic situation seems naive to me.   This company is and has been in a financial death spiral.   For months, all involved on the ENA side have been focused on a probability that the Basic situation would result in a writeoff of a very significant piece of the Merlin debt and nothing for the equity.   The deal we are working on is at the high end of the projections reviewed with the rating agencies on recovery for the Merlin debt and actually gets us at least some chance of recovery on our equity.I do not agree that no effort has been made to market the company.   As you recall, we worked very intensively in trying to support an IPO which would take out the debt.   Despite many attempts to structure a successful offering (and a series of difficult concessions by Enron), the IB finally pulled it.   The S-1, by the way, was about the ugliest I have ever seen.We carefully evaluated seeking an industry purchaser.   Our conclusion was that this risked losing significant value, would require a good deal of time, and had virtually no likelihood of equalling the recovery we have would achieve if we can do the deal on the table.   This evaluation was reinforced with the contacts we have had with industry players.In any liquidation there is always the possibility that another path could possibility capture more value.   In this case especially, I think we have a very good idea of reality and are making an uniformed decision to recommend a better-than-exected exit.   This is not a firesale.We will continue to work constructively with RAC in a non-confrontational mode on Basic.   Be assured, however, that if I feel there is a real risk of process getting in the way of achieving our objectives, I will raise a red flag.

I think we should pick up the 7EA's and maybe the 501D's as well (doubt we could pick and choose). I met with Mark Frevert yesterday afternoon to discuss the East Generation Strategy (along with Ben Jacoby and Don Miller) and he wanted me to talk with Larry Izzo about us taking all 4 turbines. Should I go ahead and have that discussion or would you like to discuss this in more detail first? The LM6000 position looks like this:24 turbines allocated:4 City of Austin4 Enron South America4 Las Vegas Cogen6 Public Service of Colorado6 Florida Merchant plantHeather Kroll and Ozzie Pagan are bringing their VEPCO/North Carolina deal to a point where we will probably need to make a decision in the next 2-3 weeks. It has a 4-year PPA and we are basically obligated to build a power plant to back-fill the position. The PPA will be able to be served from the market or plant, and we would need to use 4 of the 6 dual-fuel LM's currently allocated to Florida. There is a possibility we could go back to the 501D's but we'll have to see. The ecomomics of the deal leave Enron with about a 40-45% residual value on the plant at the end of 4 years, and Bruce Sukaly is in the process of showing this entire project to 4 counterparties in order to monetize the entire position.We still have 2-3 other customers looking at the LM's although they are moving fairly slow.I'd like to discuss our development strategy in a little more detail with you when you return but here are the highlights: Ben and his team will be looking to increase the sites we have under our control in several regions: PJM, ECAR, Georgia, and Florida to name a few. I think we may want to consider some configurations that include combined-cycle options that have a 5-year term (vs. our standard 2-year currently), primarily in Florida and maybe Georgia. Ben is putting this on paper along with the incremental resource needs and incremental developmental dollars needed. I think we should talk about increasing our site bank/development portfolio in Canada as well.   Let me know your thoughts! Thanks. \n"

RAC, however, is close to finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings---both prepaids and tilted swaps---that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.   For example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AA counterparty with standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated approval document.   This abbreviated approval document would only be available for transactions meeting these criteria if:   (i) structured financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (ii) the pricing met a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is impractical or inefficient.   It is presently contemplated that the abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:   the Originator's and   a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.   In any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA.Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.Regards,Dave David W Delainey111/02/2000 09:25 AMTo: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joseph Deffner/HOU/ECT@ECT, John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Commodity / Embedded Finance DealsTim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals.Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.   David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues.

As I had mentioned, this is a competitive process and time is of the essence.   If we get resolution to these points, I would be prepared to sit down over a finite period of time (three or four days) to try and hammer out the transaction.Specifically:AEP Point #2: ENA would accept a triggering event and MAC clause for the lease.   This would under certain conditions allow AEP to purchase the leased assets at the present value of the future lease payments plus the fair value in year thirty of the underlying assets at an agreed upon discount rate.   The triggering events would include bankruptcy, insolvency or Enron Corp falling below investment grade.   An Enron Corp guarantee would be offered to secure that covenant.   We would similarly ask for similar credit language in the lease agreement, with an AEP parental guarantee, securing the lease obligation from AEP.   These paragraphs would be constructed in a similar manner to triggering events and MAC clauses in master commodity documents.ENA would also acknowledge that it would not sell the lease or physical assets underlying the lease to any other party but AEP.   I would anticipate that this would be managed through a ROFR structure.   This would ensure that AEP would have access to the assets if sold and that AEP can feel confortable that they will be dealing with Enron for the period of the lease.Notwithstanding above, Enron needs the flexibility to pledge or sell the AEP lease stream in order to monetize your obligation to cash if desired.   This makes the set-off language difficult.   With the triggering event and MAC clause, the need for set-off to protect AEP in the event of Enron default should not be required.AEP Point #5:   ENA would agree to a three month non-compete which prohibits ENA from soliciting business with the suppliers or producers connected to the Pipeline.   This non-compete would apply to transactions over one month in duration. This would apply to ENA only and no other Enron Corp affiliates.AEP Point #6:   I believe that ENA has already agreed in principal to your request under this point.AEP Point #1:   ENA would require indemnity limitation, including representation and warranties and basic construction, similar to our last draft language previously provided to you.   Would also request a two year window rather than three on environmental claims.AEP Point #3:   ENA would counter with a $40 million break up fee if AEP does not get requisite SEC approval by April 1, 20001.AEP Point #4:   On HSR and FERC approvals, AEP's position as layed out in the letter is not practical since it would be very difficult to pull out certain pieces of the pipe from the deal and ensure that both parties get the benefit of the bargain.   If AEP is unwilling to give an asset divestment covenant and given AEP's limited gas infrastructure position,   ENA's position is that AEP should take the risk that they will be able to get the approvals.   Other:   ENA will not agree as a condition to this transaction a settlement of any FERC issues between AEP and EPMI; however, ENA would always be willing to discuss such items in a different forum.If you have any questions or comments do not hesitate to contact myself or Tim Detmering.

Key person.Joao Carlos A. - although he is working on the project on an ad hoc basis he is key in terms of the FURNAS/Eletrobras relationship.   Not only does he know folks but he also gets things done within the system.Valeria Lema - She is the relationship manager with ANP.Daiane Duarte - Daiane Duarte is on the PanEng payroll until the end of the year after which she has been dialed out.   Have asked Rick several times about her future with his group.   She is critical locally in Cuiaba due to relations with FEMA and other agencies for obtaining the state permits that are still outstanding as well as working with Anson et al.Lucio Reis - he is very active in working with ANEEL/ONS/MAE and others.   He has been a key to our success on the CC account.   He is a must to making the project successful.   Knows the contacts and basically understands the project from the regulatory and CC account point-of-view.Two other people that are not involved in \"our side\" of fence on a daily basis but are valuable are Jose Bestard and John Novak.   Jose knows the history and John is the counsel with the longest tenure on the project.PeteJoe Kishkill111/27/2000 06:16 AMTo: Peter E Weidler/NA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: Re: Cuiaba Review   Pete,But you (or does anyone) have a definitive team list for Cuiaba?   Need this for transition planning purposes.   I agree with your sentiment that some folks may be pulling double duty while we button up Cuiaba.

Her current thinking is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight forward   decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.   I am thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.   In attendance are Rob and John.   Can divide the presentation up into - getting the construction finished/cost issues/EEECC - subcontractor issues. - Laine Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - RickMAE/ONS issues - current thinking.   - JoseCurrent economics. - RickEveryone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we send the page per topic around by this friday.   I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.Pete\n"

Tracey\r Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20\r2000.   Some of the more notable accomplishments include:\ra) 1000% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;\rb) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=\rhe=20\r(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20\rgenerating assets, (ii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;\rc) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;\rd) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;\re) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;\rf) 5000% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=\re=20\rto the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and\rg) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.\r These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=\r=20\rand opportunity in Enron North America for 20001 are consistent with that=20\rsuccess.   In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=\r=20\rnumber of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.   The=\r=20\rgoals of such re-alignment include:\ra) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=\re=20\ris in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;\rb) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=\r=20\rwith the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=\r=20\rflow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=\r=20\rour trading organization;\rc) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=\r=20\rour resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=\r=20\rour =01&amp;mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;\rd) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=\rnd=20\rorigination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20\ralign those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;\re) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=\r=20\rwith our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and\rf) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=\re=20\rcritical to meeting our goals next year.\r With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=\rls=20\rin Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20\rbeing implemented:\ra) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=\ret=20\rand origination will be formed under the co-leadership of Kevin Presto and=\r=20\rJanet Dietrich who will report to the Enron Americas - Office of the Chairm=\ran=20\r(EA OOC).   This team will have one income statement, one book and a joint=\r=20\raccountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=\rse=20\rteams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=\r=20\rthe risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20\rpartnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=\rte=20\rorigination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=\r=20\rprovide information and generate strategic positions.   Overall, the team wi=\rll=20\rbe rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20\rcoverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20\rEastern power markets. The team will be responsible for covering the IOU=01=\r,s,=20\rmuni=01,s/co-ops, industrials and IPP=01,s and will utilize all ENA=01,s pr=\roduct=20\rcapabilities including the power commodity, assets and capital. The team wi=\rll=20\rfurther be broken down into several key strategic regions and business unit=\rs=20\rincluding:=20\r   (i) ERCOT =01) managed by Doug Gilbert Smith and Bruce Sukaly;\r   (ii) NE =01) managed by Dana Davis and Jeff Ader;\r   (ii) Midwest =01) managed by Fletch Sturm and Ed Baughman;\r   (iv) SE =01) managed by Rogers Herndon and Ozzie Pagan;\r   (v) East Power Development =01) managed by Ben Jacoby;\r   (vi) East Power Structuring   - managed by Bernie Aucoin; and\r   (vii) East Power Fundamentals and the =01&amp;Genco=018 =01) managed by Lloyd=\r Will\r   =20\rb) West Power =01) there will be no changes to the Portland office which is=\r=20\rmanaged by Tim Belden and Chris Calger .   Both Tim and Chris will continue =\rto=20\rreport to the EA OOC.\rc) Canada and Mexico =01) there will be no changes to the Canadian or Mexic=\ran=20\roffices which are managed by Rob Milnthorp and Max Yzaguirre respectively. =\r=20\rBoth Rob and Max will continue to report to the EA OOC.\rd) U.S. Natural Gas =01) there are several changes anticipated in this busi=\rness=20\rconsistent with the goals and objectives described above. The changes=20\rprimarily affect the East, Central, West and Texas gas regions. Each region=\r=20\rwill consist of a single gas team incorporating trading, mid-market and=20\rorigination. Each team will have one income statement, one book and a joint=\r=20\raccountability. However, a clear delineation of responsibilities inside the=\rse=20\rteams will continue to exist in which the trading organization will manage=\r=20\rthe risk, income statement and product development aspects of the=20\rpartnership. The originators will have the primary responsibility to genera=\rte=20\rorigination income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead strategy formulation,=\r=20\rprovide information and generate strategic positions. Overall, the team wil=\rl=20\rbe rewarded based upon increasing the value of the book, meeting=20\rcoverage/deal flow targets and meeting its strategic/growth goals in the=20\rEastern, Western, Central and Texas gas markets.   The team will be=20\rresponsible for covering the LDC=01,s, muni=01,s/co-ops, industrials, IOU=\r=01,s, IPP=01,s=20\rand the producers.   There will be an increasing focus on the upstream side =\rof=20\rthe business including the producers, transporters and storage providers in=\r=20\raddition to market area opportunities. The team will utilize all of ENA=01,=\rs=20\rproduct capabilities including the gas commodity, assets and capital. Each =\rof=20\rthese groups will report directly to the EA OOC;\rEast Gas =01) a single East Gas Team incorporating trading, mid-market and=\r=20\rorigination will be formed under the co-leadership of Scott Neal and Frank=\r=20\rVickers who will be returning from Portland to join this team. =20\rWest Gas   =01) in a similar manner, a West Gas Team will be formed co-manag=\red by=20\rPhillip Allen and Barry Tycholiz, who will be joining us in Houston from th=\re=20\rCanadian team. The Denver office under Mark Whitt will be integrated under=\r=20\rthis team.\rCentral Gas =01)   in a similar manner, a Central Gas Team will be formed=20\rco-managed by Hunter Shively and Laura Luce. The Chicago office will be=20\rintegrated into this team.\rTexas Gas =01) the Texas Gas Team will be managed by Tom Martin. This team =\rwill=20\rcontinue to manage the gas trading business around HPL until the pending sa=\rle=20\ris concluded in Q2 20001.   After the sale of HPL, this team will build a Tex=\ras=20\rgas business without ownership of the HPL assets. =20\rFinancial =01) this group will continue to be managed by John Arnold with n=\ro=20\rsignificant changes.\rDerivatives =01) this group, lead by Fred Lagrasta, will offer derivative a=\rnd=20\rfinancial mid-market products and services to the natural gas market=20\rspecifically targeting CFO=01,s and treasury departments.   Fred will contin=\rue to=20\rmaintain certain existing mid-market accounts with a number of producer and=\r=20\rindustrial accounts where relationships are well formed. Otherwise,=20\rmid-market coverage will gravitate to the regions. The New York office gas=\r=20\rmarketing efforts will continue to be managed by Fred.\rUpstream Products =01) this group, lead by Jean Mrha, will develop several=\r=20\rdistinct product offerings for the upstream segment of the gas market.   Thi=\rs=20\rgroup will develop and market the product in conjunction with the regions.=\r=20\rThis is consistent with our desire to have a broader product offering and=\r=20\rgreater market penetration in the upstream segment.   These products include=\r=20\rproducer outsourcing, similar to our successful Petro-Canada and Suncor=20\rrelationships in Canada, physical storage re-engineering, compressor=20\rservices, wellhead liquidity products and offshore asset and capital=20\rproducts.   In addition, Jean will manage our Bridgeline joint venture with=\r=20\rTexaco. =20\rGas Structuring =01) this group will be lead by Ed McMichael, reporting to =\rFrank=20\rVickers, will provide structuring and deal support to all the gas teams.\rGas Fundamentals =01) this group will be lead by Chris Gaskill, reporting t=\ro=20\rHunter Shively, will provide fundamentals to all the gas teams.   =20\r Julie Gomez will continue to support the gas floor through several identifi=\red=20\rprojects including long-term supply/demand analysis and, natural gas=20\rtransportation capacity trading opportunities.\r=20\rThere is an expectation of some customer overlap between the gas and power=\r=20\rgroups; for example, the combination utilities and the IPP=01,s.   The teams=\r will=20\rcoordinate with regard to the combination utilities like Con. Edison or=20\rPG&amp;E.   With regard to the IPP=01,s, to the extent that the product offering=\r=20\rinvolves an underlying power position, the power teams will manage. We have=\r=20\rasked Janet Dietrich to coordinate such overlaps between the two=20\rorganizations in Houston.=20\r e) Technical/Restructuring - In the effort to consolidate and centralize ou=\rr=20\rtechnical resources (engineering, development, operations, pipeline) to=20\rensure that this skill base is available to all ENA groups and utilized=20\rproductively across the organization, Brian Redmond will form and manage th=\re=20\rTechnical Services Group.   This group will manage ENA=01,s technical risks =\rand=20\rwill provide, on a cost basis, technical services for the entire ENA=20\rorganization. This group will manage the interface with EE&amp;CC and OEC.   In=\r=20\raddition, the Restructuring Group, currently managed by Dick Lydecker, will=\r=20\rreport to Brian Redmond.   This group is currently monetizing a large portio=\rn=20\rof the merchant investment portfolio given our current strategies.   This=20\rgroup will have continuing responsibility to manage troubled commodity and=\r=20\rcapital transactions that need considerable time and attention to manage ri=\rsk=20\rand monetize.=20\r In addition to these responsibilities, Brian will manage the pending sale a=\rnd=20\rtransition of the HPL asset over the next couple quarters as regulatory and=\r=20\rsecurities approvals are obtained in order to complete the sale.   Brian wil=\rl=20\rreport to the EA OOC.\r f) Principal Investing   =01)   with the departure of Jeff Donahue to new=20\ropportunities in EBS, ENA=01,s venture capital function will be managed by=\r=20\rMichael L. Miller.   This group makes small investments in distributed=20\rgeneration, power quality and technology companies that can benefit from=20\rEnron=01,s distribution channels and expertise.   Michael will report to the=\r EA=20\rOOC.\r g) Corporate Development =01) Tim Detmering will assume the corporate=20\rdevelopment responsibilities for ENA as Jeff transitions to his new role an=\rd=20\rwill report to the EA OOC.\r h) Generation Investments =01) there will be no changes to this group manag=\red by=20\rDave Duran. Dave will continue to report to the EA OOC.\r i) Energy Capital Resources =01) there will be no changes to this group=20\rcurrently lead by C. John Thompson and Scott Josey.   John and Scott will=20\rcontinue to report to the EA OOC.\r As a final note in the interest of keeping things simple, Enron Americas wi=\rll=20\rhave two operating divisions   - Enron North America and Enron South America=\r. =20\rAs a result, we will continue to conduct business under these two operating=\r=20\rcompanies; therefore, eliminating the need to change legal entities et al. =\r=20\rIf you are currently a commercial employee of ENA or ESA you will continue =\rto=20\rconduct business in that company.=20\r We look forward to another exciting year in the North American energy=20\rmarket.   This is certainly a company unrivaled in the marketplace with the=\r=20\rmost talented employees.   The opportunities are endless.   We wish you and=\r=20\ryour family a very happy and safe holiday season.\r\n"

JinSung had apprised me that things went well and in San Antonio I ran into Dave Delainey and he was very happy with the whole thing.With the current NetWorks structure, and considering the benefits you have derived, we want to charge you a nominal amount for each of these data rooms.   We want to bill you 25k for each data room for a total of 175k.I know that at the beginning of the deal you had asked me this question and my answer was 'we aint charging you' but the business model for us has changed and we need to show revenues and income to external customers and external partners we are trying to get to.   Hence we want to bill internal customers whatever is the reasonable price of the service offered.I will call you later to discuss ( I did mention to Dave in San Antonio I was going to have to do this, considering my business situation)Harry\n"

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 10/03/2000 01:19 PM ---   \tFrom:   Jean Mrha @ ENRON   09/27/2000 04:21 PM To: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, W Tom Byargeon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Gomez, Chris Hilgert/HOU/ECT@ect Subject: Re: Devil's Tower   David,Devils Tower is a deepwater project on Mississippi Canyon block 7773.   Dominion is the operator and has a 60% working interest in the project.   Mariner Energy (20%) and Pioneer Resources (20%) are the remaining working interest owners.During the first week of September, Production Offshore, managed by Tom Byargeon, received an RFP and an information packet to submit a proposal for the development of a floating production system and export pipelines.Since the Devils Towers project exists in a prolific active deepwater reserve area and this area has little developed infrastructure, this project is strategic and creates a very relevant and marketable infrastructure position.   For example, Exxon has indicated their interest in tying back their production from Crazy Horse (south of Devils Tower) to this platform.   In addition, the production from this platform could be funneled into Exxon's export pipelines on the shelf.This project will financed by a structure where Enron forms a joint venture (JV) with an independent third party.   The joint venture partners capitalize the JV with a nominal amount of funds.   The JV leases capacity on the platform and export pipelines from a special purpose vehicle (SPV).   The SPV uses the lease agreement to obtain a loan from financial institutions.   In turn, the SPV uses equity capital (from a tax based investor) and the loan proceeds to purchase or develop the deepwater assets.The JV receives cash flows from leasing the production capacity from the Devils Tower deepwater assets.   This capacity on the deepwater assets will be sold for five to seven years under a production handling agreement (PHA).   Final point, the JV receives a financial instrument (most likely a note receivable)   equal to their portion of the net proceeds from the PHA.Enron books income on the monetization of this financial instrument via a FASB sell down (most likely, selling a note receivable to a bank for cash).   In addition, because the lease capacity for the deepwater assets will be sold for only five-seven years and these assets will have a minimum working life for twenty, there exists potential upside for Enron.   For example, cash flows from incremental PHAs (ie., through tiebacks to Devils Tower deepwater assets) can be monetized via the FASB 125 sell down.The financial structure was designed to minimize capital outlays and financial risk.   Also, Joe Deffner and Roger Ondreko are very familar with the structure and assisted in its design.The RFP is due October 2nd.   There will a meeting tommorrow from 1-3 pm to discuss the status of the proposal in EB 3583. Please feel free to attend.Regards, JeanDavid W Delainey@ECT09/27/2000 01:26 PMTo: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jean Mrha/NA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: Devil's TowerGuys, can you give me an update on what this deal is about - e-mail would be fine?RegardsDelainey\n"

      "body": "\nJoe, where is the arb? Ultimately, this cannot be a cost of capital play given the owners.   Is this primarily an off-balance sheet issue for the customer?   Are we taking disposal or terminal value risk on the facility?   Operational risk? Did we come up with this structure or was this the mandated structure in the RFP?Is this a play that you would support? On a previous issue, do you feel confident that we can monetize the El Paso note on the ECP sale at the 8.25%?   It is important for us to be able to quickly monetize this note for obvious reasons.How is it going otherwise?RegardsDelainey---"

I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of you if he needs to.   Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to \"Regional Management\" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and Trading. Thanks and good luck! ---",

We are currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.   They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.   At this point, there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items and credit arrangements).   However, we expect that the pace of the negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for about 2-3 hours).Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:Origination/Marketing:   John Llodra, George WoodLegal:   Janice MooreRegulatory/Governmental:   Daniel AllegrettiCommodity Structuring:   Jim Meyn, Zach SampsonCredit:   Edward Sacks, Tracy NgoAttached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.   Items subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with CMP over the next couple of days.   Once agreement is reached with CMP on outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.   Please feel free to call me at 978-4449-99936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-32223, 3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to date.

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 02/09/20001 09:01 AM ---Matthew Scrimshaw02/09/20001 03:04 AMTo: Enron London EES Groupcc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet R Dietrich/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan Leff/HOU/EEES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EEES@EES, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing ReorganisationIntroductionEES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of progress has been made.   The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.   We now have a much clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are most comfortable.The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad retail energy business.   With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.We now have a renewed focus in 20001.   The emphasis will be to work on only the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.   The main thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.   Commodity is Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to generate sizeable gross margin at closure.   DSM projects are also important as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the commodity competition.   We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.   Whilst we retain an understanding of O&amp;M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only consider involvement in an O&amp;M capacity on attractive margin transactions where it is essential to the customer.   As the business develops it is likely that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&amp;M delivery capability to enhance the product offering in the future.In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in conjunction with a DSM project offering.   This knowledge based business will allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale business.   URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to create a pan European URS competence.Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal development.   Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for EES Europe.   Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this area.OrganisationAfter eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first half of 20001.   In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully launched.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for the business.Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.   Stuart will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain appropriately focussed.   Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality prospects.Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.   Hala will report to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is appointed.Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of a Position Management activity.The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure of EES Europe which is effective immediately.   Whilst these charts are relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for individuals.   Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in the near future.At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff meeting.   At this session we will talk about the 20001 Earnings Plan and provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind it.   Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may have.   I look forward to seeing you there.Matthew\n"

I'll give you a call to discuss further.Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday: - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron and EES; - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 20001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 20001; - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for the large industrial customer); - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that effort; - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals; - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - no bullshit politics; - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership; - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success; - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February early March.PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.Talk to you soon!!!RegardsDelainey---"

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 02/09/20001 09:01 AM ---Matthew Scrimshaw02/09/20001 03:04 AMTo: Enron London EES Groupcc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet R Dietrich/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dan Leff/HOU/EEES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EEES@EES, Richard Lewis/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing ReorganisationIntroductionEES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of progress has been made.   The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.   We now have a much clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are most comfortable.The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad retail energy business.   With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.We now have a renewed focus in 20001.   The emphasis will be to work on only the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.   The main thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.   Commodity is Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to generate sizeable gross margin at closure.   DSM projects are also important as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the commodity competition.   We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.   Whilst we retain an understanding of O&amp;M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only consider involvement in an O&amp;M capacity on attractive margin transactions where it is essential to the customer.   As the business develops it is likely that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&amp;M delivery capability to enhance the product offering in the future.In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in conjunction with a DSM project offering.   This knowledge based business will allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale business.   URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to create a pan European URS competence.Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal development.   Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for EES Europe.   Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this area.OrganisationAfter eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first half of 20001.   In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully launched.   I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for the business.Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.   Stuart will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain appropriately focussed.   Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality prospects.Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.   Hala will report to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is appointed.Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of a Position Management activity.The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure of EES Europe which is effective immediately.   Whilst these charts are relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for individuals.   Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in the near future.At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff meeting.   At this session we will talk about the 20001 Earnings Plan and provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind it.   Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may have.   I look forward to seeing you there.Matthew\n"

I'll give you a call to discuss further.Couple of points, I would hope you would share with your group on Monday: - the European retail business is an important and strategic focus for Enron and EES; - it encompases a material part of EES's and Enron Europes margin plan for 20001 - so execution and most probably over performance is key in 20001; - it was birthplace of one of the key EES distribution platforms that needs to be migrated to North America - Enron Direct and the ITOL structure (for the large industrial customer); - the European business IS one of the largest growth opportunities going forward for EES and EES management will recognize, resource and reward that effort; - I am very involved in business strategy, execution and deals; - I believe in open communication, performance and high performance teams - no bullshit politics; - I recognize and reward performance, thinking, execution and leadership; - I flourish in a culture of ideas, fast action and success; - and I will be visiting London to meet everyone probably late February early March.PS - I am already a citizen of the Commonwealth.Talk to you soon!!!RegardsDelainey---",

Dave believe the up side could be as much as $150mm and the downside as much as $3000mm (the difference between best and worst prices/sales).My suggestion is that we do the following and I would like your comments or concerns if any:Enter into contracts or an agreement (the later would be one way - us to them and obviously easier) with each of them outlining the following:Bonus targets based on financial targets and PRC performance for calendar 01 (ie if you rank in top 3 categories and you realise over $650 from this project we will pay you not less than $3000k)Equity award on closing, on the basis of successful closure and above line value (ie only in the event that this closes in June 01 and realises more than $650mm we will grant you $2000k in options, if above $8000m then $350k in options.)Dave would like for me to get back to him on this asap.David\n"

I also met with Greg Wolfe. and Tim B. to get their feedback as to how the East Desk Middle Market Reports reports should be used/modified for the West.   As a result of these discussions, along with discussions with others in the Middle Market Group, effective October 1, we will begin to more systematically measure certain behaviors, such as customer telephone calls, in addition to origination.   By focusing on behaviors, and not simply results, our hope is to expand the pool of customers and information and improve our marketing effort.   I will be working with Ed to try to standarize the approach within EPMI.It is my understanding that you will be in Portland for a QBR toward the end of October.   I look forward to reviewing our plans for coverage metrics and our first results with you then.   Let me know if you want to discuss this approach prior to your visit.

In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.   I am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.   As well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that   you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups.   Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.   Upon agreement on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the East.RegardsDelainey---",

To my knowledge, the last time it was brought to his attention was March 1999 (Blue Range default).   We do report our top exposures to him and the Board which includes CNR, Petro-Canada, and Talisman on a quarterly basis.   Rob and team are actively working with my team to mitigate exposures through other measures.b) I will be happy to provide insight as needed.   The riskiest commercial objections are from Lagrasta's group.c) We have received margin from Sempra and Duke.   We have a valuation dispute with Statoil and are actively working through the details.Let me know if you need further information.BillDavid W Delainey05/01/2000 07:04 PMTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, Edward Ondarza/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Raymond Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: Excess Credit ExposureGuys, I went throught the Credit Margin Exception Report for 4/24/000.   This shows our excess credit exposure at approximately $ 391M (after guarantees).   I have a couple of questions: a) Canada (&lt;$2000M) - Rick/Bill/Rob - Is the board and Skilling aware of the credit positions and OK?   I know Rob has been working on   mitigation plans; b) Commercial Objections: (&lt;$67M)   - Paper - Edward ($27M) - The report shows a number of commerical objections to calling for collateral ie) Repap,   Times Mirror and Waste   Mgt. Can you give me a call to discuss - we may need documentation to support;   - Gas/Mid-Mkt - Jeff ($29M)- Do you own Cross Timbers Oil Co, Torch Energy, Aurora Natural Gas, Seneca Resource Corp and Cody Energy?   We have in these cases additional commercial objections to calling for collateral - lets discuss;   - Mariner   ($9M)- Ray we are showing a collateral need of approx. $9.0M - given our equity position this may be moot;however, lets discuss. c) Margin Call (&lt;$51M) - Rick/Bill - have we been successful in getting the margin posted by Sempra, Statoil and Duke?Canada is a tricky issue; however, we should be able to work down the commercial objections and collect on the margin calls to get the number down.

To that end, I assessed every single originated transaciton when I took over the group in 1999.   Edith Cross and I turned over every rock that we could find, booked things properly, and moved on.   I know nothing about this amortization that's been going on.   Perhaps there were two payments to Fort James --- one being the payment that west power trading expensed in 19997 associated with the in money Wauna/Halsey position and the other associated with the overall alliance.   West Power Trading very clearly liquidated the payment associated with Wauna/Halsey in 19997.   I have the DPR from March of 19997 to prove it.   If this payment was capitalized for some reason after West Power Trading expensed it, then I'm not sure what to do.   It seems odd for us to pay for the same bad position twice.   If the amortization is associated with the second payment to Fort James --- the alliance payment --- then we have a different kettle of fish entirely.   I don't understand why it was ok for the amotization to hit the industrial group but when we do a one-time amortization of the balance it all of a sudden switches over to the West Power Trading group.   How come last month it was \"proper\" for the charge to hit the industrial group and this month it is \"proper\" for the charge to hit West Power Trading.   The charge should hit whoever's rc it was who thought that paying Fort James a bunch of money was a good idea.   If that person is no longer around the charge should either hit that person's successor or it should hit a management book.To your point about who benefits from the termination of this deal.   Clearly, it is a good idea to terminate these deals and remove bad positions with a lot of uncertainty from the West Power Trading books.   Having said that, I have a hard time feeling good about the \"benefit\" that West Power Trading has received from these deals.   In 1999 I was told that this was largely a legal question.   A memo written by Jake Thomas on April 7, 1999 memorializes this line of thought.   We established a $5000k legal reserve, rebooked the deals, took most of the positive value to the book to offset large losses associated with other old deals and granted the remainder, about $1 million, to Jake in origination.   The entity that has benefited the most from these deals is West Origination.Finally, I can't see how this expense belongs to West Power Trading.   I would like to understand how all of the accounting worked before I can accept an expense on my rc.   If you want to deal with the expense separately and have a discussion about granting origination for terminating this deal then let's do that.   That discussion needs to reflect history, and include the origination that was granted in 19997, 1999, and include the legal reserve of $5000k.Give me a call when you get a chance.David W Delainey06/16/2000 05:111 PMTo: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Fort James AmortizationTim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $111.0M) has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville and Ondarza).   As you are aware, I sued them for breach.   The settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.   It is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland shop.   The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.   It seemed logical to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability.Lets discuss.RegardsDelainey---",

When the deal was closed, west power trading booked an in the money position and an offsetting expense of about $111 million.   This money has already liquidated from our book.   In fact, I have a copy of the 3/31/97 DPR that reflects this liquidation.   At that time, west power trading also paid a 350k credit reserve, 247k to the finance book, and 1.3 million in origination.   I have also heard about a \"partnership\" fee that Enron paid to Fort James around the same time.   I'm not sure what this fee was and who benefitted from it.   It had nothing to do with the west power trading book.On John's recommendation I called Wes to see if we could figure this out.   Wes, please give me a call back to discuss.   I think that someone needs to look at the actual journal entries from March of 19997 to see why an expense of $111 million was deferred.This is not my problem.   I should not receive this expense.   Until this is resolved, I would greatly appreciate it if the writedown of the deferred account does not hit west power trading's expenses.\n"

I requested Westinghouse begin to prepare for this work on Sunday after you confirmed that we could no longer tolerate the operating restriction being added to the unit.   Based on discussions with Westinghouse on Sunday, we estimated that the work could be completed in 14 days.   The site began disassembly of unit #2 on Monday.   Unit #1 disassembly began on Tuesday because we had to wait for the unit to cool down.   The first verbal schedule from Westinghouse was received Monday night.   It showed the blade rings being machined in series at a single shop and resulted in the lasy unit being delayed about 4 days.   I told Westinghouse this would not be acceptable and that the blade rings needed to be machined in parallel.   Westinghouse agreed and has made a second shop available.   Another schedule was published yesterday afternoon that required an additional step in the disassembly that I felt was not required and added a day to the duration.   Westinghouse suggested that we remove the compressor blades from the rotor before we remove the blade rings.   I have since concluded that removing the rotor blades first is in fact the correct procedure. As we discussed at the meeting this morning, this schedule for the blade rings, which has been at the site since last night,   will be distributed to everyone today.   In addition, the site will incorporate the remaining startup activities and issue an integrated schedule tonight.As we discussed at the meeting this morning, it is very unlikely that Gleason #1 and #2 can be available by June 1.   Our optimistic estimate from the meeting this morning was June 4-7.GavinTo: John Normand/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Gavin Gaul/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Mike J Miller/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mitch Robinson/Corp/Enron@Enron, David W Delainey@ECT, Robert P Virgo@ECT, Bill Fox/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Larry L Izzo/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Gleason Blade Ring ScheduleJohn/Gavin -We have made progress over the last week in getting GE attention focused on the emissions problems at Lincoln.   After 6 days of daily conferences on the subject, GE has arrived in force at Lincoln, with the personnel and resources required to address the problem.   We are not out of the woods yet, but I believe everything is now being done that can be done to get as many machines available as possible by June 1.Enron needs the same focus from Westinghouse, on   issues currently plagueing Wheatland and Gleason.   Unlike Lincoln, where the machines are capable of producing MW's, these two sites have units that cannot operate.   Namely, vibration issues on units 1 and 2 at Wheatland and compressor blade ring issues on units 1 and 2 at Gleason.ENA has been requesting since Monday this week, a definitve and complete schedule from EECC, showing the disassembly, shipping, machining, reassembly and testing of units 1 and 2 blade rings at Gleason.   We still do not have this schedule.   Furthermore, it would appear that after this morning's meeting, there is some confusion on what work actually needs to be performed in order to accomplish this task and what impact that may have on the 14-day schedule committed to ENA by Gavin Gaul on 5/15.   I am not sure whether the communication breakdown is between business units at Westinghouse or between Enron and Westinghouse, but a schedule and plan is the first step towards getting the work done and we are two days into the work.   I am expecting this plan to be circulated today.Lastly, although we have been verbally assured by Westinghouse that there will be no operating restrictions, other than routine borescope inspections during off-peak periods, OEC would be more comfortable getting this in writing.   We are requesting a formal notice from Westinghouse, identifying any operational restrictions (post-blade ring repair) on these units.If there is any assistance you require, please do not hesitate to request it.   We collectively have 14 days to declare all 15 units ready for commercial operation.MSD \n"

Since the market is valuing Genco assets at a much higher multiple, a bid at book value for the transco would be very intriguing to the existing shareholder base.Given a high probability of supply shortage in Florida over the next 2-4 years, the transmission gateway to Florida is extremely valuable, particularly if expansions are done off the existing system.In addition, it would give Enron tremendous regulatory leverage with the pending Entergy/FPL (SOCO connects systems), and the entire SE market, including TVA.I know it's a longshot, but we will have to do something radical to bust open the SE market into a free functioning commodity market.   The SE is essentially untapped from a power trading standpoint right now, and the market is nearly 2000,000 MW if you include Florida.\n"

We have an agreed turbine purchase contract that we have executed and that Enron Nigeria are supposed to execute today.   Per our discussion, Wes C.   suggested that we push the $2.0MM additional write down as well as the $7.1 turbine purchase revenue to Q4.Status of LIPA/Barges:   We are working in two directions.   Currently, we are:   1. Finding a buyer for either the LIPA PPA/Barges together, or just the barges by themselves2. Discussing with LIPA, the Power Desk, and BargeCo to find an acceptable PPA structure and barge price to meet our risk/return criteria.The decision tree for the LIPA deal is as follows:IF: The LIPA PPA can be structured to be unit contingent for energy,   AND: The power desk can get comfortable with the capacity availability risk (discussions ongoing)   AND: The economics of the deal are acceptable given the price for replacement capacity charged by the desk.   AND: All permitting issues are either resolved or resolvableOR,IF: We can find an \"as-is, where-is\" buyer for the Barges with/without the PPA (ConEd, Montauk, NRG)THEN:   ENA will purchase the barges from BargeCo (Barges are currently located in Brooklyn) ELSE:   We will not purchase the barges and will shut down the LIPA deal.   1. LIPA:   We will fall back on permitting issues and schedule to as a reason to stop working on the deal.2. BargeCo:   The barges will have a lower performance than what was originally stated by BargeCo.   Additional capital investment would be required to meet our performance requirements - our position is that this additional cost must be borne by BargeCo.   We do not, however, want to implement this action until we have sold the 6B turbines to Enron Nigeria so that we are sure this transaction is completed.David W Delainey09/29/2000 08:25 AMTo: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jean Mrha/NA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: LIPAGuys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?

Look fwd to supporting your effort as needed!   Just to insure that ENA and RAC aren't duplicating efforts..., we have been told by Rick Buy that he wanted RAC to keep the Enron Turbine \"book\" (with input from other business units), and have just concluded multiple sessions w/ RAC to xfer that function to them (I think we invited your team to those sessions).   Rick Carson/RAC is working on a format that can be used by multiple parties, including board presentations.   The idea was that different business units (ENA,,, EECC, etc) could provide input, and..., RAC's involvement would enhance the list.   If ENA is going to keep \"the turbine book\" - maybe RAC doesn't need to (none of our business, but..., doesn't seem like RAC needs to be doing the same thing you are doing).   Who from ENA could discuss this w/ Dave Gorte (Rick's on vacation)?

Has the mid-year performance evaluation been reviewed? Has his two direct supervisors been contacted (Ozzie Pagan and Gil Muhl) for specific input into this? Once all this has been confirmed and everyone has agreed, you should make a decision to either re-deploy him to another area or offer him a severence package.

However, I want to keep a strong presence in both markets and understand the language, political and cultural issues. I may be asking for my cake and eat it too; however, I believe that you guys will find the balance.   There is no need for you to leave Argentina - its up to you, Joe and Orlando to determine consistent with the business model we are trying to move forward.Propose to me a plan that manages your concerns but gets us as close to these ideals as possible at a cost that is reasonable.

As of today, Oregon is sill moving forward with our version ofopen access.   As you may recall, this is a fairly consevative approach.   Onlynon-residential customers are eligible for direct access.   Utilities need notsell any generating resources.   We will use a technique called \"ongoingvaluation\" to allow non-residentials to elect other suppliers while stillreceiving the benefits/paying the costs of our current supplies.   We areplanning to be in balance (or long) for 20002 on a full load basis.   Thus,while non-residential customers may elect new suppliers, they are essentiallyfully hedged with our portfolio of long- and short-term supplies.   We havealso begun to raise the question for discussion whether we should fill a fulload position for years beyond 20002.   Those discussions will probably continuethe next couple of months.   One possible outcome is that we would fill all ofour load except perhaps customers over 1-5 MWs.   They would have the right to\"opt-out\" by giving us notice 1/1/02 not to plan for them beginning 1/1/03. Then, the Commission might phase in this option for consecutively smaller loadcustomers on a set schedule.   This would allow us some certainty and abilityto make longer-term commitments and also give the market some certainty aboutwhat load might be available when.   Everyone is well-aware of our shortposition and the implications of that.   We are seeking an amendment toOregon's restructuring law that would eliminate any date restriction on ourability to treat resource commitments as eligible for transition treatment.   Ithink this is a critical piece to ensuring that Oregon doesn't set up a clifflike California did or Nevada appears to be doing.   All this being said,whether Oregon's restructuring moves forward is ultimately anemotional/political issue.   Bad news, even if unrelated to direct access,could spook the Legislature enough to give momentum to the several billsalready introduced to delay/reverse it.   We will keep you informed. Meanwhile, our power supply folks are proceeding as if we will need to planfor almost everyone indefinitely.&lt;&lt;&lt; Jim Piro 01/26/01 02:26PM &lt;&lt;&lt;I think based upon your discussions with staff and the commissioners you arethe best one to respond to this question.

What sentiment are you hearing in Oregon about open access? (In Nevada, where I have been focused of late, the drums are beating louder for longer delays). If open access (customer choice) is deferred beyond this year, how do you plan to cover this short position, especially in '02? Does the OPUC appreciate that you are short in anticipation of open access? Thanks, Mitch\n"

The goal would be to have a definitive strategy for HPL and storage assets by the end of July that could be acted upon. a) Elimination of the Entex contract - current value - John L.; b) Storage value algorithm incorporating spread values, increasing intra-day and monthly volatility and blowdown values - Jean M, John L, Jim S.; c) Storage acquisition targets and issues surrounding value/execution - top 5 to 10 for blowdown and tarantula strategy - Jean M, Julie G.; d) Structure, value, cost and issues surrounding Bammel \"header\" - Jean M.; e) Project Torque - definitive balance sheet, income statement and contribution margin statement for HPL - Wes C.; f) Establish viability of selling HPL assets - small private placement - working with Lehman to finalize value, exection risk, timing, structure et al - Patrick   W.   I would like this group to get back together in the fourth week of July to determine a final action plan.RegardsDelainey \n"

The owners have also agreed to a structure in principle, whereby they have determined a range that they are willing to sell at. If enron exceeds the range, they are bound to sell it to Houston P&amp;P group. If we bid inside the range they then have 8 weeks to shop us, and if they dont receive any offers, enron buys the mill at our bid less C$5MM. If they shop us and receive a third party offer, they pay enron a break fee of C$5MM. If they close with a third party, we receive an additional C$10MM. At a minimum, this provides us with a fair market valuation by an independent/outside party that we can use as our basis for writing up the asset. Secondly, it allows the P&amp;P group to bid without being a stalking horse as it provides for hefty break fees and significant earnings on closing. With regards to tax mitigation, I will have a better idea by the end of this week. The tax guys are up from Houston and we will be working on it the remainder of the week.fyi...British Energy is now worth &lt;C$1000MM at the desk's bid. We are still working toward a May 1, 20001 market opening.

They would prefer manufacturers that have over 10% of their cost of goods sold as energy and have DSM projects completed at their facilities.   ENA has solicited my support in getting these references because when they asked EES Sales, they found them not to be overly cooperative with supplying names out of fear that ENA may burn out EES customers before EES Sales can use them.   Since EES customers fall under Jeff's pervue, I need your help in getting the go-ahead to approach the account managers to set this up.   My suggestions would be World Color Press, Package Ice, Polaroid, or Ocean Spray.   Suiza would be a good choice if we could get the right person.

At the risk of being bold,   I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.   Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.   With the back and mid office,   the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.   Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.   Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.   Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.RegardsDelainey ---",
        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 111/02/2000 09:41 AM ---Rob Milnthorp111/02/2000 09:17 AMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Reporting StructureDave, at the risk of rocking the boat, I would like you to consider the following. As you know, with the exception of Origination &amp; Finance, all other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, &amp; IT) report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given somewhat reluctantly because the manager   in Houston has really no idea whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very demotivated lawyer on my hands.Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to \"stay in the loop\" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a dollar and time perspective.   Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between Houston and the employee.I would appreciate your thoughts on this.RegardsMilnthorp\n"

The idea here was not to explain the retail product offering or any concern of dropping the ball, rather a one off download of where we currently stand in South America   and high level overview of   how to work together to keep everyone on the same sheet of music and not miss   a beat.   For instance, there is already a local staff in place to handle initial deal flow (which is already happening) that needs to benefit from Dan's systems and best practices, but which has already based what they are doing on how Dan operates.   We have always benefited from as much of Dan's and Marty's attention as we could get over the past year and a half as we set this up.   By the same token we can't be competitive in this business in Brazil on a cost basis from Houston, so that is why we have formed local staff based on EES systems and practices, and hopefully some controls as we go forward.   It is late here and my assistant is gone but I think the meeting is already scheduled.

I have a good understanding of the retail product offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority shareholders.   I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.   I already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business initially.

Liebert (working for Dan L. on EE&amp;CC) to discuss the memo I sent out on the Tech Services Group.   During the discussion we identified several areas where EES' view diverges from the view in my memo that ENA will manage its own technical risk and will be supported by EE&amp;CC.   Currently, EES is headed in the following direction:1. EE&amp;CC will manage all technical risk in Enron as part of a consolidated technical risk book. 2. EE&amp;CC will be the sign off on all DASH's with respect to technical risk.3. EE&amp;CC is still trying to work out how their services will be charged to the business units - not sure what \"cost\" is.This central decision is (1.) above.   If EES is going to manage ENA's technical risk then the balance between managing engineering cost and managing technical risk will be eliminated.   Essentially we will be back to a ENA (origination) vs. EE&amp;CC (construction) relationship where we argue about how much money they are spending and the amount of overhead that is included in their \"cost\".   Your thoughts on this?We didn't draw any lines and agreed to keep discussing to make this work.   I would suggest that either I can meet with Dan L. to understand his views or that we have another joint meeting with you and Dan's team to resolve.Regards,BrianDavid W Delainey01/31/20001 03:111 PMTo: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: ReviewsBrian, I assume that you are doing the review for Bob Virgo, Wayne Mays, Jean Mrha and Julie Gomez.RegardsDelainey\n"

Regarding an update for Toronto, we made an offer to a senior industrial marketer yesterday   (Jeff Borg - 10 years experience) while I was in Toronto. I believe that he will accept. In addition, Paul is interviewing for one more deal maker (targeting John Guerro at Duke - an industrial gas marketer) and a manager for ENERconnect   (has interviewed a couple - meeting with Doug Jones from TD Bank next week). Scott Gilbert who is running our volume management is out recruiting for backoffice staff (needs 5 specialists). No success here as of yet.Mark Haedicke, Peter Keohane and myself are working on transferring Chris Gaffney (Canadian Lawyer) to work in Toronto. Chris is interested and both Mark and myself think it would be a good fit/career move.Dawn, Paul and myself are devising a more aggressive recruiting strategy for Toronto for both Paul's and Scott's groups as our presence in Toronto is limited. This may include full page ads in the Globe, use of head hunters and/or Super Saturdays. With 2 million people in Toronto, we should be having more success in recruiting high quality individuals.It is my understanding that 94 new analysts are starting this August in Houston. I need a minimum of 5 (2 for Toronto, 3 for Calgary). I have asked Dawn to make this happen, but if there is any way that you can exercise your influence to assist in making this happen, that would be much appreciated. RegardsMilnthorp\n"

Naturally, the list includes numerous Mexican and Canadian firms which fell out of the screen.

Many of these firms have sites accross the continent and it is important to portfolio effect their assets to make the transaction work.

You were very clear on the point that ENA Industrial Marketing had enough to do South of the border. We have staffed up our Industrial Marketing Team in Toronto and are covering all industrials (on a full-time basis) which meet our load threshold in Ontario. Unlike the U.S., Ontario is a relatively small market where we can and have complete coverage. Paul and his group have done a tremendous job at positioning Enron in this marketplace, demonstrating our core competencies, and developing credibility. The last thing I want is some marketer up here from the U.S. selling the box without knowing how to fill that box (ie does not know the market fundamentals, rules or regulatory regime). This does nothing for Enron as it confuses the customer on who they should be talking to and destroys whatever credibility we had created to date. I have attached for your reference, a status report on industrial coverage.Perhaps the problem lies in how we are defining outsourcing. As you know, there exists a continuum from portfolio management through to the energy island concept. Enron Canada has been pitching the entire outsourcing continuum recognizing that for many of these industrials, they will want to walk before they run. The majority that we have talked to are interested in portfolio management, our market expertise &amp; information, wholesale settlement services, and assistance with market opening readiness. I cant imagine how a U.S. originator could talk to or offer these services to Canadian Industrials. This is clearly in Enron Canada's wheelhouse.With respect to the opposite side of the outsourcing continuum, it makes total sense to have ENA utilize its resources in pursuing energy island, asset outsourcing type structures. With these opportunities, I see ENA taking the lead with ECC second chair. Where these opportunities are identified by ECC, we will forward these to the appropriate ENA originator. To date, ENA and ECC have worked well on Blue Circle, Terra, Co-Steel and Nexfor.As for Tembec, I am confused with what you mean by not changing the deal team. Kelli Metcalf has been up here twice talking to Tembec about a cogen in an area that does not make any economic sense. Jan and Paul have met with Tembec a number of times and we have had extensive discussions with Tembec specific to Ontario, Portfolio Management, Wholesale Settlement Services, Supply Procurement, and Asset Optimization. I realize that Bryan Burnett has an excellent relationship with Tembec and we should leverage off of this, but to simply \"keep ECC in the loop\" is fundamentally absurd and is not in Enron's best interests.RegardsMilnthorpDavid W Delainey08/03/2000 12:09 PMTo: Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, Max Yzaguirre/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rodney Malcolm/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bryan Burnett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Raymond Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Devries/TOR/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Tembec and US OriginatorsGuys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes: a) P&amp;P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination; b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron Mexico;   c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in Houston should provide a winning team.   I am asking for the three teams to clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer (ASAP).   I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.   Either way, I am expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for Canada and Mexico; and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to ECC.RegardsDelainey ---",

My understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian Facilities.2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp &amp; Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp &amp; Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.   ECC will cover these industrials for all other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs to be co-ordinated.Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US facilities.It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.   In the interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing arrangement.Regards,Angela McCulloch for   Rob MilnthorpAssistant to Rob Milnthorp(403) 974-6738---",

While the meeting went well, I am very confused about the Enron team making the pitch to them.   My understanding is that the Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps and to some extent, new SPV's.In this instance,1.   Tembec is a Canadian Company2.   All their assets are in Canada3.   Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility4.   We know the executive team at Tembec5.   We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy market which is their focus right now6.   We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement similar to the US pitchesWith this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.   Kelly was quite vocal in saying that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.   I have stated to her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.   Obviously, much of the technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.   However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this office!!!I thought this had been agreed to already.   We managed to piece up the meeting and deliver the \"Enron\" message, but going forward we need to have this resolved.Cheers, Paul D\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nRob, we may be saying the same thing here - for the EES outsourcing proposition (which is more than just asset management) as being defined by Rodney et al should be managed together by Industrial Origination and ECC.   Although, I would agree that ECC should lead the sale process.   My view is that we should not and will not recreate the structuring, customer facing and execution requirements in Canada and Mexico required to do these deals. It is an important strategic iniative for ENA to complete a number of these deals. The problem is that a clear target list, joint accountabilities and schedule between the groups has not been rolled out which was discussed at Columbia Lakes.   All other industrial business other than P&amp;P commodity/asset business is the perview of ECC.Ultimately, I have not seen any outsourcing transactions from Canada in the deal structuring/due diligence queue.   The US group can help get these done and can help in the pitch.RegardsDelainey---"

Find an acceptable structure for the LIPA PPA (unit contingent - no replacement energy risk) and complete the transaction.   LIPA is aware of our issues and is considering how they want to proceed.2. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to LIPA - probably the best case scenario.3. Don't come to terms on the PPA and sell the barges to ConEd, Morgan Stanley, AES or NRG (we are now in the process of agreeing CAs with these parties with respect to an infor memo on the barges/deal), or4. Let BargeCo keep the barges (technically they still own them now).The time frame for resolving this is Q4.Regards,Brian David W Delainey10/111/2000 09:30 AMTo: Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, Janet R Dietrich/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christopher F Calger/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Un-allocated TurbinesGuys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $1000M in nominal value):   a) 2 power barges - Brian - $13M   b) 2 ABB 111N1 - Rob- $35M   c) 1 501D5A - Janet/Chris - $25M   d) 1 7EA - Janet/Chris- $20MAll other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects.

Maybe not all his fault...I do not have enough data.He wants to push Brazil as important Wholesale market (ie pulp &amp; paper, ags, metals).   I think this is sound and worth looking at.   But I think this should be looked at by those groups.   They set their priorities.   If they want to pay for him being down there, we can house him and coordinate etc.   But I am going back to basics with energy and can not afford someone pushing something for the good of Enron on my P/L.   Probably narrow minded, but hopefully pragmatic on my part.I used him last to interface with Networks.   He is pretty fast out of the chute (market analysis, who's who in country etc.), but then levels off before tangible bottom line contribution (during my observation period anyway.)Probably more of a \"think tank\" guy and the \"think tank\" ain't in Brazil. (especially post reorg)So is he worth keeping for Enron?   I say yes, in the right role.   (worked for Cargill previously with Risk Management experience)   Does he fit with Enron Americas in South America?   I say no and have told him as much.Call if you need more.Thanks,KishDavid W Delainey@ECT12/06/2000 07:01 PMTo: Joe Kishkill/SA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: Joe, do you have a home for this guy - he desperately wants to stay in S.

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled Product unit.

ISOs and RTOs should only worry about transmission, not the price of the commodity they are transmitting.   Winning on this issue will be critical as RTOs are proposed throughout the country to meet Order 2000 obligations.   Also, Enron needs to really go after FERC for abdicating its wholesale market authority to ISOs, especially ISOs like in California that are dominated by state political figures.   FERC is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable rates, not some stakeholder Board established by state legislation.   We need to argue strongly that FERC must take back this authority in the near term and utilize its administrative procedures to impose any market changes.   Finally, given that it will be some period of time before there is truly a \"financially indifferent\" transmission provider under Order 2000, Enron must take an active role in working within and through the Boards of the current ISOs.   A good example is the way that Dan Allegretti works within the NE-ISO.   These Boards and the ISOs are fundamentally political organizations.   Our representatives must take the time to get to know the people so that when key issues arise, we are able to influence the decisions.Thanks, JimDavid W Delainey@ECT06/29/2000 12:222 PMTo: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EEES@EES, David Parquet/SF/ECT@ECTcc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/HOU/EEES@EES, Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: californiaGuys, good job with the California issues - we didn't get everything but we managed the position in a very effective manner.Jim, given our view to support the growth of the ISO structures as a necessary evil and given the socio-political leaning of these entities, should we be more actively or aggressively supporting or nominating directors on these boards?Jim/Rick, we need a full court press on this NEPool ICAP issue - Allegretti is putting plan in place.RegardsDelainey\n"

Re: the coal strategy, you're exactly right.   There is however one major impediment.   While locating the plant near/at the source (i.e., mine-mouth) will ease transport costs for coal, there aren't many major coal mines located in the prime market zones for power.   The transmission (wires) grid was not built to accomodate wholesale bulk trading/transport the way gas does and the impediments to expanding the grid are enormous (infinitely more so than building new plants).   For example, the average lead time to permit (not built, just permit) a high-voltage power line is 5-7 years!   As a result, a medium sized line (345kv, 2000 miles) can cost upwards of $1-2 billion!   That was the most frustrating part of the 18 months I chased this stuff.   While the basic solutions appear to be so logical, the business (the utilities), regulatory and environmental regimes are so backwardated in their thinking that breaking in was basically impossible.

Solving the power supply shortage is only part of the equation and your coal idea is legitimate as new technology can burn coal almost as clean as gas.   But until the FERC and state PUCs force the issue of expanding the grid to become a more \"fungible\" and integrated transmission system, the utilities will continue to operate in their vacuum as these transmission barriers are the only things protecting their turfs.   Even though some have given the appearance of forming RTO's/ISO's (regional transmission organizations or independent system operators) this is simply a facade of utilities banding together to cover each other's asses.   The assets are still owned by the utilities themselves and the RTO/ISO has no authority to mandate expansion or anything requiring capital investment, other than routine maintenance, etc...   That's the whole genesis of what I was trying to preach to FERC, various utilities who \"appeared\" to be more forward thinking about dereg, etc...

As you know, with the exception of Origination &amp; Finance, all other Canadian departments (Trading, Legal, Ops, Acctg, HR, Govt, &amp; IT) report directly to someone in Houston while having a dotted line to me. In my mind, this is completely backwards (ie. it should be a solid line to me, and a dotted line to their respective counterparts in Houston) for the following reasons. First, performance feedback is not communicated to these individuals in a timely manner if at all. Even when it is, more times than not, it is perfunctory in nature. In fact, I think that feedback is given somewhat reluctantly because the manager   in Houston has really no idea whether the individual in Canada is doing a good job or not. Second, it is sub-optimal. I seem to be spending more and more time dealing with issues between the Canadian employee and their respective manager in Houston. Many of these conversations revolve around my first point. Case and point, we almost lost Laura Scott earlier this year because she was feeling unappreciated and felt that her boss had no idea the hours/effort she was putting in. And just yesterday, I had a very unsatisfactory phone call with Mark Haedicke regarding Peter Keohane. The result - I now have a very demotivated lawyer on my hands.Third, it is costly. Having senior people fly up to Calgary/Toronto to \"stay in the loop\" and to complete performance reviews is both costly from both a dollar and time perspective.   Frankly, I'm not looking for more performance reviews to do, but I do think its important that staff receive meaningful feedback in a timely fashion. I know what these people do - I work with them every day. It is my job to lead, inspire, and motivate but lately it feels like it is my job to liase between Houston and the employee.I would appreciate your thoughts on this.RegardsMilnthorp\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nRob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.   At the risk of being bold,   I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.   Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.   With the back and mid office,   the current Enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.   Further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.   In the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.   Don't quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish some of these goals as well.In short, I would like to keep the reporting structures the same.   Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.RegardsDelainey ---"

I was located in India at the time, and project Summer was on at the time.   Hence, after a couple of initial attempts, I decided to wait a while before I sought a meeting with you.However, now with Project Summer behind us, I would like to meet with you to discuss potential opportunities in the North America Region.   I was part of the Associate pool at ECT, and have worked with Jim Fallon and Paula Rieker, among others.   I had then taken an assignment to work in India, and have been there for some years now.I am in Houston for the rest of the week and will be seeking to get on your calender for a brief chat on opportunities in your group.Regards,Sandeep.\n"

This result is obviously disappointing - - -   65% of   the 555 students from all schools got offers.   I will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.   If anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.   Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.   On the \"yeses\", please let me know who you would like to follow up on and encourage to accept.   We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process.

      "body": "\nWow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull... in the company we would be a $1000 stock.On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current A&amp;A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion   for the typical associate including timeline.   This process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.I think radical change is not the answer.   The answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally. Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.The goals of any restructuring are: a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the program; b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained; c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling and interviewing; d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly grounds the associate in the \"Enron technology\" which include skills in market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk; e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues; f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development, retention and performance tool; g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques, non-traditional sources of talent and h) increase cost effectiveness.The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units, people and teams, business tracks, etc.I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with a strawman.Let me know your thoughts.RegardsDelainey---"

As I mentioned,I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with AirProducts and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have readabout Enron.   Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends whomight be kind enough to \"keep their eyes open\" and share thoughts and ideasas to companies I should contact.I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.   Asyou can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strongoperations background.   I would certainly enjoy another position as anOperations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range ofindustries.   Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would bevery encouraging.   I am open to any avenues you suggest.Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.   Itseems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few selectintroductions.   Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or whocan direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.   The more contacts Imake, the more opportunities I can uncover.If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.   I will contact youagain in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.

In terms of our overall strategy for branding, this is likely the only initiative that we would pursue in 20001 as we like that it has good penetration for the entire province of Alberta as well as national exposure. The Labour day game draws the biggest crowd each season, has been sold out eight out the past nine seasons, and is the largest single day sporting event in Calgary each year.

Williams is their first choice at the moment purely driven on price. It sounds like Williams is willing to effectively provide natural gas at a   below-market fixed price. Both Williams and Duke were comparable on price. Enron and Southern are close on price and just behind the Duke/Williams pricing. Although Ronnie claims everyone is \"right there together\", the small pricing difference is significant when looked at over 15 years. Williams will be with Ronnie soon (next couple weeks) to begin discussing contract language. He says documents aren't signed and I can tell he really wanted us to be at the table. We priced our last deal to him about 4 weeks ago and I believe the gas curve was higher than it is currently. Ronnie agrees that it would be worthwhile to reprice our deal since the prices were so close before. He said Jackson has   now joined Walton, Colquitt, and Satilla and they would like to come to terms on a definitive document in the December/January timeframe.   I talked with him about Oglethorpe and Tom Smith, and he was very interested to find out we'd been meeting with them. He thinks Oglethorpe will only keep about 40% of the existing Oglethorpe load. He'd like to sit down and talk thru all this after we re-price our deal and I told him that Ozzie would be in touch to try and set up a time. Although I hadn't really planned to call Ronnie on this, I thought it probably wouldn't be bad to stir things up a bit!\n"

We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA negotiations that could take about six months to finish.   Until the PPA is signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed with or without this specific turbine.   Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.   However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron   affiliate if there is a bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.If Delaney has a firm \"bird in the hand\" he should take the turbine.   Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want to take the turbine.My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.Rick   \n"

SDG&amp;E claims that the Calif ISO and the Calif PX are \"fundamentally flawed and inherently incapable of producing workable competition\".EPMI is directly impacted by this Complaint.   Even though FERC has approved EPMI's Market-Based Rate certificate after a finding that we had no market power, this Complaint would restrict us from selling at above $250 per MWh into the Calif ISO and Calif PX.Government Affairs is responding in two ways ---1. A direct response from EPMI to FERC responding that there has been no finding that EPMI has market power and therefore we should not lose our market-based rate authority.2. A response through WPTF (Western Power Trading Forum) and EPSA to argue more broadly the facts of what is going on in California (bad hedging by SDG&amp;E) and poor market structure rules.The fundamental problem is that the FERC is running scared about price spikes and may, without any real thinking, approve such a Complaint.   SDG&amp;E has asked for expedited treatment and a decision could be out as early as mid August.This issue again highlights how important the on-going FERC Investigation in Market Issues is for Enron.   We are putting together a detailed plan of how Enron will present our recommendations to FERC in this Investigation and will discuss this with you.Call with questions.   Thanks,Jim\n"

I propose to do this.   I understand the strength of the contractual issues on each of these projects and I think I can close out the issues by optimizing the Enron leverage in one global settlement.

We would like to recognise these people now (subject to top 2 PRC performance) by granting them some options.- As a consequence of some people's increased responsibilities and in looking at their unvested equity value, a number of people appear low in relation to the market.I would anticipate that the individual awards would be of 7 year options with standard vesting and would mainly be of individual 5-10,000 options awards (or $145-$290k). These might total in the region of 150-250,000 options.While most of the probable recipients will be commercial officers, I would expect a number of senior support and some Commercial Directors also to be recommended.Obviously I understand that we will need to put individual cases together for each recipient for board submission but I would appreciate your help and guidance as we proceed. In particular please alert me asap if you think this will be a problem.ThanksDavid\n"

I produced this list based on recommendations from our lobbying firm, Stokes Bartholomew, in Nashville.In 1999, Stokes Bartholomew, working with Jordan Mintz in Enron's tax department, convinced the state legislature to pass legislation clarifying that Enron's power plants would be exempt from the gross receipts tax.   Had we not succeeded in the effort, we would have had to pay gross receipts taxes of approximately $1.5 million per year.   In 2000, Tennessee is one of the only states in the union that has been running a deficit in the general revenue fund.   Rather than going home for the summer, the legislature stayed in session and debated among themselves and with the Governor on how to solve the revenue shortfall issue.   Eventually, they adopted unreasonably   optimistic revenue projections to produce a balanced budget (on paper).   This has not solved the problem because the state is already $1000 million below revenue projections in the first quarter of the fiscal year.   The legislature will look for a long term solution when it returns in January.   Stokes Bartholomew informs me that all sources of revenue will be considered - this means our exemption from the gross receipts tax could possibly be repealed.   At this time, no one is singling this exemption out, but Stokes Bartholomew is cautious and is monitoring the issue closely.Numerous legislators supported the gross receipts legislation for Enron.   If our gross receipts tax exemption is threatened next legislative session, we would have to return to these same legislators (if they are reelected) for support.   As long as Enron pays taxes in Tennessee, it behooves us to take an active interest in supporting those legislators who will defend our interests in the capitol.Since you are the key contacts at Enron for Tennessee, I ask you to assess this matter and decide whether ongoing legislative support is important to Enron's interests in TN and make contributions accordingly.I have recommended $9,5000 in contributions.   While this seems like a large amount, it is miniscule in comparison to the taxes we are not paying.   Moreover, it will go a long way to helping us protect our interests against those who would fight to have \"big corporations\", particularly out-of-state corporations, get stuck with additional tax burdens to solve the state's fiscal woes.You are probably asking why we are not using Enron PAC funds or coroporate funds to make these donations.   Tennessee law prohibits us from using corporate funds and limits the use of PAC funds to those PACs that do not receive any source of support from the corporation.   Because Enron Corp. pays the expenses for the Enron PAC, we are not permitted to contribute Enron PAC funds to candidates in Tennessee.   This is one of the most onerous political contribution laws in the country.If you have any questions I can be reached for the next week at 614.306.4359.

This list has been developed by our counsel/legislative agents in Nashville: Bill Bruce, Gif Thornton and Robert Gowan.Please feel free to call me to discuss further.   You can reach me on my cell phone this afternoon and all day tomorrow.   I will be in the office on Monday.Lieutenant Governor: Senator John Wilder (Democrat)$2,5000Represents Brownsville in the Senate.Sponsor of 1999 gross receipts tax exemption legislation for Brownsville.Has a serious opponent this November.The Senate elects the Lieutenant Governor who also serves as the head of the Senate.   It is in Enron's best interst that John Wilder win the election and be re-elected Lieutenant Governor. Rep. Jimmy Naifey$1,000Speaker of the HouseRepresents Brownsvile.Senate Candidate Larry Trail (Democrat)$2,000John Wilder's personal mission, besides his own election, is to get Larry elected to the Senate (it is an open seat that is being vacated by a Democrat).If the Democrats lose this seat there is a very good chance that Senator Wilder will not be re-elected Lieutenant Governor because the Democrats will have lost the majority in the Senate.Rep. Matt Kisber (Democrat)$1,5000Represents the Jackson area.Very pro-business Democrat.Is in a very tough race because the district was redrawn and it now majority Republican.Matt is the chair of the House Finance, Ways and Means Committee - which hears all gross receipts tax matters.Was very helpful to Enron on the gross receipts legislation.Senator Jerry Cooper$1,000Chair of the Senate Commerce CommitteeHis committee hears all legislation relating to energy and power plants.Rep. Shelby Rinehart$5000Chair of Commerce Committe (all energy and power plant issues) and powerful member of the House Finance and Ways and Means Committee.He is extremely powerful.

We are focused on selling our interests in the Calvert City, Ky. site now that we've successfully transferred the AES sale from Calvert City to Haywood. We have two counterparties that have shown a high degree of interest in Calvert City: Duke and Cleco. There are no issues surrounding Cleco but there may be with Duke from the following standpoint: our Calvert City site is ahead of Duke's Calvert City site in the interconnect que. Apparently, TVA erroneously did not factor in our interconnect application into their facilities study for Duke, and gave Duke an indication that there should not be material transmission upgrade costs for their plant interconnect. As both TVA and Duke now realize, our interconnect status does present a problem for Duke (and therefore TVA). We plan to talk with Duke in parallel with Cleco and I anticipate Duke then confronting TVA with the situation. I want to ensure our discussions with TVA and Duke over the next few weeks don't jeopardize our settlement with TVA. Will this settlement be closed by mid-January (thought that's what I heard)? Let me know your thoughts. Thanks. \n"

My understanding with respect to coverage of Canadian Industrials is as follows:1.) ENA to take lead on industrials that have facilities in both US and Canada and will co-ordinate coverage with ECC with respect to Canadian Facilities.2.) ECC to take lead on industrials that have Canadian Facilities only.3.) With respect to Canadian Pulp &amp; Paper Industrials, ENA will cover Pulp &amp; Paper Swaps and SPV structuring.   ECC will cover these industrials for all other Enron products (i.e. power, gas, services, etc.) Again, coverage needs to be co-ordinated.Specific to Tembec, I share Paul's concerns on why ENA would send 2 people to talk to Tembec re: outsourcing when Tembec is across the hall from ECC, ECC has an established relationship, and Tembec is a Canadian Company with no US facilities.It is my hope that we can resolve this amongst ourselves without having to get Dalainey involved. I would suggest a conference call next week.   In the interim, Paul will forward a CA to Tembec in contemplation of an outsourcing arrangement.Regards,Angela McCulloch for   Rob MilnthorpAssistant to Rob Milnthorp(403) 974-6738---",

While the meeting went well, I am very confused about the Enron team making the pitch to them.   My understanding is that the Canadian originators - particularly the Toronto team for Eastern Canadian companies will be responsible for everything except for pulp and paper swaps and to some extent, new SPV's.In this instance,1.   Tembec is a Canadian Company2.   All their assets are in Canada3.   Jan has been working with Tembec people in their largest facility4.   We know the executive team at Tembec5.   We clearly are very knowleadgable in all aspects of the Ontario energy market which is their focus right now6.   We understand and are pitching the overall energy outsourcing arrangement similar to the US pitchesWith this in mind, I am not sure why Kellie Metcalf and Bob Anderson flew up here (6 hours flight time there and back, $4,000 to $5,000 in flights and hotels) for a 4 hour meeting with Tembec.   Kelly was quite vocal in saying that this is a client they want to serve out of Houston.   I have stated to her that that does not make any sense in terms of efficiency and costs and knowledge of the market where Tembec's assets are.   Obviously, much of the technical engineering work would and should be done by the engineering team put together in the Industrial Services Group should a deal be struck.   However, the commercial negotiations and marketing should be led by this office!!!I thought this had been agreed to already.   We managed to piece up the meeting and deliver the \"Enron\" message, but going forward we need to have this resolved.Cheers, Paul D\n"

      "body": "\nGuys, to end all arguments, I would suggest the following protocol which is similar to what was discussed at Columbia Lakes: a) P&amp;P swaps and anything to do with the network strategy/assets in the paper sector in Canada and Mexico - Industrial Origination; b) Pure energy commodity positions and stand-alone energy assets (no outsourcing) for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - ECC or Enron Mexico;   c) Energy outsourcing for all industrial segments in Canada and Mexico - I would like Enron Canada and Enron Mexico to develop a written target list in which ECC, Enron Mexico and the Industrial Origination groups would work together to develop, sell and execute on the most profitable and value adding outsourcing product for the industrial customer in Canada and Mexico - ECC and Enron Mexico's understanding of the energy markets in Canada and Mexico coupled with the customer facing, product development and execution skills in Houston should provide a winning team.   I am asking for the three teams to clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer (ASAP).   I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.   Either way, I am expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for Canada and Mexico; and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to ECC.RegardsDelainey ---"

As I indicated in my e-mail, my career interest, and my view of the needs of the Toronto office, is for a role that would look more like cash trading/services transaction management rather than pure coverage.   Paul and I agree that there is not enough happening in the cash trading/services area right now to warrant my move to Toronto.   We are hopeful that at some point within the next year, this will not be the case and Garrett Tripp will find himself too busy to effectively manage what needs to be done.   This probably will occur soon after market opening, rather than before.   At that time, I could be ready to go quickly.   If market conditions change so that my skills are not a real good fit, than we would not make the move.   I am confident I can stay abreast of Ontario market issues from Portland to limit any learning curve once a move happens.I think Paul is comfortable with this plan.   He was going to run it by Rob.

I would be happy to meet with you and let you know in more detail what I have been working on, but here is a quick synopsis.We are putting new transportation products out on EOL---this should be ready for December business (assuming Lavo has no objections---I just sent him the information on the product).   They are simple products with no computerized interaction between EOL and Sitara or EOL and the pipeline bulletin boards (which we are still required to post through per the pipeline tariffs).   Quite honestly, I have no idea how much activity these will generate since each product still has the potential for being \"biddable\" on the pipeline EBBs and there is not an easy solution around that.   Also, all completed transactions still must be posted on the EBBs and confirmed by the pipelines before the deal is actually completed.   This product does not make the release process any simpler; however, it does make it more visible by having bids and offers out on EOL, where people are more likely to be looking than the pipeline EBB.The vision is to have the entire bidding and confirmation process through the EBBs automated, which would encourage a significant increase in trading activity for transportation, but there are several important infrastructure steps we must take first---you know, minor things like creating a transportation position screen in Sitara and getting the pipelines' EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) mechanisms in working form.   We are in testing with 9 pipelines as of today.Also, as I'm sure you are aware, Julie Gomez is working with several pipelines to put their available IT (interruptible) space out on EOL (the last I heard this should happen for January business), and then I understand that she plans to work with EOL to allow third parties to put transportation bids and/or offers out on EOL in an \"Altra-like\" system---meaning ENA will not always be a party to those transactions.   There are many changes occurring because of Order 637, but the pipelines are still going through their compliance filings and there are alot of complaints about those filings---which just means more time for implementation.If you have any questions, please call me at x355514.\n"

However, I think we have to ensure that we have rules and procedures accepted by the FERC that will allow the market to work.Jim, can you ensure that Colleen and Julie have the regulatory support needed to ensure that the market gets set up appropriately.Thanks.RegardsDelainey---"

At the same time, DLJ is bringing in some of the industry players that originally expressed interest.   One of those parties that called Jake is Orion, so Jake let Don Miller know this.   We will have a handle on preliminary feedback from these parties on Friday.   Pastoria and LVCogen:   Deal books should have arrived.   Do you want to meet on these?   who would you like to meet with?   Parquet for Pastoria and Gilbert/Clark for LVCogen?   Pastoria DASH is being finalized along with the Catalytica DASH.   Pastoria costs will be higher given the unwind of the Xonon swap and the fact that turbine costs were padded by $9MM for GE's catalytica development costs (argument for a value-grab!)FYI I called Patrick Stevens of Triumph Energy three times...the number I called appeared to be an office shared with other companies.   The general number's voicemail was full so I have not reached him.Scott Healy changed his decision and is going to work for Duran.

        " David W Delainey/HOU/ECT on 111/20/2000 111:31 AM ---Christopher F Calger111/19/2000 01:35 PMTo: David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Update on Pastoria and Las Vegas SaleDave,We made good progress last week on the sale of Pastoria and Las Vegas.   Kelemen is doing a great job.In general, Calpine is more agressive and can move quicker than AES - AES has one small team on both deals and is slower at turning docs.   Without giving up any rights or discouraging AES from pursuing Pastoria, we are trying to position AES on LV and keep Calpine's value for Pastoria close to their original bid.Calpine - PastoriaEarly in the week, Calpine clawed back about $12 million from their bid primarily by claiming that the turbine contract is overpriced by $10 million, and their bid assumed   \"market\" for the turbines.   While they are correct (the extra $10 million for Catalytica), we have gotten most of that back.   There bid now is $37MM (vs. $41) plus up to $5MM if the contingency is not used between signing and closing.   Calpine also wanted to include other permits (other than CEC) as conditions precedent and they wanted us to rep that the scheduled permits are the only ones required to construct and operate.   This is far too onerous and we are pushing back on this.   Our plan is to get a PSA that only has HSR and CEC permit as conditions precedent.   The other negotiating item is with respect to mechanics of continuing the development between signing and closing, and who pays for it and who is at risk.   This is relevant if you think of the scenario where incremental costs are necessary in order to get the Non-appealable CEC Permit.   AES - PastoriaSame PSA issues as above, but AES seems more skiddish about the development risks (other than CEC).   They want to change some of the EPC contract terms, they want a more-involved transition team and   they want us to take more risk on post-signing/pre-closing development.   Their bid was $27million plus upside for the 250MW expansion and a services agreement for fuel supply and schedule coordination services.   We have given them term sheets that provide for an extra $10 million for the 250MW expansion and approximately $750,000 per year of risk-free service revenues.   They have not yet responded.   By contrast, Calpine does not want to use NEPCO, and they dont want our services or any material ongoing involvement (cleaner).   CEC Process:On Thursday night we received the Presiding Members Proposed Decision (PMPD), recommending approval of the Project.   By statute, this is one month early and the quickest in California to date.   This is a 4000 page document and we are combing through it to determine any material changes from our original filing and the original staff assessment - none detected yet.   The stated process is that we would receive our CEC permit on December 20, after which their is a 30 day appeal period.   If there is no appeal, the process is done Jan 19.   For purposes of handicapping the risk, we have already gone through the public hearing process.   While there was some intervention, our remote site is not in the environmental/NIMBY crosshairs like other projects.   In order for the appeal process to derail the timing, someone needs to show that (i) a law was broken or (ii) the CEC analysis is seriously flawed.   In the past two years five plants were approved and only one was appealed - this was due to a resident that was not notified and therefore the project broke the law.   This caused a 4 month delay.   The two bidders will not take the risk on the CEC permit getting appealed.   In Calpine's words, it would look pretty bad on Wall Street if they had to write off a $40MM development fee paid to Enron for nothing! AES-Las VegasThey seem genuinely interested in the asset - more the expansion than the QF.   They like LM6000's and think they are great resource for the location.   We told them they are behind the other bidders both on time and value.   They have reviewed the EPC contract and understand the quality of the LD's, liability limits and the consortium EPC group.   They indicated that they have no problem with getting incremental insurance in order to protect the value of hitting June, 20002.   They want to meet with the EPC group and provide input to the notice to proceed.   Closing for them on this deal is a little cleaner than Pastoria because we have the permits in hand, and it is not as big a bet (smaller asset, existing operation, less political risk, etc.).   Our plan is to turn the PSA one more time (Monday) and then tell them that if they get their bid up a few million ($26MM to say $30MM), we will focus on them for a week or so to try to get it closed.   Deal Timing - Pastoria: Firm up Calpine on value and risk allocation during the next week and aim for signing and HSR filing on December 1.   Sometime before December 1 we need to finalize our plans with respect to earnings recognition.   We have been talking with Deffner, Westfall and lawyers about different structures involving either (i) LJM; (ii) AIG; or (ii) selling to Calpine with liquidated damages relating to CEC Permit.   As you can imagine, there are pros and cons to each approach.   We expect to know more on this by Wednesday of this week and will update you at that time.Deal Timing - Las Vegas: The only condition precedent should be the HSR.   If they can move quicker, we will target December 1 to sign and late Dec to close.   The urgency relates to schedule - the longer we wait, the greater the risk of missing June 20002 COD.   With respect to QIV earnings, AES' bid results in a $6MM hit.   Signing the deal to sell reduces fair market valuation.   Two possibilities we are exploring: If AES increases its bid, the hit may be neglibible; alternatively we may be able to discount the LM6000's being sold to them, which may not show up as a hit since the LM6000 pool is accrual and being sold into Turbopark.   Like the Pastoria analysis, we will know more this week and will update you when we know.   Regards,Chris \n"
      ],
      "body": "\nChris, sounds good - a) Wes will work with you on earnings recognition issues for Pastoria and b) selling the LM's and the LV Cogen asset is a good call regardless of the hit.   Some accounting flexibility on the LV hit may be worthwhile.   Value protected counts just as much as new value created - you are doing the right thing.RegardsDelainey---"

See questions/points below.1)   Izzo has claimed that you (Delainey) has agreed to pay EE&amp;CC for construction services in the form of Westinghouse LD payments.   Is this correct?2)   I am concerned that EE&amp;CC will settle for cash payment from Westihnghouse (Heat Rate &amp; Schedule penalties) rather than increased output.3)   Given a sale at $450/kW, increased output is worth $5 million vs. the $1-2 million we would collect for schedule and Heat Rate LD's.4)   My recommendation is to trade the HR and schedule shortfall for increased output at Gleason to maximize total Enron profitability.From ENA's perspective we should collect the schedule penalty at Wheatland only and insist on the 12 MW additional output at Gleason.   This combination provides the best value to Enron.If Izzo's form of payment for the construction jobs is Westinghouse LD's, then he will be motivated to recieve cash payment.   Please provide me the necessary feedback to ensure that we do the right thing for Enron.Thanks Dave.\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nKevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.   Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 90 degrees at site.   Likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 90 degree output.I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.   Given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really get.   Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities.   As well, given current accounting language, any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.RegardsDelainey---"

Wisconsin Electric started the ball rolling in September with plans to build two new 6000 megawatt coal-fired power plants, the first to be announced in the United States in several years. Richard Grigg, president of the Wisconsin Energy Corp.(WEC) unit, said the decision was a simple matter of prudence and a way to avoid putting all of your eggs in one basket. \"We believe that a strong diversity in your fuel mix is a very important part of having a reliable and low cost electricity supply,\" Grigg told Reuters in an interview. Although coal accounts for just over half of U.S. electricity production, the economic and environmental advantages of modern gas turbines had made the decision about how to fuel new power plants something of a no-brainer in recent years. Consequently, over 90 percent of new plants currently planned in the United States are slated to burn natural gas. But as natural gas prices soar, hitting all-time highs of over $9 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange this week, Grigg suspects that other power producers will also take another look at coal. \"Given increasing gas prices and concern for supply availability, I think you're going to see more people look for ways to utilize coal,\" Grigg said. BACK IN THE PICTURE Griff Jones, vice-president of power trading at Dynegy Inc. (DYN), said high natural gas prices and recent advances in clean combustion technology had put coal back in the picture. \"A year or two ago people wouldn't bring up the subject of developing a coal plant. Today there's talk about it,\" he said. For Dynegy, which began as a natural gas marketer and has made the convergence of the natural gas and electric power businesses an article of faith, that is quite an admission. Since the oil price explosions of the 1970s, the share of oil used in U.S. power generation has dwindled to around 3 percent. Nuclear plants deliver about 20 percent of the nation's electricity but construction of new nuclear plants is widely viewed as politically impossible following the accidents at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 1986. Natural gas currently supplies about 15 percent of U.S. electricity but is projected to gain market share steadily due to power generators' enthusiasm for the high efficiency and low emissions of the latest \"combined-cycle\" gas turbines. Oil and gas industry executives often cite projected growth in U.S. demand for natural gas of 30 trillion cubic feet by 2010, much of it fueled by increased use of gas for power generation. Plans for new gas-fired power plants are based on the assumption that the industry will be able to step up to the plate and deliver ever-increasing amounts of gas. FLAT GAS PRODUCTION In recent years, however, U.S. natural gas production has remained stubbornly steady around 19 billion cubic feet, augmented by Canadian imports of around 3 billion cubic feet. The recent surge in gas prices has pushed the number of drilling rigs currently searching for gas in the United States to unprecedented levels of over 8000 from just over 6000 a year ago. But so far, at least, production remains more or less flat as gas producers fight the accelerating depletion of mature fields. Plans for a pipeline that would tap huge unexploited gas reserves in Alaska will alleviate the supply situation, but the gas would only start flowing in the second half of this decade. Coal, on the other hand, is abundant and readily available: the United States has reserves equivalent to well over 2000 years of domestic consumption. Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, estimated in a recent report that the United States will need 3000,000-4000,000 megawatts of new electricity generating capacity over the next decade, or somewhere between 8000 and 1,000 new plants. Natural gas producers would be hard pressed to supply enough fuel for even half of that new capacity, he calculated. \"Therefore, we think it likely that new coal-fired generating capacity will also be necessary to meet demand growth,\" Niles wrote. \"We see no alternative fuel capable of producing the necessary power, due to political and time constraints.\" Wisconsin Electric's Grigg said it might not be long before other power generators followed his own company's lead and drew up plans for new coal-fired plants. \"I have heard some rumblings from others that are also recognizing that economics as well as supply issues are starting to look more favorable for coal,\" he said. , 2000 Reuters \n"

June 14th, 3-4PM.   Attending on Enron Wind's behalf will be Kurt Huneke and Adam Umanoff (MD, Commercial Americas)In the last two months Enron completed the acquisition of the minority shares (~20%) in Enron Wind Corp.   As a result of this decision, Enron has also made a variety of changes in Enron Wind as a first step to maximizing our return in this industry.One of the very next steps we are taking is an effort to reacquaint the various operating subsidiaries with Enron Wind.   As the regulatory environment evolves in North America a number of new opportunities are evolving which should benefit ENA as a result of Enron's market position.We thought it might be useful if John Lavorato, Janet Dietrich and Kevin Presto were available to join us as well.   Please feel free to invite anyone else you feel would be appropriate.   As you may know, we have begun to discuss some of these opportunities with EPMI and we are encouraged by the way we see the market developing.Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this meeting.Thank you,Michael PayneDirectorEnron Wind6-9690\n"
