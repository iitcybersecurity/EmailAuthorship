An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe called me yesterday.   He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he can have the wire to us before year end.   If he doesn't get the invoice today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.   Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the invoice will be faxed over to him.Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.   Merry Christmas!Darla\n"

Slocum and the Texas A&amp;M Aggies are&lt; demanding a recount of the game in which Oklahoma&lt; won 35 to 31. \"The end zones were confusing,\" says Slocum. \"I'm sure that&lt; some of the touchdowns that went in Oklahoma's end zone were meant to go&lt; into ours. We were scoring in those end zones also.   Oklahoma would never&lt; have scored thirty-five points. There's no way we lost this one. A&amp;M&lt; demands&lt; a recount.\"&lt;&lt; Oklahoma officials are calling this \"outrageous\".   \"They agreed to the&lt; size,&lt; shape and locations of the end zones prior to kick-off,\" replies OU coach&lt; Bob Stoops.   \"If they had a problem with them, they should have said so&lt; before we started. You don't get to keep playing until you're happy with&lt; the&lt; outcome. Someone had to lose. We've scored over thirty-five points many&lt; times.\"&lt;&lt; A&amp;M has sent lawyers, farmers, and those guys in the funny boots as well&lt; as&lt; Reville down to Kyle Field, where the scoreboard will be tested.&lt; \"We&lt; are confident that when the points are re-totaled, we will be the winner&lt; of&lt; the game,\" says Slocum.&lt;&lt; OU also points out that in many games prior to this one, the same end&lt; zones&lt; were used. \"They didn't have a problem with the end&lt; zones until they lost,\" says Stoops.&lt;&lt; Outside of Kyle Field, A&amp;M student protesters have gathered bearing signs&lt; such as, \"A&amp;M wants a fair game!&lt; WHOOP!\"   Students' thoughts echoed their signs. \"All we want is afair&lt; total of the points before we declare a winner,\" says student Karen Hays,&lt; an&lt; Aggie from Marfa. \"We need to proceed cautiously and not rush to judgment&lt; before we declare a winner.\"&lt;&lt; ABC, around 2:000pm central time, had mistakenly declared A&amp;M the winner,&lt; despite the slim 3 point lead the Aggies held at&lt; that point. At about 2:30 pm, with the game still to close to call, ABC&lt; had&lt; to back off its prediction.&lt;&lt; College Football analyst Brent Musburger made the call. \"We felt thatwith&lt; a&lt; number of points still not added in by Jamaar Tombs&lt; and the Aggies, we were certain A&amp;M would carry this game. We may have&lt; been&lt; premature in our prediction.\"\n"

We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 deadline.   Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 7000,000 Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.   The project calls for about 59 miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of about $94,343,7000.As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for authority to charge negotiated rates.   Petal also requested approval of certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of our intervention.   The certificate application is 635 pages, not including another 7778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.\n"

Let me know how much you wouldplan to nominate at this point, etc.   And can they committ to a certain,volume, etc.   Also,   have they talked to HPL about taking gas at thispoint.After visiting the site (M&amp;R 718886/768886), I found the following work thatwould need to be done before custody transfer measurement could beperformed : (The site has two 12\" meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)1. All valves will need to be inspected &amp; overhauled   A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for thiswork)   B. Control valves - inspected &amp; overhauled (needs to be sent off forthis work)   C. Small regulators overhauled2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected   A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled   B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fittingoverhauled and tubes honed)3. All transmitter need to be replaced   A. Differential - 2   B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)   C. Pressure - 4   D. Direct mount manifolds - 2   E. UPS system4. RTU boards need to be furnished   A. Mother board   B. STI REM   C. Main terminal board   D. Serial IO LEM   E. Analog Output board5. New batteries ( 4 @ $ 160)6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50\" increments through Beta range)It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls andassociated valves, meter runs, and EGM.

This will be passed on to Ormet.Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.   If this IT is cut, we still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or on Cypress.   Ormet pays all additional transport costs.Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly balancing at any point during the contract term.I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).   If you have any preferences for alternate delivery points, please let me know.As I mentioned, we   have already quoted NYMEX + .0555 as the all-in delivered price to Ormet.Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).   They are one hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.Thank you for all of your help on this deal.Craig   \n"

As a fall back position, National Fuel will seek guidance from FERC as to whether it should be made into a new service.   To make PA OCA happy, David Reitz indicated that any future proposal will incorporate the 50-50 sharing that is in the current proposal.National Fuel plans to make a revised pro forma tariff filing in mid-January and inform FERC that this filing resulted from the collaborative effort of parties to the proceeding.   The filing will have reservation of rights language that preserves National Fuel's right to file something completely different when it files to place the revised tariff sheets into effect.   Prior to making the filing, National Fuel will circulate the explanatory transmittal letter and pro forma tariff sheets, and will flag any changes made to the pro forma tariff sheets.   This pre-filing circulation should occur some time during the first two weeks in January.Nothing was said about the intra-day recall provisions.&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;Rebecca.W.Cantrell@enron.com&lt; 12/18/000 03:39PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Yes, please.
