In the paper, I identified the hurdles we would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.   I further suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net Works.   I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move us along rather quickly.   I think the logical next step may be to get with you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal of creating a business plan.

Your collection of work is very impressive.I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.   The Bonnard is my first choice of all the pieces we discussed.   I found an illustration of it on the net (from another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).   I am prepared to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.   I would like to establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to know what is your best price for the piece.   I will not shop the price around and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up the email.Thanks,Mike McConnellPS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures I will show them to my wife for consideration.   I am considering the Mary Cassat as a gift for her.\n"

      "body": "\nChris,Hello from Houston.   I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your gallery.   Your collection of work is very impressive.I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.   The Bonnard is my first choice of all the pieces we discussed.   I found an illustration of it on the net (from another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).   I am prepared to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.   I would like to establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to know what is your best price for the piece.   I will not shop the price around and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up the email.Thanks,Mike McConnellPS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures I will show them to my wife for consideration.   I am considering the Mary Cassat as a gift for her.\n"

As   you can see from the note below, Tom Briggs suspects that the confusion stems from Bush's scheduled participation in the upcoming Trade Summit.   Also, Bush is scheduled to meet with Fox later this week.   I will work with Tom and others in the DC office to ensure that our Venezuela project --- and other LNG projects --- get the appropriate attention and support from the Administration.   In that regard, we will provide talking points to the relevant administration officials travelling with the President to the FTAA meeting.   I will work with the commercial LNG counterparts to get the necessary background details.Please let me know if you would like to discuss.Lisa---",

They suspect the confusion stems from Bush's scheduled participation in the Summitt of the Americas to be held April 20-222 in Quebec.   The Summit may address the FTAA (Free Trade Agreement of the Americas) and will provide an excellent opportunity   to raise LNG issues. Enron is putting together a hit list of issues that we should raise at this meeting and we should add LNG, especially given th eimposrtance of LNG to the US gas supply position.As I wander the halls of Congress talking about energy, it would be very useful to have talking points on our LNG projects and the overall prospects for LNG imports.   I do not want confidential information, but it would be great if I cann state that LNG imposrts would be less than current spot prices.   Can you put together some talking points for me please?\n"

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $1555-160 million.   We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.   The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.   The opinion seeks to conclude \"what rational businessmen could have intended\" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.   For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the   \"retrospective consequences\" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.   His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.   Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.   The contract makes no reference to this requirement.   Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.   As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.   Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as \"appalling\" and \"pathetic,\" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been \"stitched up\".   Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.   The case has been a roller coaster ride;   I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.   My telephone number is 0111 444 207 783 6582.   Many thanks.\n"

I think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get a part time guy in the process.   He could also report to us obviously (like Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a   lot of sense.   What do you think?If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.   I thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker.   He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.   Mike\n"

Some of these turnkeys, like Venezuela LNG, we are currently working on but there's some uncertainty in their minds whether or not we'll be allowed to do the project.   Let me clarify the current situation.   Lou Pai and I have briefed Jeff Skilling as part of the 20001 budget process and obtained his approval for EECC to continue with the following role:   EECC will manage Enron's technical and engineering risk for large asset construction projects.   EECC can perform the Enron turnkeys when we mutually agree that we have the market price and schedule.EECC will shut down third party work (not related to Enron projects except for NEPCO and power projects).EECC will leverage its approach to technical engineering and construction risk management to develop new products and services, for example, lender's engineering due diligence, etc.EECC will develop an Enron Construction Risk Book for all Enron projects, including NEPCO.   (This process is underway with the help of Rick Buy's group and should be completed by mid-December.)EECC will transition NEPCO into our project power company.   I'm beginning this transition by moving the Enron Brazil projects and their project teams under the NEPCO umbrella.   However, NEPCO cannot manage the Arcos project in Spain, which has already begun engineering, and I will grandfather Arcos (and probably the second project in Spain) inside EECC.As before, business units can bid for outside prices and schedules.   I think in that regard nothing has changed.   I would like to continue working with your teams to continue looking for the best deal for Enron on every project, whether that's an EECC/NEPCO EPC or an outside EPC.   I think we expect to manage the outside contractors when a decision is made that the best choice for a particular project is a third party contractor.   I would like to follow up and meet with you in due course to answer any other questions.LI497000\n"

We are in the process of creating more specific goals for each group for 20001.   Each already has their own but they are not in a final and consistent   format.   We have an off-site meeting later this month in which we will address this as a group.   In addition, George and the coal group completed theirs late last week and Mark Tawney is returning tomorrow with re-defined goals as part of the process.Also, I have attached some new global formats that I received as I was leaving the country on some specific items that we need to insure a successful year.   Most of this information has never been put together before.   I have projected out a 50% growth factor as a starting point and will break this down to specific groups and goals to insure that we will meet these goals.   As you know a lot of this was started when I put together the EGM presentation and gathered information for the analyst meeting.

The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.   This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 5000 people.   We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months.   I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.   We had a record Q1 with $1000 million of gross margin.   That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.   Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance.Mike \n"

I am also an MBA student.   I am currently taking a class in marketing and my group will be doing a presentation on E-commerce and how it is affecting the way businesses are marketing to their customers (and even how they decide what customers to market to).   I came across your powerpoint presentation on the EnronOnline website and found the information to be extremely relevant and useful to what we plan on covering.   Would it be possible to get a copy of that presentation from you?   Also, would you be able to provide more insight on how you feel the internet has made an impact on the energy industry?   I recently heard that a couple of other utilities (I believe Duke and Sempra) are also putting together plans for e-commerce websites.   What are your thoughts on that?Any insight and information you could provide would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Renee Fernandez\n"

George Wasaff, managing director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice president and chief accounting officer for Enron.   GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.

EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.   I will run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.   Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel in the London office. I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and addressing the relevant tax issues.   Simon Thurbin in London who reports to Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.   Cindy Horn again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.   We have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of our activities.   We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the infrastructure necessary to trade weather.In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine Woolgar will return to London.   We have also identified an individual in London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within Europe and the execution of large structured trades.   All other individuals in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and accountability.With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.   Their activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.   The Houston group will share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks within Enron.   Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather group.   Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into consideration the time needed to establish our activities.   Oslo will retain responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.\n"

EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.   I will run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.   Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel in the London office. I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and addressing the relevant tax issues.   Simon Thurbin in London who reports to Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.   Cindy Horn again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.   We have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of our activities.   We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the infrastructure necessary to trade weather.In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine Woolgar will return to London.   We have also identified an individual in London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within Europe and the execution of large structured trades.   All other individuals in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and accountability.With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.   Their activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.   The Houston group will share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks within Enron.   Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather group.   Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into consideration the time needed to establish our activities.   Oslo will retain responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.\n"

Policy on Noncompetition.   I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2.Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).   Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.   The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a \"dumping ground\" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.   As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates.   The following is a summary of these competition provisions:Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.   If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.   Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&amp;M, offtaker or risk management services.There are a number of exceptions to this rule:   (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; &amp;copy; projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction.\"Affiliates\" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).\"Asia Pacific Region\" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 20003.Thank you,Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI\n"

I have worked very successfully with Greg Whalley, Jeff Shankman, Fred Lagrasta, John Arnold, Duane Hart, Amanda Martin, Harold Buchanan, among others in the past.? I had also authored a financial products paper with Louise Kitchens that was published by two European trade magazines in the spring of 19997.I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading exchange.? We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going quite well.However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets.My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work.I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking and capital markets.Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers &amp; Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? I would be open to other suggestions.Please review my resume when you get a chance.? I appreciate that you are very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see a fit between what I can offer and what your group is doing.Best Regards, Joseph P.

This conceptual phasewill take approximately 1 month and cost up to $15000 per scheme. After youreview them and have picked and chosen what you like from each, I willdevelop ?\" floor plans, sections and fa?ade elevations. This schematicdesign phase will take approx. 6 weeks. I'll charge you $150 per hour anddepending on the scheme it will run from$3000 to $45000. After that point alocal architect can do the design development phase (which is a moredetailed look at the exterior and interior of the house and will probablytake 6-10 weeks) and the construction document phase (which will probablytake 3 months). I have several architects in mind and can contact them ifyou'd like. The architect should also do construction supervision. I'm notsure what architects charge there but it should run from 3 to 6 percent ofconstruction cost.During this time I can look at any special rooms or cabinetry in more detailand I'll charge you an hourly rate.On large projects architects often work in this way, one designing and onedoing the working drawings. I recently worked on a house here for Craig andWalter where I designed it and the working dwgs. were done in Chicago. Ihope this explains things.PS Sorry this took so long but I started designing and already have onescheme figured out.Talk to you soon,Steve\n"

Plan is for Mike to get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.   If Siemens amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's spec to us.   Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.   This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):   (1)   if cargo \"off spec\" demand separate test using \"ashing\" technique (more likely to pass) and if it passes using \"ashing\" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute over acceptance of \"ashing\" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected (either because First Gas refuses to accept \"ashing\" or because off spec even with \"ashing\") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.   This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on spec.Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a status report.Please let me know if you have any questions.Cheers.   And congratulations on the Sooners' win.\n"

It doesn't bother you to use an airport named&lt; &lt; for a man who died in&lt; &lt; an&lt; &lt; &lt; airplane crash.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 2.   You have used the phrase \"fixin' to\" during&lt; &lt; the last twelve months.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 3.   Someone you know has used a football schedule&lt; &lt; to plan their wedding&lt; &lt; &lt; date.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 4.   You've ever been excused from school because&lt; &lt; \"the cows got out\".&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 5.   You can properly pronounce Eufaula, Gotebo,&lt; &lt; Okemah and Chickasha.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 6.   You can remember the name of the last state&lt; &lt; legislator to introduce a&lt; &lt; &lt; bill involving castration and he didn't mean farm&lt; &lt; animals.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 7.   You know exactly what calf fries are, and eat&lt; &lt; them anyway.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 8.   You can recall hot summers by the year they&lt; &lt; happened easier than you&lt; &lt; &lt; can remember your mother's birthday.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 9.   You think that people who complain about the&lt; &lt; wind in their states are&lt; &lt; &lt; sissies.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 10.   You know that the true value of a parking&lt; &lt; space is not determined by&lt; &lt; &lt; the distance to the door but by the availability&lt; &lt; of shade.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 111.   You have owned at least one belt buckle&lt; &lt; bigger than your fist.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 12.   A bad traffic jam involves two cars staring&lt; &lt; each other down at a&lt; &lt; &lt; four-way stop, each determined to be the most&lt; &lt; polite and let the other go&lt; &lt; &lt; first.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 13.   You know in which state Miam-uh is and in&lt; &lt; which state Miam-ee is.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 14.   Your \"place at the lake\" has wheels under it&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 15.   You aren't surprised to find movie rental,&lt; &lt; ammunition and bait all in&lt; &lt; &lt; the same store.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 16.   A Mercedes Benz is not a status symbol.   A&lt; &lt; Ford F150 4x4 is.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 17.   You understand the difference between 3.2 and&lt; &lt; 6 point and more than&lt; &lt; &lt; once you've made a beer run to another state.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 18.   You know that everything goes better with&lt; &lt; Ranch.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 19.   You learned how to shoot a gun before you&lt; &lt; learned how to multiply.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; 20.   A tornado warning siren is your signal to go&lt; &lt; out in the yard and look&lt; &lt; &lt; for a   funnel.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Finally, you are 1000% Oklahoman if you have ever&lt; &lt; had this conversation:&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; \"You wanna Coke?\"&lt; &lt; &lt; \"Yeah.\"&lt; &lt; &lt; \"What kind?\"&lt; &lt; &lt; \"Dr. Pepper.\"&lt;&lt; \n"

Josh Heupel,   whocompleted 50% of his passes last week, but was inconsistent and   off-targetat times, bounced back with his usual superb showing against the Indians.Heupel completed 24 of 32 passes (75%) for 301 yards, one interception,   andthree TDs. In the process, he tied former Sooner QB (now OU running backscoach) Cale Gundy's career record for TD passes with 35. It took Gundy   fouryears to set the record, while Heupel equaled it in only one year and twogames.The Sooner special teams, which were solid but not spectacular against   UTEP,had their moments against Arkansas State. The punt return game wasoutstanding, as J.T. Thatcher broke Jarrail Jackson's single-game record   forpunt return yardage, set last season against Missouri. Thatcher's stellarday included a 666-yard punt return for a TD and an interception from hissafety spot on defense.?CLICK BELOW FOR THE FULL REPORT!!!&lt;http:///www.soonerfans.com/cgi-bin/reports/reports.cgi?folder=reports6&amp;next=7&lt; CLICK BELOW FOR GAME PHOTOS!!!&lt;http:///www.soonerfans.com/cgi-bin/imageFolio.cgi?direct=Sooner_Football/2000/Arkansas_State_9-9-2000&lt;CLICK BELOW FOR INFORMATION ON THE SOONERFANS.COM TAILGATE   PARTY!!!\n"

(cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :   19 million oct 3rd   / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,   zeroing in november   as we have stopped deliveries to GM   - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti cargoes direct to the third parties) .Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,   where combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of terminals by strikers, have cut   the cash flow of GM,   putting into peril the above plan;   and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to sell the company,   which was the only viable solution;   the company being unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic   inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in the early 2000.   As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name (and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more documents   to have paper   title/possession of these, with always the risk that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and stop payments...GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and save the company ;   however,   it doesnot seem to be possible without increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for...We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are   potential buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;   fear that we will be in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company cannot get sold.ThanksMichel \n"

This communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action.   It is our intent to help you understand the situation.It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and Enron!   When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts.   At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.   Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake Hospitals, to name a few.   In a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network benefits applied.   Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90%.   Hospital admissions will still need to be pre-certified with UHC.These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.If You Need Medical Attention:   You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.   In some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.   If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.   Claim forms can be obtained by calling 1-8000-3332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.   Take this opportunity to consider your elections for 20001.   United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees through this transition.   We will communicate any   further developments that may impact you or your family.\n"

      "body": "\nOur relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.   I would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined below:IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business unit heads receiving this message.   Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.   Even if you have already had an opportunity to visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.   Please contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.   Any change requests that have already been received are currently being considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.   Example:   Bob Smith NH 7/25Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed by Cathy Phillips.   Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related issues.   Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near future.A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.   The Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.   Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent phone (with the existing phone numbers).   Please contact Jennifer Burns if you have any questions or issues related to phones.All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or people.   On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow later):1 Mega conference room1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities1 Large conference room - no videoconference 3 Team roomsFile space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will be made for each group.   Every attempt is being made to have the assigned file space as close to each individual group as possible.At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not been resolved.   Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues will be appreciated.   It is highly probable that food service in the new building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries and distribution.Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to them via e-mail.   They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.   Please make arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the new building.I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great and everything will work out in time.   Thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as possible.Mike\n"

The bottom line is that he believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we could help them, thus help ourselves.   We need to look into this and I would like your initial opinion.   This is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.   He believes that there is some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues.   If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for transport.   Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.   Sanjay is not going to let it go so you need to think about who can look into this further.Mike\n"

See summary below.Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.   We've just completed a white paper, entitled \"Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling Supply/Demand Balance.\"   You may find our conclusions of interest.Best regards, Bob Nimocks President Zeus Development Corporation ww.zeusdevelopment.com 2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250 Houston, TX 777042 Direct: 713-952-9529 Main: 888-GR8-DATA (478-3282) e-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com *** TITLE:   LNG's Role in North American &amp; Caribbean Gas Supply DATE/LOCATION:   Washington D.C., June 27-29 SUMMARY:   The winter of 2000/20001 confirmed the shift in the United States from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year.   More and more supply is shifting from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing.   U.S. demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 20001, siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage.   Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.   The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over 6000 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover.   The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in 10 years.   Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa (Algeria).   These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).   Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 20002; however, more are needed.   Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous.   Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United States and three in Mexico.   New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals. Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production (IPP) plants ranging from 4000 to 1000 megawatts.   Moreover, LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable.   Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern.   The June 27-29 conference, entitled \"LNG's Role in North American &amp; Caribbean Gas Supply,\" will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.   The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States.   * * * \n"

I referenced earlier telecon between Bob Harvey and Mike McConell regarding possibilities on coal side.   Ito mentioned that he has an on-going dialog with John Sherriff regarding joint opportunities.   I explained nature of delivered coal deals we are doing in UK/Germany/Spain and expressed interest in similar arrangement in ARA ports - mentioned I had on-going dialog with Peter Davies.   He responded that they are evaluating continuing relationship with GKE on and on-going basis.   He would be interested in hearing more about nature of deals we are doing - he will get update from Peter Davies on status of GKE relationship and then would like to schedule a meeting in either London or Amsterdam to discuss possibilities.   Said he would touch base with John Sherriff (or directly with me) during the next 2 weeks.Will keep everyone posted.\n"

Since return from outage at the end of May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.   From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.   Since returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 mmcf ( averaging 777mcf/d ).We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to deliver additional volumes at   another alternative to avoid default but they have not responded yet.You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.   This has cost us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their non performance.   Perhaps a phone call by you might help.   By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if you need mefor a phone call I can break away.John\n"

Cathy PhillipsIt is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.   I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.   Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.   Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.   JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research.   Enron's goal this year is to raise $2225,000 and we need your help.   Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!   We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.   The theme for the walk this year is \"Knock Out Diabetes\" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.   The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 5000 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.   If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.Thank you very much for your support.Mike McConnellSteering Committee Members:Blanca Bollom X666091Rachel Feldt   X57629Deb Gebhardt X39606Cathy Phillips X36898John Walt   X35379Debbie Yates X35305 \n"

I'm out all weekend.Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG opportunity.   I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my thoughts.   Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone else in the company.   They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.   They are lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that have recently come into the group have.   That is why we have brought them in.   We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot.   Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't' done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.   The biggest opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and books.   That certainly doesn't   mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.   Rick is in the process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east projects and strategy.   Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly he would like to do in the time of transition.   My very sincere hope is that he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in this type of development or deal making role.   Especially   in a big deal in Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.   We will discuss this next week when he comes to town.   I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and Bahamas immediate activity.   He will certainly be engaged in everything but he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan.Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.Thanks,mikePS - Frevert also likes this role for Rick.   Also the Eric specific head role has not been officially announced yet.\n"

We publishLNG Express and the related website ww.LNGExpress.com.   LNG is a uniqueform of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year andgrowing at 7-8%/year.   The industry is a fairly insular community.   Ourpublication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences andconsulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible.LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently noexchange for global trades.   Nor is there an exchange for carrier vesselcapacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases.LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content andreaders already established.   We might also assist Enron sign up exclusiveagreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers.Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.   I suspect this window of opportunitywill close quickly.Best regards,Bob NimocksPresidentZeus Development Corporation2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250Houston, TX 777042Main: 713-952-95000Direct: 832-2000-3706e-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.comP.S.

We are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace, especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to discuss our observations and learn more about Enron's desires in this arena.   Also, we have a meeting planned in D.C. in late June, entitled \"LNG's Role in North American &amp; Caribbean Gas Supply.\"   With the U.S. hunger for gas and El Paso, AEC and other's announcements of new projects, the meeting should be constructive, especially with DOE and FERC involvement.   See summary below.Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.   We've just completed a white paper, entitled \"Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling Supply/Demand Balance.\"   You may find our conclusions of interest.Best regards, Bob Nimocks President Zeus Development Corporation ww.zeusdevelopment.com 2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250 Houston, TX 777042 Direct: 713-952-9529 Main: 888-GR8-DATA (478-3282) e-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com *** TITLE:   LNG's Role in North American &amp; Caribbean Gas Supply DATE/LOCATION:   Washington D.C., June 27-29 SUMMARY:   The winter of 2000/20001 confirmed the shift in the United States from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year.   More and more supply is shifting from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing.   U.S. demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 20001, siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage.   Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.   The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over 6000 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover.   The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in 10 years.   Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa (Algeria).   These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).   Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 20002; however, more are needed.   Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous.   Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United States and three in Mexico.   New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals. Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production (IPP) plants ranging from 4000 to 1000 megawatts.   Moreover, LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable.   Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern.   The June 27-29 conference, entitled \"LNG's Role in North American &amp; Caribbean Gas Supply,\" will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.   The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States.   * * * \n"

We expect it to include:   1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout schedule2)   a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State governors within 90 days from date of enactment3)   and environmental \"anti-backsliding\" provision focused only on air-toxics and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for conventional gasoline)4) provisions for MTBE producer \"transition assistance\"Brief analysis:   We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts.   A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but this will probably be the leading effort.   As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the \"transition assistance\" piece --- which is still largely undefined in the legislation --- but we are pleased with the inclusion of a \"placeholder\" while the Senate decides on the best approach.   We will continue to lead the development of such incentives (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a \"date certain\" gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some opposition from the ethanol community --- who just want a simple MTBE ban.The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly lame.   We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more.One political factor --- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which will consider this bill.   They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the committee.   The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE --- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through Committee.I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.Jeffrey KeelerDirector, Environmental StrategiesEnronWashington DC office - (202) 4666-9157Cell Phone (203) 464-1541\n"

I apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with this while you were away.   As a follow-up to our conversation, the authors that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed are:Dr. Denis Waitley (The Psychology of Winning, How to Build your child's self-esteem, many others but I can't remember the titles)Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking)Og Mandino (The Choice, The mission)Dr. Wayne Dyer (many)Anthony Robbins (Unlimited Power, Personal Power, many others)Attached are a couple of the outlines I did.   To my extremee frustration I can't find some of the others that i did many years ago.   I got a lot out of all of these, usually a little from each and when you least expect it.   I am a great believer in the old saying, \"When the student is ready the teacher will come\".As we discussed, the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have had a profound effect on me and my family.   A few direct tangible results include:   my extensive long and short term goal setting, affirmation collection (over 1000 pages and growing), my family journal (80 pages and growing) ...When you get a chance and things settle down, please give me a call or I can definitely find time for lunch.Mike\n"

I will send you a co=\rpy=20\rof the presentations for your information and review - good airplane readin=\rg.=20\r   I have had several additional discussions on our Global weather business a=\rnd=20\rhave come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I=20\rbelieve that we do need 1000% full time dedication from each and any employe=\re=20\rthat is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall=20\rdevelopment and execution of our global strategy and positions.   I have a=\r=20\rgreat deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and=20\raccountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business on a=20\rglobal basis.\r We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and=\r=20\rAustralia.   Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work=\r=20\rwith them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.   This wi=\rll=20\rnot just be talk but we will get these people in place by specific=20\rdeadlines.   We will pay all of those people's expenses and of course the=20\rbusiness leaders will be on board with the hiring and the weather guys will=\r=20\rbe expected to be a valuable team player and resource to their group.\r On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure. =\r=20\rWe have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to ma=\rke=20\ra change.   On the communication front, we will have weekly calls with him a=\rnd=20\rthe weather group to make sure that we are all on the same page and he is u=\rp=20\rto speed with where we are going.   If I am in town, I=01,ll make those call=\rs as=20\rwell.   Jeff did have a video call with Thor last week to talk about his=20\remail and it went well.   Upon my return from London, I learned that Thor an=\rd=20\rthe London group put out a press release about putting out pricing on about=\r=20\r1,000 new products on 15 cities and even changing the index.   Neither Mark=\r=20\rnor Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even brought up in the ca=\rll=20\ras something that was going to happen.   Also the hiring of Lars Elmlund as =\ra=20\rweather   originator, without any discussion, also illustrates the lack of=\r=20\rcommunication or desire to work together.   I am not saying that Mark or Tho=\rr=20\rare totally to blame, they both deserve credit for not working together, bu=\rt =20\rwe are going to change the future and make sure that it will work better.   =\rI=20\rknow that all of Thor's group is very loyal to Thor and the weather guys ma=\ry=20\rnot want to transition into EGM.   If that is the case, we can make it work=\r=20\rvia London.   I think the key is our approach to Thor and that this isn't=20\rmeant as a reflection on him but is a change that is consistent with how we=\r=20\rare running all of our EGM businesses around the world.   The specific weath=\rer=20\rpiece of his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&amp;L=20\rsignificantly (he'll actually be net positive!).\r I certainly want to do this with the least impact on the rest of your=20\rorganization.   Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues=20\rsurrounding this new structure and the best way to communicate it to those=\r=20\rinvolved in order to implement this in the most effective manner.\r I am unavailable (London time) on Monday and Tuesday but will make myself=\r=20\ravailable to your schedule upon my return after that.\r Thanks,\rmike\r PS - This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyo=\rne=20\relse.\n"

In our weather business, there appears to be a lack of seamlessness.   Reporting relationships, P&amp;L, and vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.   Mike and I would like to address this as follows:   we need 1000% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business.   All identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees.   It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or   will be in EEL.   Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.   If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.   This restructure will similarly align weather.   Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure.\n"

My work experience so far has been excellent, and nothing less than what I had hoped for.   I have had the opportunity to hear you speak a few times in Norman and have been very impressed.   I have been impressed by the things you said about this company and its ideals, programs and its commitment to excellence - all of which I have seen since I started work.   The most impressive thing to me, however, were the things you said about positive thinking, goal setting, and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk with the J.C. Penney Leadership Program.   These are beliefs which I have been raised on by my father, and really believe to be true.   It was very inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has obviously worked.   As I have started my internship here, I am implementing this psychology into my life and work ethic, and thought you would might have some helpful advice.   I know you are an extremely busy man, but I decided to send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could speak with you about how this way of thinking has positively impacted your career.   If you ever have a few minutes of free time this summer, I would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.Thank you for your timeBlake Lasuzzo\n"

As we discussed, I am attaching a brief introduction toNexstar Financial and a copy of our latest press release. Nexstar is afinancial services company that is currently offering mortgage lendingproducts. We began the company in May 1999 and have spent the last 18 monthsbuilding a state of the art high tech (web) high touch (telephone) customercommunication/service center located in St. Louis Missouri... We specializein working with Fortune 5000 companies to provide superior mortgage productsto their relocating employees as well as to their   general employeepopulation. Our management team of industry leaders launched Nexstar afterholding senior positions with some of the most prominent mortgage companiesin the business today. Our Chairman, Marvin Moskowitz was Chairman of theparent company of Prudential Home Mortgage while it grew to industryprominence in   providing mortgage products to corporate America.   RickThornberry, our CEO and President, most recently held the COO and Presidentpositions at Citi Mortgage.   I serve as Managing Director of BusinessDevelopment at Nexstar and served as Managing Director of Sales at CitiMortgage responsible for the Corporate Relocation and Employee Program.Previous to Citi I served in several executive positions with PrudentialHome Mortgage.   Helen Garrity is Managing Director of Sales and Marketing.She joined Nexstar from her position as SVP of Norwest Mortgage, where sheled the corporate and affinity mortgage programs.   Our experienced andvisionary management team has been joined by some of the brightestindividuals in the mortgage industry.   Since May 1999, our collective teamhas succeeded in designing and implementing the most advanced mortgageprogram available to corporations and co-brand partners today, resulting inan easier mortgage process with reduced customer expenses and savings to thecorporation. I'd love to have the opportunity to meet with the appropriate peopleat Enron to demonstrate the benefits Nexstar offers for Enron's relocatingand general employee population. Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discussNexstar and how we could bring value to Enron. Thank you.   &lt;&lt;Enron intro.ppt&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;AGE press release.doc&lt;&lt; - Enron intro.ppt - AGE press release.doc\n"

I have attached his email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring it up to you.   Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.   Do we do anything like this with our employees?I would really appreciate some feedback on this.   Unless you think it is a total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate members of your HR team to attend 1 intro. meeting to listen to their pitch.   I would of course attend as well if you like.   They have an impressive customer list already.Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting.Thanks,Mike---"

After this meeting, I will take each of your presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM as a business unit.   Also please add some of your other specific goals that illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive position and/or market share.   For example, to be the largest marketer of coal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or what ever is appropriate.Also attached, for your information, is a recent   presentation from the coal group.   We thought that this was an excellent format and review.   In the upcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as well.   I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and format.Thanks,Mike \n"

I am currently a Development Support Manager with EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I   had the good fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.   He represents a company called IdleAire Technologies, Inc...   IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.   Their plan is to electrify truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.   Also, these units provide cable TV and internet services.   They have already piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.IdleAire's   goal is to: \"...evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television.\"Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, D.C.   Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and   Van Hilleary.   Also, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire Technologies.   These individuals support this technology because it reduces emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.   I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do.   He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and the capital to invest in this project.   Enron would benefit in several ways:1.   Greater than average returns.2.   Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.   (EPA Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc...) 3.   Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.4.   Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.5.   Open a whole new market the energy services group. (EES)I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.   If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce him to you.   They have a   very comprehensive business plan that lays out their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an executive summary of the business.   You can also find out more about the company by visiting their website at:ww.idleaire.comThanks for your time.Chad Tipton5-5310\n"

        " Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 12/28/2000 04:08 PM ---From: Terence H Thorn@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 12/222/2000 01:28 PMTo: Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Oxy meetingWe just finished the meeting   with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson. Here's a recap.Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons: 1) Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the resources are committed to do a world class job on the January 29 submission and subsequent presentations. As Mike noted- we are in sudden death overtime and the 29th could be the end of the tournament. 2) Revisit the \"street talk\" about Enron redeploying capital.Mike walked through the EGM organization, talked about our stock multiple   and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi   would hurt our stock price.Dale talked about their low multiple (between 4 and 5), noted that the market viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals, buy and sell assets, but really wasn't a growth company. They now have a stable cash flow, but need a   new beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing. The point of this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being dumped into Saudi ArabiaThey characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital. They agree on a division of labor: Oxy can do E&amp;P, processing and petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can do those too. They realize that only Enron has the marketing, structuring   and regulatory expertise. Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as some type of \"merchant banker.\" That's OK in the end- Dale even said they would take over our part of any project--- but we can't project that role initially. We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy.The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to the projects. They expect our competitors to say they'll finance things on balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we will open discussions on other ways to finance. Mike and I agree that this is probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today. Oxy believes that such an initial statement will never be public and we aren't really locked in an on-balance sheet approach. Maybe   we can do this, maybe we can't.They see this as a year long process with PDA's stretching well into next year, and 20002 when the real money would be spent. The short term crisis is   January 29 and we need a submission with lots of pages: we were criticized that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb, it didn't have enough pages- reams of paper to impress   the technocrats.   We will also need to prepare a smaller 15 page digest to be used for our official February presentation and a three page walk around summary. Casey thinks the production center has to be in the US.We also all agreed that the Jan 29   questions allow us to lay out all of our downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project. I have had the greatest success around the world when we don't try to force immediately on a country   a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to \"local conditions\" and implement the most important first couple of steps with the rest to follow later. In this respect,   our projects can include suggested regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom.Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground in Saudi.   Casey will be 1000% Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make all decisions. Who will be our lead person with the same authority? They don't want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed it's mind ( a little arrogant). When can we identify bodies and assignments and location? They want full time dedicated people. Either Dale or Casey noted that the old Enron would have parachuted a team in by now (Like South America where we landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the head with a stick). This is a very complicated political and technical effort,. The leader has to be good at both. Casey was excited that Rob would be assigned to the project (I guess you discussed this with him).They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this.Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the 29th deadline, I committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January (we had our first conference call yesterday), but Mike said he wanted to think about the decision point person and process ( we aren't about to sacrifice a deliberative strategic/consensus   thought process because they are in a hurry).We spent a lot of time talking about the process. We agree that the Saudi's will eliminate one or two participants, that each project will have subparts with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top.   They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent $2000-3000 million over the next 3-5 years. They see core project 2 costing $6000 million, 60% Oxy/Enron assuming one other partner and Enron half of that. We aren't talking billions (spoken like a true major).They are sure Exxon /Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face   with possibly Marathon as the other. Exxon is more interested in the chemical focus which Oxy will concede to them. Mike noted was that our worst nightmare was a partner (Exxon) who would throw away money just to have a presence).   We were assured that Oxy's only goal was to make money and if he projects didn't, they would walk away.The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration. Oxy hopes to hedge this risk with downstream investments (pipelines and plants) and hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will lead to a whole new series of projects.They are very proud of Oxy's role in this, claim that they were instrumental in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors, that Irani is the most respected American Arab business man and has   great access in the Kingdom, and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable to the Saudi's.We   all left great friends in good Christmas spirit.From our perspective: Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in international oil and liquids markets Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi people. We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their respect.   Can we do it with minimal capital investment? Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring, regulatory included. They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars held offshore by Saudi nationals.   The country can be a tremendous source of capital. It looks like 20001 can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most intense period of activity being in January. We   need to set up the team for the January effort. I'll have this done by Jan 1. There is the question of sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities. Although it may be too soon to answer (we don't know yet what is possible but we can shape that outcome), what is the end game, what do we want out of Saudi Arabia?   We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing. We also need to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say. Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture 2 (Red Sea). I agree- this is a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will make the Kingdom a great place to do business.   Mike- I'm sure you can add more. Rick -it's up to you if you want to send this around to the Saudi team.   Merry Christmas.\n"

Like you my background is not ine-commerce. I was most recently President of an oil company operating inColombia. I am a manager in the classic sense, experienced in planning,project valuation, economic analysis, contract negotiations andacquisitions and divestitures. I am fluent in Spanish having grown up andworked in Latin America my whole life. I bring a keen awareness of theLatin culture and, what's more, a strong desire to continue working there.Do do this I'm considering a career change and can imagine no bettercompany than Enron to make that change smoothly.Pete and I both feel that Enron should have a good situation for a personwith my qualifications; unfortunately Pete's group is actually downsizingand in no position to hire.I appreciate your time.

Our steering committee (Dow Nova, Williams, Shell chemicals, Canadian Pacific Railway, BP) has suggested that we ask you to address delegates on Enron's leadership role in e-business. I am making initial contact to explore this possibility, and to ask if is possible for you to recommend an alternative person within Enron, as I have lately learned you have changed positions. This is a high level conference for industry decision makers, which will give you an idea for this presentation: not necessarily the IT approach, more of a business strategy approach. I look forward to hearing from? you.Best Regards. April Wright \n"

As we discussed, I am interested in opportunities within your group, specifically the LNG arena.   I interviewed and discussed this issue with Greg Curran and Doug J Arnell on Tuesday the 8th.   I strongly believe in the mutual benefits derived both from my learning and ability to contribute to your efforts.   I am currently in my second rotation working for Dan Leff and Dick Leibert in EES.   I have been at Enron since 19996.   In my former role, I served as the controller for GPG Operations Support (CO 423).   There I managed 25 cost centers which perform O&amp;M, Procurement, Document Mgmt, and Regulatory Services for GPG and other assets across the globe.   My role was the sole source for general administration, budgeting, planning, and financial reporting.   This included management of $19.5M on a gross basis and overseeing the day-to-day operation of the Mustang timesheet system.   I also represented my organization as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the July 2000 implementation of SAP within GPG.   In my first rotation in Enron Energy Services I performed analysis, forecasting, and pricing of power and gas risk management instruments.   Currently I am working on projects ranging from Customer Satisfaction, system development and implementation, budgeting/space management, California Crisis Taskforce to new business ventures and cost savings initiatives.   Although an American citizen by birth, I have also spent 14 years living in the Caribbean.   I am a team player and a very motivated, high energy individual.   My experience, the responsibilities bestowed, along my willingness to give 1110% will provide a valuable asset to a group.   I would like to generate a dialogue with you regarding the issue.   If there are any questions or requests of me, please feel free to let me know.   Thank You Adrian Woolcock---",

I am also writing you because I have been contacted by an associate who is very interested in joining the LNG group. He has been working for Enron since 19996 and has been involved with gas transportation and EES. He heard about the Bahama project and thought that he could add tons of value there, as he was raised in Jamaica. He also wants to be involved with a group that allows him to have international exposure and, ultimately, the possibility of working abroad. I am attaching his resume, in case you are looking for people for your group.Have a nice trip back home.Fernando\n"

Metgas is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real value here. Today, Metgas is 1000% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG role, we should discuss ASAP.AG --- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with Rick and Clay.WadeRick Bergsieker09/30/2000 01:45 AMTo: Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Clay Harris/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: RE: Investment Opportunity/Dabhol Power Company   Clay:   I suggest taht you meet with David Forbes asap.Bill/Wade:   I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.

For fuel supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.   They will have BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way the the various voting procedures are designed.   I am not as familiar with the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to negotiated something there since it is still in development.   Also, there should be attractive commercial returns with each project.I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.

Due to Mike's heavy schedule, he said that he plans to be there on Thursday for the lecture and he will be happy to join the group at The Mont following the lecture, but unfortunately he will need to return to Houston on Friday morning.   He asked me to pass along his regrets for being unable to attend the banquet on Friday evening and the Board meeting on Saturday.I have contacted the Montford Inn to reserve a cottage for Mike, but they said they are booked.   They also said that they are holding 6 rooms for the OU Special Events group for April 19th.   If one of the six rooms is not being held for Mike, can you please suggest another hotel or inn.Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

I was very moved by it andyou know I feel the same way.   I have become very reflective with the more\"success\" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.   I am so thankfuland appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,it has grown more deeply.   I see so many people that have lost theirperspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate theblessings that our family has received.   Chris and I often discuss how wecan help others and what can we do to really make a difference.The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.

The course is a MBA course on privatization.   We currently talk about project finance, and the idea was for Bill Gathman to talk about Enron's Dabhol project.   However, this could be substituted with a discussion of Enron's project finance activities in general, or with another project.   There are 555 students in the course (48 MBAs in their first and second years, 4 law school students in their 2nd year, and Ph.D. students in various years).   Dates are either 16 or 18 April, the class starts at 10:30 am and runs to noon.Let me know if you need any additional information.   Thank you.

As you know, both myself and Gary have spoken to Billy about an opportunity in the Ag effort.   I think Billy could help us pursue the origination opportunities we discussed on Wednesday and help us develop many more.   In addition to the tremendous experience he would bring to our team, he seems genuinely interested and excited about the opportunity.   I know you and Billy have discussed the Ag effort and I wanted to know if you felt this would be the right move for Billy at this time.   Certainly, it is his decision but I believe he is looking to you for EGM's committment to Agriculture.Please let me know if I can answer any questions you may have.Thanks,   Elsa Piekielniak (37613)\n"

In the paper, I identified the hurdles we would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.   I further suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net Works.   I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move us along rather quickly.   I think the logical next step may be to get with you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal of creating a business plan.   Any thoughts?Thanks!Fred Philipson5-9323\n"

During our conversation, I had mentioned a business plan that I had written last year proposing a b2b platform for trading air freight capacity which received strong interest from ICG.   You then asked for a copy of it, thinking that Enron could use some background on the opportunity in air logistics.   If you don't mind, rather than send you a year old plan for a business that didn't get off the ground, I suggest that I work (on my own time) on a document that will speak better to Enron's needs, presenting the air logistics industry background and mapping it to potential opportunities that utilize Enron's core strengths.   I hope to have this doc done and delivered to you by the end of next week. Fred Philipson\n"

Understanding that not everyone will ever agree on everythingAddress a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas.   For example:   5 key large major areas could contain the following themes - 1 large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists.   Present a few artists as options and ideas.   Key trading areas:   could be modern and high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite, more serene commentary as a balance.   pick artists as an idea.Address key themes:   trading are will have xx, individual business unit common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xx.   Describe the area reserved for Enron   memorabilia?General theme considerations and guidelines: Innovation, global, as you've already addressedList out options with front entry area (Nevelson)Address old building and what we are going to do with the collection:   for example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be re-aligned, common areas will link with new concepts and themesA few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline:   e.g.:   20% will be spent on 5 key areas, 10% on trading floor areas...Timeline and the need to start nowUpdate:   RC set up and ready, funding by Andy FastowI hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted.

In London, everyone fills out a CACS form (Contract Authorisation Control Sheet), and if the deal is &lt; $0.5m, then a DASH is required as well.   Brad seems to think that if a DASH is not required, then the business unit head signs off on the expenditure?   Is there a formalised global-markets process for this, or is this a product-by-product thing?   (in which case, I'll assume LNG has no process, and I'll direct Eric to implement one...)   (Doug Arnell needs to purchase his option for the Bahamas land thing, thus the reason for the question).fyi, attached is European CACS form. Thanks,Merritt   \n"

It would be one thing to lose fair and square.   It was quite another to simply be \"mugged\"   (the word used by Jonathan Sumption).   Even worse, Pollack (your old friend) was overheard to say that it was a joke the way Enron got \"stitched up\".   Makes you feel a bit like you are in a kangaroo court.   One read of the opnion will bring tears to your eyes when they talk about \"what the parties really intended\" instead of what the contract says.   The only route of appeal is to the Court of Human Rights (which right this minute I am feeling that mine have been violated) so it's a tough one.   Anyway onward and upward to the broadband world (nothing's easy these days).   Thank you for your words of comfort.   I must confess that in reality I am actually struggling to come to terms with this one (because we are right, of course), but in the end I must remember, this too shall pass.

The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very pleasant distraction.I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.   I will have all my lease information with me.   I have a few months left on the lease and will have all the needed information to complete the transaction.   If you would, please forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side dealership.   I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.   Also I don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in that part of the dealership now.   I expect a fair price for my car and with our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.   I am confident that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal with my cash purchase for the CL.   I guess I just need a name at the dealership.

Since your planned trip is in October and today is 9/8, I have to assume that you should be in your car by then.   While I know what \"assume\" means, I also know that the port will not release any car until they have inspected it and have determined that it has no flaws (ie. scratched bumper that may have happened on the ship).   So, while I really cannot give you a 1000% guarantee as to when you will receive your car, I do believe you should be fine for your trip to Dallas.

        " Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 07/10/2000 09:23 AM --- \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Greg Piper @ ENRON   07/07/2000 06:49 PM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Jeffrey McMahon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Whalley Subject: Re: ClickPaper.com First, thanks for jumping in on this.   I am confident we can get it done even though it will be a fire drill.We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was just being held or managed in four places.   It will all   be pulled together by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person responsible, comments and date to be completed.   It will also have a complete timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.   Louise agreed to review it as well.As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you want to pull in after we agree on the control document.   That way we will know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with him for months).   She is going to get in place people to be our Product Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.   Scott and Salley will work to source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user IDs to clients.   We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their people unless there is some emergency.   Remember, we are only setting up people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.We also have a help desk person starting next week.   I don't have his name yet, but we have him and one more on the way.   We will create for them a brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.   We walked inch by inch through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.   We have a few holes, but it is not that far away.   She is going to think about a process document for this and get back to me Monday.   I have a detailed EOL one and we will give it our shot this weekend.Let me know what Mark Palmer says.   He knows we have been using Margaret.   We will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan and what she needs to do.   We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.   We will tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use this time to get them pre-registered.   Besides, there is no way to test a 1000 temporary IDs anyway.   We will send those out later.   as I said earlier, the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way people can surf the content and get registered.On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.   We will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control issues associated with it.   Credit is fine, we have been working with Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and views.The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to help the roll out.   We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 222nd for the final testing of the system.Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market only.   ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial offering.   Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather than later).   Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop but Louise said today that is October or November.   It will only be many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.Thanks.See you tomorrow.GPTo: Greg Piper/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: ClickPaper.comGreg,   a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, personnel responsibilities and key action items.   I think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments.Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.   You will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a couple of weeks.   He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.   He has others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper already).Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run:   Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck (advice and discuss additional resources).I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned.I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.   I wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday afternoon.Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective?A few thoughts,   see you tomorrow.mike\n"

As flattered as I am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.   I am very proud of our accomplishments when I was responsible as CEO for Enron's Global Technology group but my tenor was only about a year.   In August I was asked to take on another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.   Although this was an even more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave the technology world.Philippe Bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a great deal of the credit for Enron's recognized technology advantage and innovation.   He has been in the tech business for about 17 years.Sincerely, Mike S.

Some DE's are already on the regions' payrolls   I don't think this will have a budget impact, because at this time each region below is paying the total costs for these engineers, through EECC invoices.   Please let me know if each of you agree and I will have HR do the payroll switch.CALME (from EECC to Enron Global Markets)Ken KoyeMario BrunassoAlice WeekleyHemmat SafwatSteve SauerDave GlessnerMichael WorthemSaad MerhejMarion ColeOmar AboudaherCelia DelahoussayeJan DunnJoni MoellerAPACHE (none) INDIA (from EECC to Enron India)Ken BeanJohn BelewRam TarakadDebbie PerrottaESA (from EECC to Enron SA)John R.

The way I had it, AS, PB, DB and I (we had commercial and IT infrastructure covered in   1 call) all attended the video calls but I primarily drove the business activities and co-ordination.   I had envisioned Allan and your group taking over directly pre my change and pre other international ongoing activities.   I suggest that all of you re-look at it and do what you want but there are obvious big changes coming that will affect your decision and how we will approach the business opportunities.

I do not intend to circulate outside HR other than to then 7 of you, Cindy O and the other HR leads. This essentially reflects what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is:ENA - Me with Sheila Knudsen (I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to take this lead sometime next year).EGM - Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser (We believe Shanna will develop to lead this in the next 12 months)EIM - Me and Fran Mayes (the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead on this when she is ready).Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.David***TO: ALL ENA HRCC: Olson, Delainey, Lavorato, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, Shankman, R. Jones, M.Barnard, M.Joyce, D.Lynch, B.VanCleveFrom: OxleyWestern Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation ChangeWhen we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our businesses achieve and exceed their goals. In fact you will recall in communicating the changes in February, we actually highlighted what we anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to maximise our effectiveness.A great deal has happened in these last 6 months and I am delighted that the Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook, priorities and objectives. We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR services and advice. More importantly, the business has recognised us for the huge progress we have made to date. This success is an outstanding achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of.As is always the case at Enron, continuous change is the norm and so as to illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA have over the last 2 months, essentially been split into three: Enron Global Markets, set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously part of Enron Europe and CALME,   Coal, Financial Tarding and Insurance/Weather which were all previously part of ENA. EGM is now led by Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman. Enron Industrial Markets, set up to focus on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial sectors which will build on the success of the Paper, Pulp and Lumber business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market. EIM is led by Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen. Enron North America remains the largest of these three businesses even after these changes and will now focus all of its efforts on the highly successful Gas and Power markets in North America, including Canada and Mexico. ENA continues to be led by Dave Delainey and John Lavorato. Mark Frevert, following his return from Europe, has been instrumental in the restructuring of these businesses and is Chairman of each of these as well as Enron Europe, which collectively now constitute Enron's entire activities in the Wholesale commodity markets.These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to re-examine the HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly. Fortunately, our flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise have been. In addition, given the immense value and positive client feedback we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise skill lines, this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and refine our efforts in developing market intelligence, employment propositions, compensation ideas and best practices, as well as the innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to pro-actively provide our clients with a competitive advantage.I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self explanatory, however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them either with your team leads or me. Given that we have a staff meeting scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and answer any questions at that time.Finally, to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next 6 months, I would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex our resources to anticipate, meet and exceed our businesses needs. This will clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward. This is not Change for change's sake, but change, and our ability to change quickly and as often as necessary, is essential for us to remain a competitive and effective HR resource for our clients.\n"

What time is the meeting?RosieTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: EGM - all company meetingKen,Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency.   The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.   This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 5000 people.   We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months.   I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.   We had a record Q1 with $1000 million of gross margin.   That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.   Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance.Mike \n"

He runs a power business (i think) in Portugal.   He has attempted to talk to someone at Enron in Europe but hasn't heard back.   He has given me his email address and requested a contact.

I have doubts about   the fit for us.3)   For Weather how about showing the number of cities for which we   make markets?

This should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.Here are a few other points of emphasis.EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and commodities to enable them to grow quickly These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being active in themEGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are enormous in market sizeEGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset positionsEGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale businessesEGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earningsEGM has contributed almost $2000 million in gross margin in its first   2 quarters in existenceGo big or go home philosophyEGM will represent a clear transfer of   Enron wholesale market making model into other commodities this yearGROWTH is the key!!!Thanks for your help.MikeFrom: Kathie Grabstald/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/23/20001 09:10 AMTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ENSIDE NewsletterGood Morning Mike!The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and should be 3000+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your busy schedule.Here is a suggested outline.   If you want to fill in the outline with information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you. I.   An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward. II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes   II. Future plans/initiatives for EGM   (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) Please feel free to modify as you see fit.   I have attached Greg Whalley's letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.   I need your letter by June 15, if possible. Hope to hear from you soon.Kathie GrabstaldENA Public Relationsx 3-9610\n"

We continue to show signs of strong trade growth and gaining market share. I am hopeful that Arizona Public Service &amp; Conectiv will use the system more heavily in the future (hedge option trades) and that we can obtain at least one new counterparty a month vis-.-vis EOL marketing/and or our own internal marketing.   Our gain in market share has not gone unchallenged. Bloombergs Powermatch system has been more active in the last month and bid/ask spreads continue to narrow. To combat this we continue to show (90% of the time) the tightest markets and obviously offer a cost advantage over the Broker market &amp; Bloomberg.   The increase in EOL volume has increased liquidity in the whole market.   I am hopeful that overall market volumes continue to grow as we get closer to compliance.Number of Trades: 777Number of Allowances: 192,5000Approx. Notional Trade Value: $28,875,000\n"

I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.   That would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.

I am not an expert, so you should not publish any of my comments, but should contact an expert in the treatment of diabetes.You quoted Mike McConnell as stating that weight gain is a normal symptom of untreated diabetes.   My experience is that weight gain is often a CAUSE of diabetes, whereas weight loss is often a SYMPTOM.   It would be useful to clarify this, as some people with undiagnosed diabetes could delay seeking help on the basis of the quotation made.The quote \"...insulin is not a cure nor does it prevent the development of complications.   It is merely life support.\"   is totally at odds with the experience of the diabetics I have known, and could be quite alarming to someone recently diagnosed.   Most people on insulin need make only very small changes to their lifestyle and diet.   Properly managed diabetes eliminates almost all complications - the body effectively functions normally with the addition of insulin.   damage caused prior to diagnosis can not be reversed of course.   The suggestion that insulin is merely life support is alarming - insulin is life support, but not \"merely\" life support.   Life can be lived fully, and while there are probably some activities that can not be participated in, I have not met a diabetic who has experienced this.   No complex equipment is needed, the treatment is very quick, portable, inconspicuous, etc.   It can not be compared to dialysis for renal failure, for example, which is much closer to \"merely life support\".   Even so, many people on dialysis still live good lives.I think it would be very useful for you folks to publish something that helps people diagnose both types of diabetes, how they can avoid the adult onset type, and the effect on lifestyle of diabetes.   Perhaps you could find some nice statistics such as the most common method of diagnosis is when the patient goes into a comma due to high blood sugar (at least in some countries), diabetes is the leading cause of non-accidental amputations, adult blindness, renal failure, etc, and that the materials for a blood test cost about $1.yoursTom Halliburton\n"

Just after the Astros pitcher stuck out a batter, a cartoon came on the screen.   The cartoon showed 3 K's dropping on a batter, turning him into a small black puddle. The 1st thing that ran through my mind was the Klue Klux Klan, and some extremely unpleasant memories I've had with them. If I'm alone in my thinking there should be no problem, however if other people have similar thoughts, this could raise some bad publicity. I did not feel gong through the proper chain of authority would be correct in this situation. (The less people that know, the better)   I do not know who the proper contact is to voice this concern, but felt you would be in a better position than me to decide if this is an actual problem, and how to resolve it if it is a problem.Stuart\n"

We would like to have you present on October 10, from 9:000-10:000 AM.   The conference committee has chosen the One Enron theme since the attendees at the conference are coming from all the Enron business units both domestically and internationally. The estimated attendance at the conference will be 2225 Enron and Joint Venture employees.   The invitations are being issued enterprise-wide to employees who are engaged in operations/maintenance/purchasing.   This conference is the expansion of the annual plant managers' conference that is held each year in Houston.   We are replacing it with what we will be a \"Best in Class\" conference addressing multiple topics that will provide direction that will result in lower costs, increased earnings and employee retention.   We will also be utilizing this conference as an additional mentoring activity for our Minority/Women Business Enterprise suppliers.I hope that you will accept our invitation, because I know many of the participates are very interested in learning more about what Enron's ecommerce strategy.An agenda has been attached for your review, however it is still in development.If you have any questions, I can be reached at (713) 646-8235.

We discussed the subjects of Enron looking at the purchase of GATX Terminals Corporation and the hiring of an individual from GATX Terminals.As I mentioned earlier, I know an individual who has worked for GATX approximately 20 years in several capacities who is interested in joining the Enron team.   His name is Steve Denney and he resides in Chicago, IL.   He travels each week to Houston for his current job as President of GAXT Products Services (GPS).   Capacities within the GATX organization that Steve has held include:President of GATX Products Services (GPS)Executive Vice President Domestic Sales and Marking for GATX TerminalsSouthern Region Business Unit Manager (Texas, Louisiana, and Florida) for GATX TerminalsGeneral Manager of Calnev Pipe Line Company (a subsidiary of GATX Terminals)I have worked with Steve in different capacities since 19991, and think he would be a GREAT asset to the Enron organization.   I would like to introduce the two of you to see if there is a fit for Steve within our company.   You expressed interest earlier today when we talked.   If you are still interested, could you please advise me on what steps to take from here?I appreciate your time in considering Steve as an employee and look forward to pursuing him as an Enron team member.Thank you,Genex5-3515\n"

This was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.   It is a big piece of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we do).

Policy on Noncompetition.   I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2.Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).   Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.   The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a \"dumping ground\" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.   As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates.   The following is a summary of these competition provisions:Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.   If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.   Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&amp;M, offtaker or risk management services.There are a number of exceptions to this rule:   (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; &amp;copy; projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction.\"Affiliates\" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).\"Asia Pacific Region\" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 20003.Thank you,Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI\n"

The opportunities to continue to grow our&lt; natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical&lt; to Enron's future success that we remain focused on expanding these&lt; businesses and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.&lt;&lt; It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside&lt; of gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our&lt; earnings growth.   We have made significant progress in developing these&lt; businesses in North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net&lt; Works&lt; business unit.   Included in these global businesses are our efforts in&lt; crude and products, coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading,&lt; interest rates, credit trading, paper and pulp, and metals.&lt;&lt; While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to&lt; accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to&lt; aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North&lt; America and Europe.   In order to accomplish these two objectives and to&lt; capitalize on the increasingly global opportunities in these new&lt; businesses&lt; we are today announcing the formation of a new business unit ? Enron&lt; Global&lt; Markets.   This new business unit will focus on markets and commodities&lt; which are global in scope, but outside our traditional gas and power&lt; markets.   This new core business unit will operate in parallel with and in&lt; close coordination with the North American and European businesses.&lt;&lt; Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief&lt; Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer.   They will&lt; report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets.&lt; Mark,&lt; Mike and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global&lt; Markets.&lt;&lt; Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the&lt; Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:&lt; -   Global Crude and Products:&lt; John Nowlan&lt; -   Coal:&lt; George McClellan&lt; -   Currency, equities, interest rate and agricultural trading:&lt; Gary Hickerson&lt; -   Insurance and weather:&lt; Jere Overdyke&lt;&lt; Enron's metals business and Enron Credit.com will remain the&lt; responsibility&lt; of Enron Europe. The Paper and Pulp business will continue to reside in&lt; North America.&lt;&lt; With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased&lt; to announce the following appointments in that business unit:&lt; -   Jeff McMahon:   President and Chief Operating Officer&lt; -   Louise Kitchen:   Chief Commercial Officer&lt; -   Philippe Bibi:   Chief Technology Officer&lt;&lt; Jeff, Louise and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley,   will comprise the&lt; Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.&lt;&lt; With Jeff Shankman's departure from Enron North America's natural gas&lt; operation, all of Jeff's direct reports will report to John Lavorato.&lt;&lt; We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North&lt; America Office of the Chairman.   John Lavorato will join the ENA Office of&lt; the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.   Dave Delainey will assume the&lt; role of President and Chief Executive Officer.   Mark Frevert will retain&lt; his role as Chairman of Enron North America in addition to his role as&lt; Chairman of both Enron Global Markets and Enron Europe.&lt;&lt; Please join us in congratulating everyone in their new assignments and in&lt; supporting the new Enron Global Markets organization.&lt;&lt; \n"

He worked for me in 2 areas,   including directly for me in Technology.   He is outstanding and left enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco.   He was an associate at the time.   He is interested in coming back and is talking with many areas of enron for positions.   His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment.   If she does, he would really like to come as well - if it is possible.   I didn't know if you have a need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an origination type of role.   I wanted you to have shot at him as well.Mike---"

Plan is for Mike to get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.   If Siemens amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's spec to us.   Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.   This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):   (1)   if cargo \"off spec\" demand separate test using \"ashing\" technique (more likely to pass) and if it passes using \"ashing\" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute over acceptance of \"ashing\" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected (either because First Gas refuses to accept \"ashing\" or because off spec even with \"ashing\") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.   This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on spec.Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a status report.Please let me know if you have any questions.Cheers.

Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 20002.   Fuel deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.   To make matters worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is linked through the end of 20001.To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of the deal.In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.   Per conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level for the foreseeable future.To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately $3.65.   Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.   We are continuing to refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to justify delaying a writedown.   Given the current market conditions discussed above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas before they will sign-off on earnings.   Obviously, I have not recently discussed this with AA&amp;Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.Please call me if you wish to discuss further.   I appreciate any help you can give us in this matter.\n"

It is great to do market research if time=20\rpermits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.   As=\r=20\ryou are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=\r=20\rfirm (Brecker &amp; Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=\ret=20\rresearch projects.   However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20\rrequired much research.   I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20\rshape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=\r=20\ryears.   Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=\rs,=20\rbegin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.   There are=20\ractually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=\r=20\runtil after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.   For example,=\r=20\rHarvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=\r=20\ryear students until January.   As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=\rt=20\rin the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=\r=20\r\"spring\" internships.\r The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last=\r=20\ryear with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &amp;=\r=20\rFebruary and offers were made in February and March.   The only school that=\r=20\rdid not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=\r. =20\rWe did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20\rbecause they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.\r Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s=\rummer=20\rinterns.   This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=\r=20\r40 summer Associates (graduate).   We intentionally limited the number of=20\rsummer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20\rassignments.   Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20\roffers to join Enron.   =20\r The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20\rsummer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20\rundergraduates for summer positions.   They generally focus on MBAs,=20\rparticularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=\r=20\rthat Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.   Because the=20\rundergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20\rcontinued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=\rre=20\rwere 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).\r With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=\r=20\rwhich you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.   In your e-mail y=\rou=20\rindicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.   You did not howeve=\rr,=20\rprovide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=\r=20\rtherefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.\r While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=\r=20\rfrom UT.\r o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20\ro According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=\r=20\rcampus conduct interviews in the fall for \"summer\" internships.   Cindy=20\rattributes   this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=\r,=20\ror, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=\r=20\rall interviews   at one time. =20\ro In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =\ron=20\rcampus recruit in the spring for summer internships.\r We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=\rhe=20\rstatistics at this time.   I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=\r=20\rinformation. =20\r It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20\rdifferent than what we were told.   If you would provide the name of the=20\rindividual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=\r=20\rthe discrepancies.\r While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20\rdifferent than most of the other schools at which we recruit.   If you belie=\rve=20\rthat it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20\rsupportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20\ralready scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=\r=20\rprocess during the trip you have scheduled currently.   As you are aware, in=\r=20\rmost instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=\r=20\rthe respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=\r=20\rlike for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=\r=20\rfall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=\r=20\rsupport your efforts.\r I hope this has been helpful.

      "body": "\nSally,Thanks for the email and update.   I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this.   I believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.   I know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled   that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that momentum.   I am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait.   I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines.Please keep me up informed on this matter.Thanks and good luck with the students.mike \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Sally Beck   10/02/2000 07:13 PM To: Charlene Jackson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Celeste Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer InternsWhile recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made at the Program level to not interview this fall for 20001 summer interns.   In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 20001 interns.   I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's staffing.   When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.   It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs.   I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with no resolution.   When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.   Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do so.   They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information.   I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 20001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall.   While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.   As administrators of the program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus.   I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system.   I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.   I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships.   In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns.   I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you. Please let me know how this can be resolved.   With the help of James Scribner and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships.   I will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative ways to turn this around.   \n"

He is obviously wanting to resurface Infrastructure World.   As you will note in the last paragraph, he is basically staking out a position that EECC is going to have to spend $2 million on project management software development and   that he can capture free optionality of doing a deal with infrastructure world.On the surface of it, this does not make sense on several dimensions:1. It is not clear to me why EECC has to spend $2 million on project management software development. By definition, such software would want to be collaborative   and I don't understand the logic of why we would do it ourselves.2. If there is a seperate carve-out of project management software that is required for what we do that is separate from what existing functionality of Cepren, Buzzsaw and Bidcom is doing; we may have an opportunity to do joint development with any of these players. The question is picking who we think would be a winner and figuring out if there is a deal to be done. Allan and Drew, together with the EECC, have orchestrated meetings next week with these three companies to figure out ways that EECC may be able to work together with one of them. I would note that Bechtel is an investor in Cephren so it is not clear that they expected these to entities to be directly competitive. It is not clear that Infrastructure World is preferable to one of these other alternatives.3. It is obviously not my call as to whether EECC needs or will spend $2 million for Project Management software development (although I am skeptical). From an investment perspective, there has not been that much that has progressed on Infrastructure World in the last six to eight weeks. The principal change has been a significant revaluation   and critical assessment of B2B business plans and particularly revenue models. I would thus say that two months ago my assessment given the Bechtel/Hull involvement that there was a 75% ability to do legitimate VC at $5 to $10 million pre-money (as opposed to the $15 million that it was done at). I would say that the probability would be 25% of $5 to $10 million with significant risk of doing subsequent rounds. I would thus have a view that we should pass from an investment perspective.I have left Larry a voice mail that I am available to meet when I am back Thursday and Friday when I am back from my father's funeral. I will have a discussion along these points. I am on vacation next week , but   told Larry in the voice mail that the alternative is to meet with Allan (who is out this week) and one of the people from my team. ---"

We've just completed a white paper, entitled \"Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling Supply/Demand Balance.\"   You may find our conclusions of interest.Best regards, Bob Nimocks President Zeus Development Corporation ww.zeusdevelopment.com 2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250 Houston, TX 777042 Direct: 713-952-9529 Main: 888-GR8-DATA (478-3282) e-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com *** TITLE:   LNG's Role in North American &amp; Caribbean Gas Supply DATE/LOCATION:   Washington D.C., June 27-29 SUMMARY:   The winter of 2000/20001 confirmed the shift in the United States from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages in storage from the previous year.   More and more supply is shifting from the U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of Mexico has proven disappointing.   U.S. demand for power generation is expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 20001, siphoning off gas that would have been destined for storage.   Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.   The current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near full capacity at just over 6000 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how quickly it can recover.   The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas in 10 years.   Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from North Africa (Algeria).   These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).   Plans are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 20002; however, more are needed.   Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived to be unsightly or dangerous.   Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United States and three in Mexico.   New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and Northern Australia might supply these terminals. Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production (IPP) plants ranging from 4000 to 1000 megawatts.   Moreover, LNG facilities on Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via undersea pipeline and cable.   Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and community concern.   The June 27-29 conference, entitled \"LNG's Role in North American &amp; Caribbean Gas Supply,\" will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.   The conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to the United States.   * * * \n"

Although we have less than two weeks left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.   All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further instructions on turning in the walk forms.   Everyone has done an incredible job this year.   Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need to continue with our fundraising efforts.   Please plan to join us for the following activities this week: Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:000 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 26th, at 4:000 p.m.   You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 8:000 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at http:///ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf   or go to the Enron home page on the Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.   For more information, contact Sophie Patel at ext. 350555 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.   Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!   On Friday, October 27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.   In addition, we will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.   You still have time.   It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.   I promise this will be a blast.   The Enron tent will be great again this year!   We will begin with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.   Parking at the Sam Houston Race Park is free.   You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make you feel great.   This is a world class event.Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.

Mike is in Singapore at this time and we are not sure if he will be successful in dialing up to catch up on his e-mail correspondence.   Thank you very much for your message.   We solicit one time lump-sum contributions to JDF rather than per mile.   In addition, we collect the pledges for the walk - rain or shine.   The reason of course is that our main goal is to raise money to find a cure and we would prefer that weather or other elements beyond our control not impact our ability to raise funds.   However, we have a great time on walk day and we have a lot of people turn out for the walk.   This year we are anticipating in excess of 5000 walkers.   The total amount of donations that are turned in by Enron employees are very generously matched dollar-for-dollar by the Enron Foundation.   Therefore, the matching forms are not necessary.   If you happen to be in Houston on November 5th we would enjoy having you join us for the walk.   If you care to make a donation, it may be mailed to Mike at the following address: Mike McConnell Enron Global Markets 14000 Smith Street, EB 33328 Houston, TX   7770002If you donate $25 or more you are entitled to an Enron/JDF Walk T-shirt.   If you are interested just send us your size (M-L-XL-XXL) and location and we will get one to you.Thanks again.Cathy Phillips713-853-6898Mary Anne Collins@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS09/13/2000 02:19 PMTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: JDF WalkHi Mike -Saw your announcement regarding the walk on wEBSource.   Although I don't have the funds to fly down to Houston to participate, I'd be happy to at least make a donation!   How are the donations tallied?   Pledge per mile walked?   Lump sum contribution?   Let me know!I too am an insulin dependant diabetic - for 32 years now - and do know what a child goes through when diagnosed with this disease.   I just thank God that I have parents that instilled a strong sense of self and urged me to understand as much about the disease as possible.   I've seen too many kids and young adults, in my association with the Oregon Chapter of the JDF, that didn't understand and didn't want to deal with their diabetes - some of them dying at a very young age due to complications.   I volunteer my time to talk to newly diagnosed diabetic children, so they and their parents can understand that it isn't a death sentence, it's a way of life.   And a way of life that can be long and productive.Here's wishing you the best in your endeavors on the JDF's behalf.Best regards,Mary AnneMary Anne CollinsEnron Broadband ServicesDistribution Marketing Program Manager(503)8886-0687(503)816-4537   cellmary_anne_collins@enron.net\n"

I guess we were just too good at our jobs...   My quick look at the amended contract tells me that our best contractual avenue is to analyze the possibility of wilful default under the contract, in which case the cap on damages would not apply.   Peter, as you and I discussed, the Bacton option may help our analysis on this.   I definitely would want to get outside counsel advice on the point, and in any event I agree that going to Mulva is the right approach to begin with.   Peter, let me know what you want me to do next, i.e., should we let the upper management contact run its course before I go for outside advice?   I expect so, but please let me know.

I just got your email and I certainly concur with Jeff making the call.   He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva.

I guess we were just too good at our jobs...   My quick look at the amended contract tells me that our best contractual avenue is to analyze the possibility of wilful default under the contract, in which case the cap on damages would not apply.   Peter, as you and I discussed, the Bacton option may help our analysis on this.   I definitely would want to get outside counsel advice on the point, and in any event I agree that going to Mulva is the right approach to begin with.   Peter, let me know what you want me to do next, i.e., should we let the upper management contact run its course before I go for outside advice?   I expect so, but please let me know.

I am looking forward to the trip and learning more about what you are doing thus how we can help.   If we would have had any idea that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.   This would be most helpful.   We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in Europe and in the US.   Faster, quicker, smarter.   Thursday sounds great and just let me know about Friday.   Is Anthony in japan during the trip?   Anthony was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive.   Remember,   I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities.   We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus of the business.   I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to Sherriff.   It is mostly up to date although continually changing.   This will help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like.   On Wed, however, I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into our overall strategy.A couple of other questions about the trip.   Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?   I don't think presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have something particularly appropriate.   The discussion with EPower/EJ on Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what Enron is doing across the focus areas.   On Friday, I believe that in the proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary.   For the ACCJ, if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our e-comm initiatives this would be great.   We could put this together here if you would like as I have a couple of your recent presentations.   Let me know.   Also, what is the appropriate dress code.   The Japanese still dress up.   I'm afraid suits are de rigour.   I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions about new cultures.   Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?   We could try and find something, but I think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western.   Despite what you have heard, this place is not as foreign as rumored.   Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.   All of us get back and forth on the train and the bus.   We can get you a driver, but you won't get here any faster and is quite expensive (US$5000 one way).   I normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language.   If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel.   I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps.   Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip.   I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture.   Ono will set something set up here.   The hotel has its own massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours.Thanks,MikeJoseph P Hirl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT06/07/2000 07:25 PMTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Japan trip   Mike,We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over Thursday and Friday.   Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working on Friday.   Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for enron.co.jp.   This would take us through mid afternoon.   We would then go over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.   We would bring EJ over to EPower for your talk.   Afterwards we would have drinks with the main commercial team at EPower and EJ.   Dinner to be arranged for a smaller group.   On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with key IT/tech companies here in Japan.   To date, we have not yet met any of these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity in the country.   We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of Softbank.   We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.   We are also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on Enron and Enron Technology.   The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.   We will have more on this.For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass these along to you shortly.I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.JoeTo: Joseph P Hirl/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Japan tripJoe, I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.

Remember,   I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and opportunities.A couple of other questions about the trip.   Do you want me to make any presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?   Also, what is the appropriate dress code.   I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions about new cultures.   Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?   Do I have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.   I normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language.   If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me at the hotel.   I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it really helps.   Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel after the trip.   I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the Japanese culture.Thanks,MikeJoseph P Hirl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT06/07/2000 07:25 PMTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Japan trip   Mike,We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over Thursday and Friday.   Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working on Friday.   Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for enron.co.jp.   This would take us through mid afternoon.   We would then go over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.   We would bring EJ over to EPower for your talk.   Afterwards we would have drinks with the main commercial team at EPower and EJ.   Dinner to be arranged for a smaller group.   On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with key IT/tech companies here in Japan.   To date, we have not yet met any of these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity in the country.   We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of Softbank.   We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.   We are also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on Enron and Enron Technology.   The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.   We will have more on this.For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass these along to you shortly.I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.JoeTo: Joseph P Hirl/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Japan tripJoe, I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.   Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my two days in Tokyo?   Also are there some presentations or items that i could review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?   I will also be there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday (my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).

If we had 1/3 of our GSA price linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels notional or about 14 million barrels PV.   At 5% our exposure would still be 5 million notional or 2.3 million PV.   According to John, he would not be comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 2012.   Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.   As far as the economics of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics.   I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.Thanks,EricGuido Caranti@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT111/29/2000 09:27 AMTo: Eric Gonzales/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Emilio Vicens/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENt@ECT, Larry Lawyer/NA/Enron@Enron@ECT, Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daniel R Rogers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: Jose LNG - Off-take Comments   Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.SaludosGuido and Emilio Enron Offtake AgreementSection 2Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement.   Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.   In addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA. The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen (that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial   Close or NTP or Dec 31 20004). We will add to this list \"the earlier of\" something like: \"the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period of 10 consecutive days\". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to \"commercial hand over\" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for 4 months   for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or another EPC Contractor) already built in.   Section 6I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions.   Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 18%. We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they don't want us to sell down and then keep \"controlling\" new   LNG businesses in Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is.Section 7Where is the bonus calculation?   We did not include it now on purpose. We will include it when ever they \"remind\" us to do so. We want to have another fight about the bonus.Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the   terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than oneI thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero   Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).   Section 10you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate.   Is this your intent to have a mismatch? Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do.you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.   Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.   See section 18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue. The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. Otherwhere are the LD calculations explained?   I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default.   GSA default should match LD's in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery. In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months - we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will be available). suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.   What happens under the offtake agreements?   Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?   Will we have to create a reserve?   This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.   Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible (meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed production with \"Normal\" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already did. What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as well? The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the \"reasonable constant deliveries\" provision, damages will be payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.   Nevertheless, short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.   It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected.   Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.   Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.   Is this in your model? We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard (although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be willing to live with this?, probably not.insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling. It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA.insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law. put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements for financing requirements?

At 5% our exposure would still be 5 million notional or 2.3 million PV.   According to John, he would not be comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 2012.   Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.   As far as the economics of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to figure out our economics.   I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.Thanks,EricGuido Caranti@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT111/29/2000 09:27 AMTo: Eric Gonzales/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Emilio Vicens/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENt@ECT, Larry Lawyer/NA/Enron@Enron@ECT, Cris Sherman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brent A Price/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daniel R Rogers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: Jose LNG - Off-take Comments   Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.SaludosGuido and Emilio Enron Offtake AgreementSection 2Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the EPC agreement.   Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.   In addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA. The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen (that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial   Close or NTP or Dec 31 20004). We will add to this list \"the earlier of\" something like: \"the date on which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period of 10 consecutive days\". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to \"commercial hand over\" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement for 4 months   for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or another EPC Contractor) already built in.   Section 6I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing formula associated with expansions.   Structure could be set as in this contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 18%. We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they don't want us to sell down and then keep \"controlling\" new   LNG businesses in Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will clearly realize what our intent is.Section 7Where is the bonus calculation?   We did not include it now on purpose. We will include it when ever they \"remind\" us to do so. We want to have another fight about the bonus.Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the   terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than oneI thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we want to make it zero   Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).   Section 10you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the Equilibrium rate.   Is this your intent to have a mismatch? Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if they do.you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.   Will the banks accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.   See section 18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue. The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. Otherwhere are the LD calculations explained?   I think you need LDs for GSA default and another for plant default.   GSA default should match LD's in GSA contract less compensation to plant debt recovery. In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months - we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will be available). suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.   What happens under the offtake agreements?   Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?   Will we have to create a reserve?   This may be a big issue with the banks for technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.   Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible (meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed production with \"Normal\" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already did. What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as well? The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur based on the \"reasonable constant deliveries\" provision, damages will be payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.   Nevertheless, short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.   It will have to be some prolonged period for Banks to be affected.   Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.   Will the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.   Is this in your model? We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard (although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be willing to live with this?, probably not.insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling. It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to PDVSA.insert termination section In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law. put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements for financing requirements?

I believe it is critical for very senior Enron people to make a direct pitch to the President of the country as soon as we can arrange one.   We need to let the President know directly the benefits of the project and the strong commitment of Enron to the development of the project.   We have alreday done this several times, but it is time to do it again.I recommend a visit in early January of maybe Frevert or you Mike (maybe both). We can also use this visit to have meetings with the new President of PDVSA and, hopefully, if there is an official Minister appointed with the new Minister.   It is not easy to fit in the President's agenda, so please advise the course of action and tentative dates.Thanks,Emilio\n"

Anthes(Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading of natural gas and electricity over the Internet. That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 111, just prior to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion. Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and data-storage capacity. In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying to emulate its approach. First to Market \"Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market exists,\" the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example: online trading of data-network capacity. Indeed, \"there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the bandwidth-trading business,\" and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby, an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston. At present, there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware of these capacity commoditization plans, says Libby. But not for long, asserts Enron President??? Jeff Skilling. \"Within five years, the bandwidth market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets,\" he says. \"So for us, it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business.\" That's currently a $35 billion business. But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas, especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications. And critics add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell capacity, they might prefer to do it through some channel that's independent of the control of a single market maker like Enron. \"Enron's argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator, and that it need not have deep telecom expertise,\" says Lisa Pierce, an analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford, Conn. \"But I'm not convinced it's that simple. Technology isn't a long-term competitive differentiator.\" Houston-based Enron Broadband Services Inc., formed last year, offers IP transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network. Enron Broadband Services also trades - that is, makes a market by buying and selling - network capacity to and from other data carriers, conducting some of the transactions on EnronOnline. Enron Broadband Services also offers content-oriented services, such as a video-on-demand service it will market with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to home viewers starting next month. \"When we started the gas business, they told us we were nuts,\" Skilling says. \"They said, 'You're going to sell gas but not own production? How does that work?' Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again, and even louder than before. They said this stuff moves at the speed of light; you can never create a market. Then in telecommunications, they said we were nuts again.\" Despite its share of skeptics, some experts like Enron's prospects in this space. \"I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big,\" says Libby. \"The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning. And I think it has a lot of potential [for] . . . selling it to businesses and giving them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need it.\" \"We aspire to that kind of model,\" says Fred Buehler, director of electronic business at Eastman Chemical Co. in Kingsport, Tenn. \"In every sector, there will be one or two innovators who get out front and do things differently to create shareholder value,\" Buehler says. \"We're trying to be one of them.\" Market Maker Stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of Enron's glistening 50-story headquarters, and the company's technological sophistication is immediately evident. Traders like 26-year-old John Arnold, who personally executes about $1 billion per day in trades, have real-time access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second buy-and-sell decisions. That information might be a meteorologist's prediction of a colder-than-normal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of political instability in an oil-producing country in the Middle East. Behind the scenes, all of Arnold's trades are instantly analyzed and processed by a sophisticated, proprietary risk-management system and then updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide. Less than a year after launching the operation, 60% of the world's gas is traded on EnronOnline. \"What we are doing, no one in the industry did 10 years ago. Eighty percent of our income this year is from businesses that didn't exist 10 years ago,\" says Skilling. For example, EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent company's third-quarter earnings, which were up 31% to $292 million, compared with the same period last year. \"The change is technology-driven,\" Skilling adds. \"We couldn't do what we do without massive amounts of computing capability.\" In this regard, Enron joins a short list of companies that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., FedEx Corp. and American Airlines Inc., which famously pioneered various mission-critical IT techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of IT-enabled industry leaders. Among Enron's boldest ideas is its use of a single, powerful software-based trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds of different markets. Currently, Enron trades more than 1,000 different commodities, such as gold, natural gas and metals, on EnronOnline. \"The core of our business is our business model, which is a centralized risk-management and market-making business model. It just so happens that the Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model,\" Skilling says. But as a market maker, EnronOnline stands alone. For starters, unlike most other Internet marketplaces, it's free. There are no transaction fees or catalog, inventory or subscription costs for users. \"Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year, in terms of their capital growth,\" says Ian Wylie, vice president of e-business at BP Amoco PLC in London. \"And e-business is responsible for a lot of this change.\" Even more unusual is Enron's role as a principal in each transaction. That means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it's involved, unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers and sellers. In fact, Skilling, as well as Mike McConnell, who heads EnronOnline's global expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC, dismisses much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan. \"[Many of the] B2B guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board and people will start transacting, but it doesn't work that way,\" Skilling says. \"You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove.\" As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades, Enron, an established brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets, guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on EnronOnline. \"We're creating markets that were highly illiquid, so someone has to put their reputation on the line to say, 'We'll deliver,' \" Skilling says. But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants. Guaranteed access also ensures marketplace liquidity. For Enron, this is where the bricks and mortar come in. For example, to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market, Enron paid $72 million in July for Garden State Paper Co., a recycled-newsprint mill in Garfield, N.J. Skilling's current market fancy is metals, and in May, Enron bought MG PLC, a London-based metals marketer. \"You have to break the liquidity logjam, and to do that, you have to take a risk position,\" Skilling says. But once the logjam is cleared, Enron is just as likely to sell off the brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new business. For example, to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation, Enron is selling Portland General Electric Co., a Portland, Ore.-based power producer that it bought in 19997, so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the online electricity market. Eventually, Enron may end up trading commodities that aren't even considered commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or empty railcar space. \"Might we move into sauces or meats or grains? Potentially,\" says McConnell, who was Enron's de facto CIO before moving into his current role. \"You have to be creative every day,\" McConnell says. \"You have to be open-minded to trying new things.\" But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is Enron's core IT-enabled business model, which is what puts it in a class of its own, analysts say. \"People have talked a lot about systems that they're about to roll out, but there is just not much out there for direct trading,\" says Mike Heim, an energy analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. \"Enron rolled out its technology 10 months ago, and still there isn't much else out there. There hasn't been much competition [because] there isn't anybody in the same class.\" But just last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. launched Dynegydirect, an Internet-based, commission-free trading site for energy and communications commodities. Also last month, IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta, whose partners include BP Amoco and The Hague-based Royal Dutch/Shell Group, added natural gas and power to its online trading system, which already included precious metals and crude oil. Skilling doesn't get called \"nuts\" much anymore. In fact, he's a darling on Wall Street, where Enron's stock has soared from around $40 per share last November to $81 as of this Nov. 2. As a result, Enron - by all accounts, an Old Economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as a New Economy pioneer. Says Skilling, \"We like to say we were B2B before there was B2B.\" Thriving On the Unconventional As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot more about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling. Recalls McConnell, \"Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the Internet is changing everything. He said, 'We need to make Enron an e-business, and I need a guy that can run this as a business. We need to change the way we view technology.' \"I thought he was a little crazy and I said, 'Jeff, I'm not a technology person at all,' He said, 'No, seriously - this is going to be big.' So I took over as CEO of Enron Global Technology,\" and thus became the company's de facto CIO, McConnell explains. Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an unusual move. But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a result. Indeed, Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that's unusual in large, long-established companies, and in utilities firms in particular. McConnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old Louise Kitchen, Enron's head gas trader in Europe, spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading system, recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the development work. Word of the Web-based platform, EnronOnline, which is literally remaking the company, didn't reach top management until a few weeks before it went live. Kitchen enlisted the support of Enron's initially skeptical top traders, and she scoured the company for software developers and other experts. Her small army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying on with their regular jobs. \"It's an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through all the bureaucracy,\" McConnell says. \"No one went to the board and said, 'We want to change the way we trade.' You just do it.\" Glowing Endorsement Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the $40 billion energy company, he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s top Houston customers at a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy. \"I was very nervous,\" recalls McConnell, 40. \"I mean, McNealy is the guy, and here I know nothing about technology. I'd been on the job maybe two weeks.\" McNealy asked the attendees - all but McConnell were middle-aged CIOs with many years of IT experience - to introduce themselves in turn. \"When Scott came to me, I said, 'I'm the CEO of Global Technology, and we want to be the leader in B2B commerce in the world.' He kind of sat back and said, 'How long have you been in the IT business?' \" McConnell explains. \" 'About nine days,' I said, 'and we are going to take a little bit different approach to technology.' Scott chuckled and said, 'That sounds like Enron; it always looks at things differently.' He then stated that my CEO title and Enron's approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace soon, as this was the way of the future.\" McConnell says McNealy's endorsement had \"a huge impact\" on how he structured IT at Enron during the following year. \"I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view of technology,\" he says - a view of IT as an integral part of the business, not as something that supports business functions. \"None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all.\" Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they support. When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology, Enron had five CIOs who were predominantly operating independently inside the company's major lines of business. \"Each CIO had his own agenda, his own thought process, his own goals, and they did not communicate at all,\" he says. McConnell established corporate standards for IT, created a management team that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief technology officer, Philippe Bibi. But IT is far from centralized at Enron. \"We wanted to make people think about technology not as IT and support, but as an extension of your business,\" he explains. \"So we seeded people out into the business units. [IT] directs the performance review process, but the business units have the greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated.\" Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses, says IT organization expert Robert Zawacki, president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado, also in Colorado Springs. \"We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT, and [McConnell] is certainly one,\" he says. IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial, says McConnell, who is now president and CEO of Enron Global Markets. \"We really do like to try things and see what happens, and when you have an electronic platform like [EnronOnline] that we can model into different sectors, it's very inexpensive to try it. We are not afraid; if it's not working, we'll just stop.\" - Gary H. Anthes and Julia King   \n"

Thanks for sharing your success and letter.mikeTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Juvenile Diabetes FoundationI wanted to give you an update on my progress in EES with the JDF - - - -as of this afternoon, I have collected (with Enron matching) $4,6000.   This is the letter I sent to my solicitation list last week - ...   Pretty good for one week, right?Good afternoon.My 17 year old son has had diabetes since he was 2 years old.   Imagine this - as of today, Austin has taken more than 16,425 shots and more than 27,3000 finger sticks.   It never gets easier for him and it will never go away until a cure is found.   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult blindness and non-traumatic amputations, a leading cause of nerve damage, heart attack and stroke.   Until a cure is found, his health is better today than it will be tomorrow. Please let me know if I can count on you to walk with me or help raise funds for Juvenile Diabetes.   84% of the money raised goes directly to diabetes research.   My commitment to you is this - walk with me - I guarantee you a morning of fun, good times and the opportunity to meet a large, dynamic group of people committed to finding a cure.   Sponsor me - you will help millions of kids like mine that are desperately looking for a cure.   The walk is on Sunday, November 5, 9:000 AM - 4.5 miles at Sam Houston Race Park.   If you cannot join in the walk but want to help monetarily, please send your check payable to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) to my attention - 14000 Smith Street, EB 760 / Houston, Tx 7770002.   From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.   My son and millions of other kids with diabetes thank you as well.\n"

This year's offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.   We picked these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on \"mark to market\" mechanics, the LNG \"book\", enron online and any other similar topics that may be appropriate.   To that end, we are working on the following agenda:Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:   Mick Mcconnell/Jeff ShankmanLNG organization and strategic objectives:   Rick Bergsieker/Eric GonzalesLNG risk book:   Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch???Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:   Presented by Brad HitchMark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:   Presented by Brent Price2000 review/objectives for 20001:Eastern Hemisphere:   Clay HarrisAtlantic Basin:   Doug Arnell/Emilio VicensShipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne PerryLegal:   Dan RogersSeveral questions:Mike/Jeff:   would either or both of you be available to participate,at least for an hour or so to get us started?Eric:   can you be there at least for Monday?Jeff:   have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?Brent:   can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including key contractual provisions required)?FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements for this offsite.Rick---"

Upon first look, this business appears to have huge opportunities and ones that can be executed upon, especially if they consider themselves a core business.

A lot of people have tried to make this business work.I'll follow-up on Treasury Connect, thanks for the heads up.By the way, science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in chemistry.   He might be an interesting guy to get involved (at least at the edges) with this project.   I told him about it and he really would like to get invited to the next meeting.   What do you think?   It always helps to have an avid supporter in a new business.MikeTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: MEC   Congrats!   Those guys better watch out, you might organize them.FYI, we have an investment in a company called Treasury Connect that has an interest rate swap portal.   Gary is working with them to do a trade.   They are currently negotiating with the World Bank to provide a private label product to them.TC's clients include Xerox, GE, Duke and us.   I know with the webification of everything that we will be looking at those markets, but I would like to make sure our guys evaluate their technology offering before you move to far into their market.   They are focused on the very low value, commoditized transactions, so I don't know if it is an area Enron will compete for.Thanks,Mark\n"

We spoke with Harvey and Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.   There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one thing we also want, people.   I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.   Given our resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.Markx37408\n"

I think that given our notorious inability to plan for space at this company (We are out of space in London already 18months ahead of schedule), I would like to convince Jeff not to have a large DC in the new building and add to Ardmore which would on a per square foot basis be significantly cheaper we would have the added benefit   of havingan extra floor available in the new building!I think this is the best thing to do for Enron.Let me know what you thinkPhilippe\n"

      "body": "\nVirginia,Hello.   I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac impressionist lithograph.   I found them and purchased both from a gallery in London, William Weston.   They should be delivered this week.   They are beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.   By the way the Lichtenstein is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.   I have also purchased an Appel in the last month.I am interested in several artists.   Actually, a lot.   I will be looking for one or more of the following.   My concept is that overtime I would like to own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find something that we really like.   I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my wife's favorites and priorities).   They are kind of in rank order but as I stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.   I want signed and numbered.   I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an important fact in my buying decision.   I also realize that some may not have done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.   For example, I would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.   At least that is what I am thinking now.Bonnard (colorful only)LautrecSuerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any)Other impressionist or post impressionist lithosBraqueMooreArpRouaultModrianRothkoKlineMotherwellBy the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) that your gallery had a couple of years ago.   It was a cubist piece from the 1920s and I believe you called the technique a \"push wa\" (pronunciation Vs an attempt at the proper spelling).   It was for sale in a couple of galleries in SF and was about $20,000.   Is there 1 available?   Also I am still thinking about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because we already have one.   Thanks,mike \n"

      "body": "\nGary,1.   Correct2.   Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for all of it's employees.   Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year.   The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.   It is a very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent performance.   The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous sources.   It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver.   Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC.3.   I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the process as well as our group looking at it the same way.   An example would be that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest and greatest technology.   and could look at embedding a new system in the company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.   I would ask what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a competitive advantage.   It was a very customer driven (internal and external customers) process.   It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the bottom line rather than simply a cost center.I hope that helps.Sincerely, Mike\"Gary Anthes\" &lt;Gary_Anthes@computerworld.com&lt; on 10/24/2000 03:09:48 PMTo: Mike.McConnell@enron.comcc:   Subject: Re: One moreHi Mike, three more questions.

They may be a little sketchy but we can refine for you over next few days. I specifically want to go over employment agreement and comp information with you.Couple of things of immediate note: - MG metals is an issue from an HR stand point. I believe (possibly wrongly) that much of the NA end of this will fall in your world. Immediate issue appears to be desire to let go some staff that MG hired immediately before deal went unconditional that now don't fit. Hickerson is aware of where we are and I'll keep you informed as things develop.- I am planning to dedicate Cindy Skinner (Shankman asked me specifically for her and I think she is ready for this challenge) to the new business as your lead HR person but I also have Hoyt Thomas (you may remember him from 96/97 era) in the team for the next 6 months (he is on a contract at present and we may make it permanent). I'd like to discuss this with you next week.- I am planning vacation for about 10 days from Weds of next week, but will leave you contact numbers.David\n"

As you may know, George brought his full team to our office todayto review certain operational issues in connection with our deal, and tointroduce key members of the team going forward.   It was very helpful tomeet the team members, and to understand a bit better how your coal group isgearing up to be in a position to fulfill Enron's end of the deal once weget the synfuel facility relocated and up and running.   There are a lot ofadministrative and operational issues that AIG-FP, Enron and Aquila,collectively, are going to have to work through between now and theproduction start date to ensure that this deal gets off to as smooth a startas possible, but this meeting was a good first step, and appreciated on ourend.\n"

Pacificorp advertises that each machine is capable of producing synfuel at the annual rate of 1.5 - 2.0 mm tons,   for a total of 6 - 8 mm annual tons.   We will meet with Pacificorp early next week in Portland to discuss a due diligence schedule and ground rules for the sale.   We will obviously require one or more qualified monetizers to work with us on this deal from day one.   If we line up more then one monetizer it would be helpful if we appoint a single monetizer to be the lead, otherwise we may end up facing conflicting demands from each monetizer.Our ideal structure would have the monetizers immediately owning 1000% of the equity in the machines, while we provide the sites, coal supply, and synfuel sales.   We need to work with the monetizers to identify qualified operators, while not taking any operating risk ourselves.Given the \"lease\"   issue surrounding the Sempra deal, we need to make sure we structure Pacificorp (and AIG) as a mtm deal.   We currently have a site team that has identified appropriate sites, and is starting the preliminary engineering and permitting work on each site.   The sites include river terminals and mines in West Virginia and Kentucky.We expect to finalize Sempra this week ( 2 - machines on an accrual basis).   \"Team Synfuel\" will then focus their activities on AIG (3 - machines) and Pacificorp (4 - machines) in order to close at least one of the deals by the end of October.   Our goal remains to secure 4 - 6 machines by the end of the year.\n"

Greg has confirmed that the Astros have tentatively planned for President Chavez to throw out the first pitch on May 18.   We are exploring the possibility of a reception or other opportunity in cooperation with the Astros.   As you suggested, we'll also look into other potential contacts.   I will be back in Houston on Thursday and Keith Miceli will be next Monday.   Since it will likely take several weeks to flesh out the opportunities, I'd like to suggest that we limit e-mails to a work group of Habiba, Keith, Greg, you and me until we have more details to review with Mike and Eric.   If you are going to be in Houston during the next two weeks, I'd recommend that we meet.   In the interim, we will keep you apprised of further developments.

In a meeting between Jeff Skilling and President Chavez in late-2000 (I was in the meeting), Jeff invited Chavez to Enron Field as our guess. Obviously, Chavez was only visiting the city for a just hours and I believe the season started just a few days later. In any case, we have already done some previous lobby to get President Chavez to the Stadium. This may help whoever is managing the contant with the Astros (probably David T.).I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas. Nevertheless, I strongly suggest that we position Enron as close as we can to this opportunity (we will later see if President Chavez actually make it to Houston);2. In addition, in previous trips to Houston and in several ocassions, I believe Chavez has always met with George Bush senior and Mr. Mosbacher. I would not be surprised if he do it again. Probably your team can also target these efforts and keep the action at all fronts;Please keep me informed. I would like to be involved as much as possible to move this ahead.EmilioJohn Ambler03/14/20001 01:56 PMTo: Emilio Vicens/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Eric Gonzales@ECT, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Guido Caranti/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Habiba Bayi/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Keith Miceli@Enron, David Tagliarino@ECT, Dennis Vegas/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: Potential visit of Chavez to Houston for Astros opening day   Emilio,   We would be very pleased to pursue this.   By copy of this message I am asking David Tagliarino, who heads the sports marketing group to get more information and opportunities through our contacts with the Astros and Enron Field.   I am in India and Keith Miceli, who covers South America for international public relations, is in Brazil.   While we are out of pocket, I'm asking Habiba Bayi, who directs PR support for EGM, to coordinate our involvement.   (Although international PR will manage meetings, functions, and general support/strategy for this, I also am copying Dennis Vegas since sports marketing reports into him.   As soon as they have information on the potential opportunities, we will get back to you with that information and a suggested program.   If your contacts in Venezuela yield additional details, please let us know.   Otherwise we will pursue it from this end and keep you apprised and involved in the decision making process.John   Emilio Vicens03/13/20001 03:58 PMTo: Eric Gonzales@ECT, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Guido Caranti/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Potential visit of Chavez to Houston for Astros opening dayMike and Eric,It was in the newspaper in Caracas today that Chavez is invited by the Astros (Drayton McLane) to be the guess of honor for the opening night. The Astros played some exhibition games in Venezuela last weekend.   This is obviously a wonderful opportunity for us to get closer to Chavez. Can we do something to be part of this activity with the Astros?, I copied John Ambler to see how we can coordinate the efforts from today.

On your other issue, I understand and we'll discuss.Thanks,mikeJoe Kishkill@ENRON07/25/2000 10:18 AMTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: SA Networks EffortMike,You have probably heard that a tentative agreement has been reached on Project Summer.When convenient, I would like to talk to you about what that means for the South Amercia Networks effort.   Given that we have been pursuing this stuff through a matrix approach many questions arise.I am not sure of the Project Summer view or the Enron view.   I have the feeling it is not a \"big blip\" on anyone's radar screen. I did not bring this up during the weekly call because D'Arcy and Steve do not know anything (at least officially and/or from me).Also, for what it is worth, I am assessing personal options at this point.   I am not necessarily wed to the \"Newco\" (unless Enron puts out a former EI hiring moratorium) despite what people may be assuming.Thanks,Kish\n"

I am not sure what you said or did, but some of those activesnow think you are God. In fact, they put together a brochure that helped themwin the President's Trophy, signifying the best fraternity at OU, andpictures of your visit were prominent in the brochure. We were kind of hopingthat some more copies could be printed, but I am not sure where we stand.Just the same, I thought you would get a kick out of knowing that some ofthese guys are now getting down on their knees and saying their nightlyprayers to you. It has created a bit of a problem in the pledgeship program.If you recall, many of the fraternity's principles were based on God, andsome of the pledges seem to think Carter Ashton Jenkins was referring to you.I think with some hard work, this will not be an insurmountable problem,however.HFF,Greg\n"

      "body": "\nGary,There were two such events.   On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on technology.   None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.   It inspired me to keep going on a \"nontraditional\" path.   The other big   impact moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of Cisco.   It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, \"its a matter of survival\" speech.   That really hit me and our conversation was also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.   He gave me a positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron in the eCommerce world.   It was going to take a different kind of technologist.   That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John again and spoke with him at an Economist   conference in Laguna Nigel and told him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.   He also was very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.I hope that clarified things,   good luck with the piece.Thanks,mike \"Gary Anthes\" &lt;Gary_Anthes@computerworld.com&lt; on 10/09/2000 02:06:52 PMTo: Mike.McConnell@enron.comcc:   Subject: Re: Thanks and a few residual questionsHi Mike, just one more:You said, in describing the Sun breakfast, \"I'll never forget this; this had ahuge impact on the way I ran that group for the next year.\" What did you mean bythat?

      "body": "\nGary,Thanks for the email.   Here is my attempt to type out a response.   I hope it helps.1.   It was a matrix organization.   The IT personnel reported into the Global Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency   purposes rather than simply control.   They attended business unit staff meetings and the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant feedback.   It was vitally important for the \"customer\" to be happy and that the IT person completed the projects from the BU.   When it came to the review process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.2.   When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day working of the IT world.   IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly created 5th business unit at Enron.   Remember Global Technology had more that IT alone.   We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing around the world.Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.   He is in the office of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly appointed COO.   Both LK and GW are non IT people.   There are many VPs on the next level that are IT executives.3.   In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the world.   He chuckled and said something like, \"That sounds like Enron, it always looks at things differently.   He then stated that my CEO title and Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place soon,   as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize it and change its culture\".4.   When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.   For example, we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it for free.   Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was going great.   We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.Gary, I hoped that helped.   Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any other questions.Mike\"Gary Anthes\" &lt;Gary_Anthes@computerworld.com&lt; on 10/06/2000 04:18:40 PMTo: Mike McConnell &lt;mike.mcconnell@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: Thanks and a few residual questionsHello Mike,Thanks for sending me those presentation slides. They are good background. Andthanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most interestingand helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering afew more questions?1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you \"seededpeople out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had thosepeople be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head.\" So, atthat point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersedthoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central ITorganization for things such as standards, is that correct?2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,5000 IT peopleessentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT organization?Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two ofthe three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does anygiven IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT andto a business unit?3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you saidabout Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast. Couldyou repeat that?4. You said: \"We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'llsee five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different.\" Whatdid you mean by \"cannibalize our own business\"?.Thanks again.Regards,Gary AnthesGary H.

Jeff and I are very bullish on the opportunities in Japan are just now focusing on the specifics.   I believe that will also drive the structure.   You should have received an EGM overview yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our general direction.   I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.   We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on the PRC issue, the key is not simply P&amp;L but on transactions and growing the business.   I believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small.I am glad that you are coming over and also touring Enron Europe and ENA.   It will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified in the mean time.   Jeff and I will be talking about some of these points tomorrow as well.Thanks,Mike\n"

What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives us a very high bid price to build the house   because we are captive.   What do you suggest as a possible remedy?   Some sort of checks on allowing others to bid?   Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?   Without a cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.   What do you think?A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax.2. Earnest money:   I like putting it in title company vs. Flair.   3. Title policy:   Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it is prudent especially with the new subdivision. How much does an additional 15% cost?   I don't have any idea.4.   have provided5.   not sure i understand this6.   yes, delete 7. definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector8. add in clarifying statement9. agree to add builder obligation.   I am fine with a quick closing date and needs specificity.   Does he have an estimated time of completion?10. Rollback taxes:   I agree, clarify as to the exemption, we need to be protected here.111. add this to contract.   Flare may want the money but we should try it.I hope this helps.

Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a CostPlus Contract.   Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.   Heindicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plusbasis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater HoustonBuilders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one althoughit is written primarily to protect the builder.   Therefore, we may ask thata number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to noticerequirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes inthe indemnity language.   In addition, there may be some other changes werequest.   Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at theappropriate time.Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the DeedRestrictions as soon as possible.We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the homeitself.   When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have toprovide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rightsand responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List ofSubcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of theSubcontractors Flair intends on using.   We are sure that the constructionlender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriatetime.Should you have any questions or comments, please call us.\n"

SHEATELEPHONE (281) 367-59555FAX (281) 292-7905 February 222, 20001Via e-mailMr. &amp; Mrs. Mike McConnell13451 Belhaven DriveHouston, TX   777069RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair ConstructionCo., Inc., as Seller, and Mike and Chris McConnell, as BuyerDear Mike:We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter tous regarding same dated February 20, 20001.   We want to respond to thequestions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestionsand comments about the proposed Contract itself.First, the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for theproposed transaction.   The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real EstateCommission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents.We are interested in knowing, however, if the Contract was filled out by Mr.Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors.   If so, does Mr. Williamsrepresent you or Flair Construction Co., Inc.?   Please advise usaccordingly.As we discussed, we think it is most important that you have the opportunityto read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co.,Inc. intends on using for the construction of your home.   The fact thatFlair is both the Developer, as well as the potential Builder, raises someissues.   Usually, Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding thepurchase of lots and building on same.   Often, lots are reserved to certainBuilders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use thedesignated Builders.   However, often lots are free to be purchased bypotential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want.   We areinterested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reservedto Flair Construction Co. Inc., or is Flair just requiring you to use themto build your home since they are selling you the lots in question?   As youpoint out in your letter, if you sign the Contract as it now reads, you arecaptive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders.It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this newsubdivision.   We think it is critically important that you get a copy of theDeed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that thereare restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built, size oflots, etc.   We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical forthe neighborhood.We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City ofHouston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.   This is something youmay want to find out as soon as possible.   If it is outside the city limits,is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewerservices?   Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding itsfuture development and tax rate is very legitimate.   Usually, until thesubdivision is fairly well built out, the Developer controls the CommunityAssociation as well as the Architectural Control Committee.   Therefore, ifthis subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of theDeveloper.We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recentcustomers of Flair Construction Co. Inc., to make sure that they were happywith the construction of their homes, as well as warranty work.   SomeBuilders are far better than others as it relates to follow-up warranty workafter their customers move into their homes.   We normally recommend thathomeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items arecompleted to the satisfaction of the homeowner.The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract.   Wewill now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological orderregarding the Contract:1. Paragraph 2. PROPERTY.   As we previously stated, we think it is importantthat you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictionsas soon as possible.   You will be responsible to pay assessments to theProperty Owners Association.   Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer,you may want to ask Mr. Kent for an estimate of what your CommunityAssociation Fees will be.2. Paragraph 5. EARNEST MONEY.   We suggest that the earnest money be paid tothe Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co. Inc.3. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY.   (6)   The standard printedexception as to discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundarylines, encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in yourOwners Policy.   In other words, the title policy does not cover these typesof discrepancies or conflicts.   However, if a survey is completed and anadditional fifteen percent (15%) of the policy premium is paid, the titlecompany will probably delete this exception.   This is something you may wantto consider.   However, this cost would be yours to incur.   If, however, itis subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflictsor shortages, then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly.4. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY, last paragraph.   Make sure you areprovided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible.5. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B (3).   It appears to us that theonly survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the newrecorded plat of the subdivision.   Therefore, the Seller is not providingyou a survey of your actual lots.   If you were to have the standard printedexception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted, we believe you wouldneed a survey of your lots.   You will have seven (7) days after you receivethe Commitment and/or the survey to object in writing to any mattersdisclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly.Therefore, please make sure that we have the opportunity to review thesurvey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same.6. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY (6).   We agree that this paragraphrelating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for saleshould be deleted.7. Paragraph 7. PROPERTY CONDITION: B (1).   We suggest that this paragraphbe checked and utilized rather than paragraph 7B (2) which states that youwill be accepting the property in its present condition.   Paragraph 7B (1)states that you will pay a fee, usually very small, like $1000.000, for theunrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property isnot suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it.   In otherwords, you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at theproperty to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction.We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner toinspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses.   Inaddition, there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questionsthat an inspector might raise if given the opportunity.   As the Contract nowreads, you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to sendan inspector out to the property accordingly.8. Paragraph 8. BROKERS' FEES.   You may want an affirmative statement thatyou as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers' fees.9. Paragraph 111. SPECIAL PROVISIONS.   It is written in that the closing onthese lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 20001,whichever is later.   However, we do not know what roads are being addressedand think that this sentence needs far more specificity.   The secondsentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already beenaddressed earlier.   The third sentence regarding when construction muststart should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in yourletter.   However, we also suggest that the Builder be put under anobligation to start construction within thirty (30) days after the date younotify him that you are ready for construction to begin.10. Paragraph 13. ROLLBACK TAXES.   If there was ever an agricultural ortimber exemption on this property, you need to know.   Otherwise, you will beobligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five (5)years.111. Paragraph 18. ESCROW.   As we indicated earlier, we believe your earnestmoney should be paid to the title company.   In light of the fact that theearnest money is in excess of $50,000.000 and the closing date on the lots issomewhat uncertain, we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit theearnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a creditaccordingly.Please call us after you read and review this letter.   Very truly yours,   Donald S. StirmanDSS/csb\n"

(There are a lot of conferences with happenings for power traders)Most of the participants were traders or very interested in trading.Could we do any deals that evening? We invited them because they should start doing deals with Enron.Several of the companies attending needed to change their risk policy to do weather deals.Lottery:We made a lottery that was similar to a weather deal. But we made the option premium to 15,-   Nok and max payment if the option stroked to 1000,- NOK. Our counterparties should not loose a lot of money, so they paid the premium upfront and they was not allowed to sell any options. The counter parties, that were the traders and not the companies, did their first weather deals with Enron.   It was important that the traders could go short or long or both. (Buy both put and call, for the traders that was afraid of their possitions) Some bought 10 contracts and they really felt that they traded weather deals. The most positive in my opinion was that over 20 companies have traders that have done weather deals already.EnclosedLottery weather contractDeal/Guest list\n"

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:   we need 1000% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business.   All identified employees in the weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition and the need to hire additional employees.   It is important that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be in Weather, or   will be in EEL.   Once done, Mark will begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.   If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.   This restructure will similarly align weather.   Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure.\n"

Good luck inMiami, I will be rooting for your Sooners (that's hard to say). Give me acall when you get a chance so we can follow up on Enron and Nexstaropportunities. Thank.   Hook-em, Don\n"

It's already that time of year for the bigshoot-out when the Horns tangle with the Sooners. It looks like this couldbe another very interesting game, no telling what will happen with the wayboth teams are playing this year. I have been thinking of you and I had planned to call you to talk alittle business. Our company, Nexstar   is now up and running and workingwith major corporations like Enron to provide mortgage loans to theirrelocating employees and as a benefit to the general employment base. We area high tech , high touch approach to mortgage lending providing employeeswith internet and/or telephony interaction with Nexstar. As a follow-up toour discussion in the bar last year in Dallas, I thought we could chat aboutwhat's going on in the financial services industry and if Nexstar's productsand services could be of any benefit to Enron. If you have any interest youcan view our website at nexstarhome.com.Please drop me a note or give me a call so we can catch up and even talk alittle business. I also wanted to talk about that ballpark with your name onit. I have not had a chance to see it yet but plan to when I get down toHouston. Take care, and don't forget to HOOK-EM   Horns!   Don\n"

My work experience so far has been excellent, and nothing less than what I had hoped for.   I have had the opportunity to hear you speak a few times in Norman and have been very impressed.   I have been impressed by the things you said about this company and its ideals, programs and its commitment to excellence - all of which I have seen since I started work.   The most impressive thing to me, however, were the things you said about positive thinking, goal setting, and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk with the J.C. Penney Leadership Program.   These are beliefs which I have been raised on by my father, and really believe to be true.   It was very inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has obviously worked.   As I have started my internship here, I am implementing this psychology into my life and work ethic, and thought you would might have some helpful advice.   I know you are an extremely busy man, but I decided to send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could speak with you about how this way of thinking has positively impacted your career.   If you ever have a few minutes of free time this summer, I would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.Thank you for your timeBlake Lasuzzo\n"

I was captivatedby your talk and continue to be impressed with EnronOnline's success in theworld of e-business.With this email I am inviting you to serve on a panel that I am assemblingfor the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in NewOrleans, Louisiana on December 16-19, 20001.   ICIS is the premiereconference for IS academicians and is described athttp:///isds.bus.lsu.edu/icis20001/ Approximately 12000 IS researchers andprofessors from around the world, as well as IS practitioners, are expectedto attend this year's conference. Thus, this conference has a very broadreach within the IS academic community. The panel would be a wonderful venueto share with the IS research and teaching community the e-business inroadsthat EnronOnline is making.   The topic of the panel would be to explore your projections and that of theother panelists about how electronic exchanges may morph over the next fiveyears.   You would also be asked to describe the business model used byEnronOnline, and talk about factors promoting its success and issueswarranting attention for its future growth. The other three panelists would be myself, Arun Rai (Professor at theeCommerce Institute at Georgia State University), and Marshall McGraw(Business Services Manager for Information &amp; Technology Services at PhillipsPetroleum).   The panel would last approximately 111/2 hours, but I would notknow the specific day (i.e., Dec 17th, 18th or the morning of Dec 19th)until early Fall.I would like to call you and talk with you about your interest in serving onthe panel.

      "body": "\nDan,Thanks for the email and quick response.   I am in the process of discussing this with various people.   A couple of observations that have become clear and   I want to pass them on to you.   Overall, the size of the transaction is not going to fly.   If we brought in other players and significantly reduced our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play, it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal.   Rick Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus.I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been reconfirmed this morning.   I understand that the deal is very active and needs to move forward now, but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we will not take the entire deal.   Last night George stated that he may not want to tell them that and I agreed.   But upon reflection, I think that needs to be re-addressed.   The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that, then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal potentially closed with these guys.   Also having them assist in bringing others to the table might be beneficial.I'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more.MikeDaniel Reck08/07/2000 06:34 PMTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: George McClellan/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: draftMike and Jeff:Attached is a copy of the Pacificorp presentation from last week.   To reiterate, the key commercial risk issues are:1)   Tax---Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the qualifications of the Pacificorp machines.   Thorough due dilligence will be required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling applications.2)   Syndication---Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find monetizers.   Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.   Realistically, we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we can shed our ownership.   Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in as 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the former owner staying in the game.3)   Operations---The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the equity.   Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an operator.   For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.   We will guide the monetizers to this risk.   If we have to indemnify them in this area, we will need to better understand the available insurance products.4)   Marketing---This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.   The desk believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over the next 12-18 months.   We have put $6.000/ton into the model, and the desk will buy $3.000/ton today for seven years.   The current market is anywhere from $1.000-3.000/ton.   We have also developed a list of strong sites that are looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or marketing agreements.The economics of the deal are compelling.   We put out $1000mm to Pacificorp as an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).   We collect $30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity origination.Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure around the risks.   The decision we need from senior management is whether this is a game we want to play.   The machines fit into the letter of the law.   Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined in the reindeer games.   We can put on the position we want by bridging this deal.On the flip side, people have heartburn over \"spirit of the law\" issues and those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this week whether to put resources on it.   We can back out later (our commitment so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.Please let me know your thoughts.Regards,Dan\n"

These initiatives relate to using internet technologies to improve customer satisfaction, improve productivity, shorten the sales cycle, etc, not directly to transacting per se.   For example, we are creating a customer portal that will allow our existing customers to get access to a variety of information---such as billing, energy usage, project status, general news, etc.---all through a single browser view that can be customized to present only the information that the customer's interested in.   Another application we're exploring would use internet technology to streamline the deal process through on-line collaboration with our prospective customers.   Although these wouldn't be considered traditional e-commerce initiatives, they're examples of using the internet to create more value through better execution in our business.   Do you want to start tracking these kinds of initiatives too?

        " Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 10/18/2000 10:10 AM ---From: Doug Leach on 10/17/2000 10:31 AMTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: follow-up to EBR   Just to give you an example of the requests that came up one day last week within Enron directed to me.1) The Panama office (EGE-MINSA) called with budget help and need forward Panama Parity prices for Bunker C and MDO for the next 15 months. There is no forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched more. 2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural gas prices back to 19993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them make a better case with their customer. 3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions at the plant. 5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new product to be offered to Conoco.7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them operate. 8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge tied to crude. 9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking for. All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it.\n"

I would like to catch up with all ofyou.   not sure of people's schedules but please advise me of your availability and hope most of you can make it for dinner on thur.   I will list some important things to me that I   wouldlike to discuss and propose some thoughts on positive changes for 20001.teamwork/communication/teaching/guidance/leadership -   these are the major areas we should bethinking about how we can improve.   teamwork - I feel we look at each commodity (crude/light distillates/middle distillates/heavy distillates/lpg/petrochemicals) as a separate business.   try to identify team leaders to provide direction for that business,establish resources required to meet proposed budgets, and work on individual limits for the traders in thosegroups.   communication - once we have established global teams this should improve significantly.   'the road to hellis paved with good intentions' and until traders bonuses are directly tied to the profitability of someone in another office I don't think we will communicate as effectively we need to.   we have very few niche markets toexploit that provide us with guaranteed revenues or allow most of our physical traders the ability to trade wellwithout a strong understanding of the push/pull forces at work from the other centers.   for the last two yearsthis has been cited a main area for improvement.   to get to where we want to be I feel it has to be done throughglobal books.   teaching - given that the growth of the group has shifted away from hiring from the outside and toward internalrecruiting we need to focus on how we develop and keep young talent.   also, given the lack of depth in ourtrading group it is important that our best traders be given the additional responsibility for development of talent in their teams.   guidance - I feel that if   we move toward smaller business units it will be easier for individuals to understandwhat the strategy is and what their specific role in that strategy is.   we lost a lot of people at this time last yearand the common complaint amongst all of them was they couldn't see where this group was headed.leadership - with a group of 1114 people at last count it is important to start thinking about ways to encouragemore people to make a greater   personal investment in making this group a success.   not just meeting abudget but also in creating a   business that will survive the exit of   any individual.   a business that will havea competitive advantage and that those involved in it will be highly motivated to keep growing.   if there is consensus on the need to improve upon the above then we can analyse how we go about it.I believe that by going toward global books we could improve upon many of our weaknesses.   chemistryis the major concern on a such move but best looked at in context of each group.   there are many other important issues such as eol, marketing team, research group, recruitment, etcbut I honestly think we have to focus first on how do we make most with the exisitng group and thenfigure out how to try to build upon it.look forward to seeing you on weds aftn or thursday and please email when/if you have free time tomeet up.thanks,chris. \n"

I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate this further.   I think George is interested if there was a specific opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.Thanks,Basil\n"

Enron can trade gasoline as a commodity the same as natural gas and electricity.   The idea is any one can buy an amount of gasoline at a pre-determined price with a certain premium for an extended period.   Which means there is an expiration date for the investor or buyer.   When the gasoline price is low, such as last year, people are able to buy a certain amount of gasoline from Enron,( Enron is to negotiate with gasoline producer for an amount and certain price (whole sale) that Enron believes they can sold in a certain period of time through market study and be able to make the profit), say   3000 gallons regular unleaded and with 10% (the profit margin to be determined   by Enron) premium.   The buyer will receive a debit or credit card to be used to purchase the gasoline and   the amount will be automatically recorded   each time when they fill up the cars until the amount of pre-purchased gasoline is used up in that period of time (prior to the expiration date).   The buyers (or customer) can also sell the unused gasoline back to Enron anytime before the expiration day the same price they bought from Enron for profit if the market gas price is lower or take a loss if the market price is higher.   By doing this, Enron creates a market that can allow customers to short the gasoline when the market is high.   There are many other ways to trade the gasoline. Nevertheless, the potential market ( if a minimum of 50% household can sign up) is tremendous.   I sincerely believe that Enron has the capability to make it happen through existing Enron online e-business. We hope this idea has not been thought out before for its feasibility.Regards,Peter LeeWarren WangVictor WuThomas LiuCC Yang,Justo Wang Liong \n"

        " Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT on 05/03/20001 10:53 AM ---Morten E Pettersen@ENRON05/03/20001 03:15 AMSent by: Morten E Pettersen@ENRONTo: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Tokyo opportunitiesHello Mike, I tried to call you several times yesterday but you were busy all the time. The reason why I called is that I have some questions that I will like your input on before I take a decision. I will try to call you later today but here are some of the questions.You and Jeff talks about a senior position for me. What do you mean by that and what will Joe's position be. Will he still be the \"president\" or will he take a more active role on the origination side. What will Jeremy's role be. Today he does all these senior structuring deals with EGM products.Focus. There are very many commodities to look at here but since we have limited resources at this stage we need some focus in the beginning. If we look at everything at once - nothing will happen.There are two areas that looks \"easy\" to start with. Softs and Liquids. How willing are EGM to focus on these in the beginning. The reason for I call these areas \"easy\" is that there are big and very liquid liquids and soft markets here and it therefore will possible to do transactions early to get some momentum in the business. The other markets have large potential but will take much longer time to develop. I look at Equity/FX/Interest as something Darren will continue focus on.When some of these markets start to develop and we will have some marketing activities/trading going on where will the books probably be and to whom will we report. If we do Softs will it be to Gary or will it be to Jeff. How will it be integrated. I have no problem with say reporting liquids etc to John Nowlan, Softs to Gary, weather to Mark. I think this will be a good solution because it will force them to follow us up and it will be easier to communicate strategies back and forth etc. The situation today on weather is something that I do not like. We have the book, but we do not have any real support from Houston or real responsibility. If that is the situation we will soon have a lot of problems. It is not a secret within Enron that the Singapore oil situation, coal in Asia/Australia and the weather in Scandinavia/Europe are not optimal. For me to take a decision I will need to know that there are support and willingness from all the heads of EGMs different commodities for developing the possibilities in this region, not only from you and Jeff. I do not want to use all my time fighting internal battles, but I know that it will be hard work to make a business grow.Staff. In my power trading group today I have 2 managers and 9 AAs. The managers + 2 Asso are what I call marketing guys and the rest are analysts (some with trading potential). We have no one with trading background in EGM products so that need to be recruited. At the same time many of these AAs have started within the last 6 months so they are not fully Enronized so it would be a good idea to send over some AAs or managers to teach people models etc. You mentioned Singapore in the TC, what will happen with them?How does EGM reward people for starting up businesses. It was almost impossible to get someone to help me building up the power here (both London and Houston). People, especially not traders, do not want to leave a profitable book or origination activities. Quite many got the feedback in last PRC that they need a number to their name, both P&amp;L and number of originated deals, so they did not dare to leave. How will that be handled here?I think my main strength is trading, and I prefer to do trading, but I have quite good origination skills. Iknow that in a start up process you need to do both and I am more than willing to do that. This was a lot of questions but to get some feedback on them are necessary for me to take a decision. I will probably go to London on Wednesday and Thursday next week to speak with Sherriff etc. I will try to call you later todayRegardsMorten Erik\n"

The most significant is the suggestion that we requestpermission from the Negotiating Team to begin discussions with the othershort-listed companies about possible consortium arrangements.   We want tomake sure that Enron is comfortable with that at this stage.

Please make changes to make more accurate and effective.   I will send this to him and follow up with a discussion.   It needs some work.mdraftJohn,I have just had some additional discussions on our Global weather business and have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I believe that we do   need 1000% full time dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall development and execution of or global strategy and positions.   I have a great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business.We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and Australia.   Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.   This will not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines.   We will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to their group.On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure.   We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make a change.   We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are going.   Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it went well.   Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the index.   Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even brought up in the call as something that was going to happen.   Also the hiring of xx as a weather   originator, without any discussion, also illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together.   I am not saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for not working together, but   we are going to change the future and make sure that it will work better.   I know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to Thor and may not want to transition into EGM and if that is the case, we can make it work via London.   I think the key is our approach to Thor and that this isn't meant as a reflection on him but is a consistent change with how we are running all of our businesses around the world.   The weather piece of his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&amp;L significantly (he'll actually be net positive!)Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new structure and the best way to communicate it to those involved to make this the most effective.This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyone else.mike\n"

Rob Tesar.   Position: Enron Networks, Agricultural Markets.   Rob Tesar is American and has worked for 15 years at Cargill, the first 10 or so inside the   grains businesses where he managed the central hedging desk out of headquarters.   He is a class act; if he has any weakness it would be a tendency to   be too cautious.   He is significantly underutilized in his present position.2. Detlev Hartman.   Position: open.   Detlev is German and was my boss at DG BANK in Frankfurt, in the early stages of the development of the finanical   derivatives markets in Germany in the late 80's.   His professional background is diverse with a pretty consistent emphasis on finance.   Detlev is one of the   brightest, intuitive minds I've ever worked with; he could contribute in the MG initiative or in any number of trading, risk management oversight positions.   Somewhat volatile personality, but exciting to work with.Daudi Lelijveld.   Position: Enron Networks, MG or logistics.   Daudi is a dutchman with a broad background; he has run Cargill's UK metals business for the last 5 years, or so.   He is putting his resume together and I'll forward. Paul Lichter and Mike Walden.   Position: IT - I have forwarded information to Jahn Pavetto.   \n"

D'Arcy Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot of people there.   He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.   On a recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.   Coffee, Orange Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.   A phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.   He knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.Mike---"

That number has been higher, as much as 90% for certain=\r=20\rmonths or when we are trying something new or moving a particular product. =\r=20\rAlso, as Bid/Ask spreads tighten, which we would expect, that bodes well fo=\rr=20\rEOL and our (and the markets) ability to transact even more quickly. =20\rTransactions that took days to put together now can be done in 1 second. =\r=20\rBetween the speed and the cost savings of having a fully integrated system,=\r=20\rwe believe that our transaction numbers and percentages of online business=\r=20\rwill significantly increase.\r Changes in the industry\rWe discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry.   We see=20\rseveral things on the horizon.   We expect the acceptance of the online=20\rtransactions to further increase; especially with the volatile price=20\rmovements what we have seen in the last 6 months.   We are currently=20\rdeveloping several new products for EOL that I believe will become very=20\rpopular and will create new markets in coal and related sectors.   I don't=\r=20\rwant to discuss them right now but we are close to releasing them and I thi=\rnk=20\rthey will raise some eyebrows.   The development of the Global Coal exchan=\rge=20\rwill also help.   I frankly don=01,t believe it will be very successful beca=\ruse=20\rof several things but primarily because of the difficulty in closing the=20\rtransaction. One thing has been very firmly demonstrated.   Every time a new=\r=20\rbig system has been introduced EOL volumes go up.   It simply accelerates th=\re=20\racceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and=20\rliquidity to see who will ultimately win the day.   Another big change in th=\re=20\rindustry is the growing acceptance of the OTC market.   The significant pric=\re=20\rchanges that have occurred have \"forced\" many traditional players to the OT=\rC=20\rmarket.   This also includes forcing them to agree to standard OTC terms and=\r=20\rconditions and getting them comfortable with the market.   This is very good=\r=20\rfor Enron especially when you consider that we are the major player on the=\r=20\rOTC market.   We don't release specific percentages of what we are doing on=\r=20\rthe OTC.   Also having more natural and traditional players signing these=20\rtypes of standard agreements helps us on the EOL side because standard=20\rcontracts are important for developing a more liquid commodity market.\r Enron coal volumes\rA couple of numbers that we are willing to release.

To reiterate, the key commercial risk issues are:1)   Tax---Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the qualifications of the Pacificorp machines.   Thorough due dilligence will be required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling applications.2)   Syndication---Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find monetizers.   Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.   Realistically, we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we can shed our ownership.   Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in as 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the former owner staying in the game.3)   Operations---The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the equity.   Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an operator.   For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.   We will guide the monetizers to this risk.   If we have to indemnify them in this area, we will need to better understand the available insurance products.4)   Marketing---This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.   The desk believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over the next 12-18 months.   We have put $6.000/ton into the model, and the desk will buy $3.000/ton today for seven years.   The current market is anywhere from $1.000-3.000/ton.   We have also developed a list of strong sites that are looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or marketing agreements.The economics of the deal are compelling.   We put out $1000mm to Pacificorp as an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).   We collect $30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity origination.Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure around the risks.   The decision we need from senior management is whether this is a game we want to play.   The machines fit into the letter of the law.   Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined in the reindeer games.   We can put on the position we want by bridging this deal.On the flip side, people have heartburn over \"spirit of the law\" issues and those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this week whether to put resources on it.   We can back out later (our commitment so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.Please let me know your thoughts.Regards,Dan\n"

I didn't over focus on specific wording and I am not sure how you want to address the various groups that will be affected.   I believe we need to address all of them by name and they should probably be in alpha order as to not upset anyone on the order.I also didn't know any other information that you may want to include with regard to the successes from the group year to date.   Greg, Jeff and I are getting together for lunch tomorrow to discuss the New Works organization.   I think that this should come from Enron's office of the Chairman vs. the business units because it does affect 2 different lines of business and it will have more impact and clarity for the other groups especially, my departure from Net Works.After you guys pretty this up (and destroy it) please send it back via email and i'll make sure and coordinate with Whalley.Thanks,Mike\n"

ShawnPS.   the following is an interesting article about the online intermodal landscape.Hashing Out E-commerce.JOHN GALLAGHER10/23/2000 Traffic World Page 29 Copyright 2000 Gale Group Inc. All rights reserved. COPYRIGHT 2000 Journal of Commerce, Inc. 'Dot-coms' explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among themselves With some 150 websites devoted to transportation, e-commerce companies acknowledge that it's difficult for potential customers to cut through the confusion and figure out who's doing what and who's going to be with them for the long term. Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners, one of the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between Arzoon and Freightwise. There has been speculation that after Freightwise was established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, four competitors --- Union Pacific Railroad, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway --- teamed up with rival e-commerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSF's proposed merger with Canadian National Railway. However, both Freightwise and Arzoon claim that's not the case. \"I'm continually asked, 'What's up with the four railroads and Arzoon?'\" said Charley Eisele, UP senior vice president, strategic planning. \"People are trying to make a whole lot out of the coincidence of these two things from a timing perspective. The reality is, it was a decision made on the underlying business model.\" Freightwise executives agree with that assessment, pointing out that because the industry happened to be divided along merger lines at the same time the railroads were aligning with e-commerce initiatives, it seemed too much of a coincidence that the same four railroads opposing the merger were the ones joining Arzoon. However, \"I think to launch a company like this takes more than just a reaction to a merger,\" said Freightwise Chief Marketing Officer Sanjay Joshi. There are major differences between the two Internet companies starting with their business plans. Arzoon categorizes itself as a \"shipper-centric transportation management system,\" whose target market is the roughly 80 percent of the transportation business that currently moves under contract. Freightwise, on the other hand, classifies itself as a transportation exchange and is targeting the remaining 20 percent of the market procured on a spot basis. Arzoon, whose primary focus is the shipper, is setting out to help manage the relationships that already exist between shipper and carrier. The priority for carrier-focused Freightwise is to make sure the capacity is there for shippers who log on to their system. In addition, Arzoon, which currently is involved only with rail and truck, wants eventually to become a transportation management system that \"manages across all modes and borders,\" including ocean and air freight, said Eisele. Freightwise will stick to truckload and inter-modal for the time being. \"We're not sure about getting involved with air freight, given the size of the market and the economics,\" said Joshi. \"It takes a different set of products and economics than surface transportation. Maybe sometime down the line, but right now we really plan on getting entrenched in the truckload and inter-modal spot market. We think that's a lot to chew. The key is to focus on a particular footprint that we can begin to own rather than get too broad and lose focus.\" The fact that Arzoon and Freightwise have teamed up with different rail carriers is another cause for concern. Will there be a disincentive on the part of carriers to use each others' e-commerce initiatives and ultimately, therefore, a disadvantage for prospective customers? \"The answer is the 90-10 rule,\" said a source from an Arzoon rail partner. \"A particular shipper is in a position where 90 percent of their business is conducted via truck and other modes, and maybe only 10 percent via railroads. If the choice presented to them is to select a system that addresses all modes effectively or one that only addresses a particular mode, then the 90-10 rule would suggest that greater leverage would lie in picking the broader, multimode transportation management system. In that case, even though a railroad may have another (e-commerce) approach, it would clearly have to respond to the customers' needs in that situation.\" Freightwise's Joshi makes a similar argument. \"Freightwise is merely another channel for BNSF to market its services,\" he said. \"It posts a certain set of rates for what it believes to be fair for the service. It's not for Freightwise to decide what rates BNSF decides to move through its channel.\" UP may not decide to post its rates on Freightwise, Joshi said, \"so then BNSF would have to find out what's the competitive rate relative to UP.\" Another question arises as to whether Arzoon may have a competitive advantage over Freightwise, particularly from an intermodal standpoint, because it is backed by both Eastern and Western carriers. whereas Freightwise is backed only by BNSF. \"I would only say that the partnership we have with BNSF is not exclusive and that we're talking to other railroads as well,\" Joshi noted. He added, \"This is an exchange to market your capacity and services. It would be very difficult for six railroads to do something on their own; there would be no critical mass. It's to the advantage of the other railroads to participate.\" Along with BNSF, which provides Freightwise with instant capacity, the company recently signed GE Corp. as an \"anchor tenant\" and equity investor that will help Freightwise reach the critical mass Joshi talks about. As both a major supplier to the rail industry (locomotives) and a potential shipper (appliances), \"the goal is to use GE as something we can leverage, and work with their respective divisions as a way to reduce their transportation costs,\" he said. Visibility is a key advantage for potential customers of both Interment companies. \"As a transportation management system with access to all modes, it allows shippers to be more efficient in the management of transportation,\" Eisele said. \"Cross-modal visibility means that because they'll be managing their truck business under the same system as rail, the economics of rail will be much more visible. And we believe that with comparable reliability, the economics will be compelling to the point where rails will garner a greater share of those customers' total transportation buy.\" Joshi claims a big difference between Freightwise and other exchanges is that when a shipper is looking for transportation options between specific origin-destination pairs, Freightwise allows customers to make side-by-side comparisons between truck and intermodal. It is this price and service transparency, Joshi says, that will save its customers money: \"We're giving customers three to five choices between truck and intermodal, not 50, so that they can see service and price parameters.\" Intermodal e-commerce ventures such as Freightwise also bring up the question of competition with traditional intermodal marketing companies. Joshi points out that its fee for doing a lot of what small and midsize IMCs do currently --- such as load matching, tracking and tracing and order processing --- is 3 percent, which is split between the buyer and seller of the services. This compares to the 18 to 20 percent that customers traditionally have paid for retaining an IMC. \"I don't think all brokers will embrace us,\" Joshi conceded, but at the same time, \"there will be a segment of brokers who will begin migrating into higher-added-value services, for example, the third-party logistics side rather than the classical brokerage. They'll get into things like inventory management on behalf of shippers and leave back-end processing to firms like Freightwise.\" Webmodal, which is a purely intermodal e-commerce venture whose vision is to \"make intermodal much more like truck in the eyes of the shipper,\" points out that it can take customers several days to receive a bid from a traditional IMC. \"We can immediately configure door to door intermodal solutions that we can put together using our underlying carrier relationships,\" said Webmodal founder and CEO Chris Kravas. \"We do business with a lot of large U.S. railroads and with 37 drayage companies. We give everybody access to all the information they might need to make decisions on price vs. service tradeoffs, and which carriers make most sense based on what the shipper is trying to do. And we do it without the traditional one-to-three-day wait that typically happens in response to a normal request for (intermodal services).\" Kravas said the company has invested time and expertise in developing what it calls a \"first-ever\" schedule engine that works door to door. \"Traditionally, the industry hasn't had a schedule engine that involves the 'dray-plus-rail-plus-dray' services, so there's been pretty much a reliance on rules of thumb. But the truth is, it doesn't take anywhere near eight days for most origin-destination pairs. We have a very robust way of representing the capabilities of the dray carriers as well as the rail carriers, so that much more truck-like transit can be shown to be viable.\" Because of this, Webmodal sees itself as more of a technology and e-commerce company than a traditional IMC, and considers itself more a vendor than a competitor. How does a small or midsize IMC work as a customer of Webmodal? \"Not all small IMCs are set up to do business with all of the railroads or with a large set of drayage companies,\" Kravas said. \"What we do for them is give them a low-cost way to access, a comprehensive array of intermodal products and services available in the U.S. We've established ourselves as a business partner with a large base of first-rate drayage companies across the country. So if you're an IMC with an opportunity to handle freight in a new market, Webmodal allows you to put together a service and pay only a modest fee.\" Kravas wouldn't disclose the company's fee structure, only that it charges per shipment for a web-based order and a \"slightly higher\" fee for a phone or fax order. A smaller IMC also could use Webmodal to put in place a private version of its technology that would enable the IMC to better manage its business. \"That would range from pricing, order fulfillment, customer service --- kind of the whole spectrum of capabilities that would allow an IMC to take advantage of our system,\" Kravas said. Everyone's waiting to see who's going to survive the transportation dot-com fallout. Before that happens, however, Freightwise may find itself as big a competitor with Arzoon as it is with a company like Webmodal. \"We're starting from different points,\" said Freightwise's Joshi, \"but down the line, yes, I can see\" more head-to-head competition between the two companies. In addition to establishing itself in that 80 percent of the market devoted to transportation contracts, UP's Eisele notes that Arzoon also has a catalog-capability function, which eventually can be used to auction capacity in the spot market --- the market in which Freightwise is establishing itself. \"We will very much have the capability to enable spot market buying,\" he said. As Webmodal's Kravas pointed out, \"It's going to be an interesting next six months.\" Arzoon-A.T. Kearney partnership Consulting firm A.T. Kearney, a unit of Dallas-based EDS, and Arzoon, which provides Internet-based services for managing transportation work processes worldwide, have formed a strategic alliance. A.T. Kearney was one of the first to establish a dedicated practice helping shippers manage transportation more effectively on a global basis. Its clients now will have direct exposure to Arzoon's transportation management trading network, which provides online services for managing the full life cycle of work processes across all modes, systems and enterprises. Similarly, Arzoon and its clients can access \"select\" A.T. Kearney consulting services, the company said. That includes inbound transportation management, supply-chain and distribution rationalization, carrier selection and process improvement, Arzoon said.\"Superior transportation management has emerged as a critical success factor in the increasingly competitive world of commerce,\" said Randy Garber, transportation services co-leader of A.T. Kearney's operations services practice. \"We think service companies, manufacturers and retailers that incorporate the speed, simplicity and efficiency of the Internet into their supply chains will lead their markets.\" The plan is for both A.T. Kearney and Arzoon to gain valuable understanding and insights into how the Internet creates great efficiencies in both the strategic and tactical needs of transportation professionals, Garber added. \"We believe that the knowledge gained from this collaboration will benefit our clients as well as Arzoon's customers involved in the $1 trillion global freight transportation market,\" Garber said. An Arzoon official said the company was \"very pleased\" to be associated with A.T. Kearney, which Arzoon described as a \"premier problem-so1ver.\" A.T. Kearney has a global presence that includes 62 offices in 37 countries. Arzoon.com, San Mateo, Calif., is a year-old Internet startup that describes itself as a company that is working on \"the transformation of the worldwide transportation market into a networked community.\"Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying   by China, soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.   You said something very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the airport.   You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by yourself.   I can certainly understand that.   I seem to have a l lot of that on this trip.   I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out trick or treating.   I bet they look great.As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality and realize just how lucky we really are.   I turned to Ken Rice at the ceremony yesterday and said, \"What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, breaking a barrel of saki in front of 3000 Japanese executives and TV.   The Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is out of a job on a no confidence vote last night.   (Really bad luck for Enron here) I would have liked to have met him.   Actually, the ceremony was neat and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.   You should see me in a Happy coat.   I'll explain when i get home.   Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even imagining what are lives are like today?   We are so blessed.   Even more than that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and wondering why God let me find you so many years ago.   I must have been a priest in a former life.Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this airplane.   Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.   Although I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the internet.I love you and miss you very much.Eternally,MichaelSee you soon and in time for soccer.xxoo\n"

I have a request that I wondered if you could help with.Perez Companc - a big oil and gas company in Argentina - is trying tounderstand how some of the big US companies are dealing with IT. Basicallyinterested in issues such as sourcing arrangements, structure(centralized/decentralized/distributed), customer relationships, use ofpackaged software, 'e' issues, and such like. They want me to try to set upmeetings with some key US companies here in Houston. Among the companieswhich I suggested they talk to is yours. Do you think someone/some groupwould be willing to talk to a contingent of Perez Companc folks? WouldEnron be willing to share things which weren't consideredcompetitive secrets with them??? They were hoping to come up either thefirst or second week in March. My role is to try to put together visits tothe Shell/Texaco JV, Shell, Texaco, Exxon-Mobil, Conoco, BHP, Enron,Chevron. Do you think it is possible? Again, nothing of a competitivenature has to be offered, they just are trying to determine what they oughtto be doing with respect to IT.Thanks in advance.---Rudy Hirschheim***   Rudy Hirschheim   Tenneco/Chase International Chair &amp; Professor of Information Systems   C.T.

He joined us around the middle of the year, so we did not have much data when we conducted our mid-year review.He is an entrepreneur with strengths in logistics and systems.   He has both technical and commercial backgrounds.During this year, he used is background in logistics and management to identify $1.8MM in recurring annual savings for Ventane, one of Enron's businesses in Venezuela.I had initially placed him with Dan Reck because of Antonio's background in logistics.   However, it appears that Dan is more interested in bringing on people with a background in trading, which is not Antonio's strength.I encourage you to closely examine his resume and I appreciate any good ideas.I'm also looking forward to getting together with you soon.Many thanks.   Shawn\n"
