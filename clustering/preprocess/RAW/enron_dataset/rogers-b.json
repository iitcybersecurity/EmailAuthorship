They will be comfortable enough to bid this weekand don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;other peakers together; LV Cogen.* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement costplus a premium and discounted cash flow.

They want to see if we have anything to offer.   In the meantime, they will go forward with their RFP.Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.   The local distribution company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmmbtu on a variable or usage basis.   10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.   Peoples gas aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and purchases gas month to month.   RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month to month.We would need to add 15 cents/mmmbtu to gas price from our curves.Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-25000 is $17MM.   They break this out to $111.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM engineering cost, $4000k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 3000# so we need to have a calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 3000 to 6000.   My guess is that it will be around $1mm.I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.   We can use the routine 2 page proposal format.\n"

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated --- time and time again --- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last line of defense? Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's \"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech.\" While he was extolling the virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida --- from Bill Daley to Jesse Jackson --- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me --- a darker, more sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a difficult task. Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the Constitution. The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I mean? Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. \"Oh, Farah,\" you say, \"you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results in any way with the whole world watching, do you?\" Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: \"More than 1000 million Americans voted on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next president of the United States.\" They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush campaign's playbook. The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional authority --- Vice President Al Gore.

The download time is usually several minutes to ahalf hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully printout on our systems.   Two of our consultants have experienced similardifficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are notunique to systems at PECO.We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability tobid on the assets.

The bid specifications indicate liquidated damages in the amount of $2,375,000 PER DAY.   I assume Enron will not accept damages at this level.   Please check to determine if the bid will be qualified in this area-and what alternative damages may be offered.   Due to the unusual size of the penalty relative to the contract value, this could have an impact on reinsurance.The contract indicates a normal one year warrenty from the contractor.   The charge for this warrenty is included in our standard performance bond rate.   I have bonded a number of generator contracts similar to this, and frequently there is an option for the contractor to offer an extended warrenty up to 5 years.   Since this would impact the premium charged, you may want to check to see if this option exist so we can get the pricing correct in your estimate.Thanks.3/8/000Philip N.

According to the company, \"The deal fitsboth companies exceptionally well.

We are still under several different CA's with them, due to our past conversation's regarding generation.   With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion   Project, but at that time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the delivery of the turbines.   In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation business, this JV would give them the perfect \"exit strategy\".   Also, it would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other parties.   I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth story to Wall Street. If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.   Thanks!   Ben\n"

Your potted plants stay alive.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;2. Having   sex in a twin sized bed is absurd.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;3. You   keep more food than beer in the fridge.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;4.   6:000 AM is when you get up, not when you go to   sleep.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   5. You hear your favorite song on   an elevator.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;6. You carry an umbrella. You   watch the Weather Channel.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   7. Your friends   marry and divorce instead of hookup   and&lt; &lt; &lt;   breakup.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;8. You go from 130 days of   vacation time to 7.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   9. Jeans and a sweater   no longer qualify as 'dressed up'.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;10. You're   the one calling the police because those darn   kids&lt; &lt; &lt;   next door don't   know how to turn down the stereo.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;111.   Older relatives feel comfortable telling sex jokes   around&lt; &lt; &lt;   you.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;12. You don't know what time Taco   Bell closes anymore.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;13. Your car   insurance goes down and your car payments go   up.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;14. You feed your dog Science Diet   instead of McDonald's.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;15. Sleeping on the   couch makes your back hurt.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;16. You no   longer take naps from noon to 6 p.m.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;17.   Dinner and a movie - The whole date instead of   the&lt; &lt; &lt;   beginning of   one.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;18. MTV News is no longer your   primary source for&lt; &lt; &lt;   information.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   19. You go to the drugstore   for Ibuprofen and antacids,   not&lt; &lt; &lt;   condoms and   pregnancy test kits.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;20. A $4.000 bottle of   wine is no longer 'pretty good stuff,'&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   21.   You actually eat breakfast foods at breakfast   time.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;222. Grocery lists are longer than   macaroni &amp; cheese,   diet&lt; &lt; &lt;   Pepsi &amp;   Ho-Ho's.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;23. \"I just can't drink the way I   used to\" replaces \"I'm&lt; &lt; &lt;   never going to drink that much again.\"&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;24.   Over 90% of the time you spend in front of a computer   is&lt; &lt; &lt;   for real   work.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;25.

Here are the results of my conversation:1.   Entergy Project---I told Jay that our immediate interest would be to purchase the Jackson project with the outside tolling bid in place.   Given their immediate focus is to finalize the tolling agreement for the project, he suggested that we revisit this topic in 3 months.   He sounded a bit nervous.   Perhaps there is an opportunity to swoop in later.2.   ECAR Projects---Because these projects are 4th and 5th in their cue, he would like to discuss our involvement at a later date.3.   7FA versus 7EA turbines---It turbines out that KN's Illinois turbines are 7EAs (six of them).   I told him that we would still be interested in making a joint venture proposal for the turbines to them.   He is going to have Chuck Walker from his Chicago office call me. \n"

They were very interested with regards to potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.   Enron could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year through year 15 or 20.   We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and Michigan.   They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling agreements in place for those projects.   The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product.

It shows O&amp;M cost estimates for a 20 year period assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant from the Owner &amp; Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what they plan to \"charge\" us for the O&amp;M portion of the power they provide us during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the water treatment part). Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our proforma purposes.If LES is to provide what they feel the O&amp;M would be, please let me in on their numbers so we can provide our experience.thanks, Scot\n"

The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.   This would be obtained viaa 1444A Bond offering without any subdebt.2.   There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:Management fee ($6000k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&amp;M Fee ($3000k/yr)to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services (\"TPS\") and the TPSParts Company for a spare engine.   The TPS Spare engine may be eliminatedprovided we can get comfort via other methods.   The financing fees wereestimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.3.   The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours ofthe plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&amp;MOperator).   This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimatingthat this plant will never reach a major outage.I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.Regards,Patrick SmithTM Power Ventures\n"

As you already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys lose these assets to legal issues.   I know we both can come to some middle ground before people lose their patience.   My only advice, for what its worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.

      "body": "\nCharlie: It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business School information session.   As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron.   Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.   I am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of transaction with you guys.   It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that we might be interested in.   If you could send me a business proposal or summary of what your doing, that would be helpful.   With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not get in due to my GMAT score.   I decided to take a graduate level finance class this summer, which I received an A.   I am currently taking another graduate finance class this semester.   I am also retaking the GMAT, with the hopes of increasing my quantitative score.   Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.   I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to improve on was my GMAT score.   Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my continued interest with Columbia.   I hope that these actions will help me get into Columbia this year.   My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their network, location, reputation and curriculum.   Since growing up in Pelham,   it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while. As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.   I hope this brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into Columbia.   I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the Woodlands or downtown.   Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.Regards,Ben Rogers\n"

In terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.   These guys will cover the site visits the next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.   While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.   Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per day. I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling please give me a call.   Again, thank you for your help with these issues.Regards,Ben\n"

That guy down at the end of the bar calls his &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Snickers, &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;because; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;'It really Satisfies.'\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;The customer looks dumbfounded so the bartender tells him he &lt;will &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;give &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;him &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;a second to think it over. &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;So the customer turns to the man sitting to his left who is &lt; &lt; &lt; sipping &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;on a &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;beer and asks, \"Hey bud, what's the name of your penis?\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;The man looks back with A smile and says, \"TIMEX.\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;The thirsty customer asks, \"Why Timex?\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;The fella proudly replies, \"Cause it takes a lickin' andkeeps &lt;on &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;tickin!\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;A little shaken, the customer turns to the fella on his right &lt; &lt; &lt; who's &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;sipping on a fruity margarita. \"So, what do you call your &lt;penis?\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;The man proudly exclaims, \"FORD, because quality is Job1.\" He &lt;then &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;adds, &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;\"Have you driven a Ford, lately?\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;Even more shaken, the customer has to think for a moment &lt;before &lt;he &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;comes &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;up with a name for his penis. He turns to the bartender and &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;exclaims, &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\"The &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;name of my penis is Secret.

They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000's as possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000's per plant.   With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave them the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000 per turbine.   Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them - 1st Qtr. '01.   If they are still interested they will get back with me with a non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks.   Please let me know if you have any comments.   Thank you!Ben\n"

I was trying to get an A in the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.   That said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly appreciate it.   I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.   Thanks for making the class educational and quite enjoyable.

Kinder/Morgan brings the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, trading and operating expertise.   I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work togther with regards to the trading.   I am sending you an anayst report I just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.

They are able to run in at peak, swing and base load levels very easily.   They are looking for a 3 year   term deal for 510 MW's, with $1.000 VOM and Heat Rate of 8,531 located in Little Rock, ARK...   Pricing starts June 02 and goes to Cal. 04.   Anyway, I want to know if you guys are able to meet tomorrow at 2:000pm to talk about pricing up this deal.   It should only take about 15-25 minutes.   Thanks for your time.Regards,Ben3-79998\n"

Consistent with these objectives and with the=\r=20\rcorporate goal of fostering =01&amp;One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=\re=20\rfollowing organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=\r=20\rCommercial Transactions Group within ENA.\r 1) Coverage/Origination:\r To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=\r=20\rtechnology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20\rbusinesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=\r=20\runder the leadership of Dave Delainey :\ra) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=\r=20\rco-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;\rb) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=\r=20\rbroad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20\rincluding   pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=\rd=20\rmining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=\r=20\rtextiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20\rCoverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.\r Downstream Coverage/Origination\r As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=\rt=20\rthe heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=\r=20\rENA and Enron Corp.   Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=\r=20\rits industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20\rsolutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=\r=20\rCorp.   Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=\r=20\rwill expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=\rgy=20\rcommodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=\res=20\rbut also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=\rals,=20\rplastics and refined products risk management capability.   These additional=\r=20\rcapabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=\r=20\rgroups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=\r=20\rwill be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20\rleadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=\r=20\rsub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:\ra) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=\r=20\ractivities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=\ror=20\rthe provision of innovative=20\rproducts and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=\rn=20\rof paper risk management products;\rb) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=\ro=20\rlead the coverage activities in this business.   This group will be=20\rresponsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20\rchemicals and refined products industries;\rc) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=\r=20\rTrust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=\r the=20\rcoverage activities in this business.   This group will be responsible for t=\rhe=20\rprovision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20\rheavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=\rs=20\rand glass manufacturing industries.\r   Midstream Coverage/Origination\r a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=\rn=20\renergy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20\rutilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=\r=20\rInterconnect. We have asked   Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=\rs=20\rgroup;\rb) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =\ron=20\renergy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20\rutilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=\ry=20\rwill also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20\ropportunities in the Western U.S.   We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=\r=20\rleadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20\rCalgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=\rs;\rc) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=\rocus on=20\rthe provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20\remerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=\rhant=20\rpower generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =\r=20\rMike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.   In addition, Mike will=\r=20\rcontinue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20\rInterconnect;\rd) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=\ring=20\ropportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20\rrestructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.   We hav=\re=20\rasked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20\rformerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=\r=20\rCitizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=\r=20\rthis newly formed business.\r 2) Commercial Transactions:=20\r The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20\rDonahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=\r=20\rtransactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=\recuting=20\rtransactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=\r=20\rof client coverage.   CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20\rDevelopment, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20\rStructuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=\r=20\rAnalysis and Upstream Asset Management.\r The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=\r=20\rexecution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=\r=20\rwith the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=\r=20\rwhich will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.   This=\r=20\rdedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=\r=20\rand greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20\rresources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=\r=20\rthe highest value transactions across the coverage functions:\r a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=\r=20\rWestern Coverage/Origination Groups.   The senior members of this group=20\rinclude Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=\r=20\rLemmons joined Enron in 19992.   Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=\r=20\rCapital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=\r=20\rfrom Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20\rorigination.\rb) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=\rial=20\rorigination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20\rEnvironmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=\r=20\restablished.   The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=\r=20\rBoudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.   We anticipate announcing=\r=20\rtwo to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.\rc) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=\r=20\rServices and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.   The seni=\ror=20\rmembers of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=\rnd=20\rJohn House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 19996. Most recently, he was the=\r=20\rVice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.   We=\r=20\ranticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=\r=20\rweeks.\rd) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20\rFinance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.   The senior members of this team inclu=\rde=20\rBrad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.   We hope to announce the addition=\r=20\rof at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.\r Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=\r=20\rDownstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=\r=20\rresponsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.   Andrea Reed will=\r=20\rcontinue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=\r=20\rcommercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=\rl=20\rresponsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20\rCapital Structuring Group.   The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=\rn=20\rlargely unchanged.   In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20\rDevelopment teams and their respective origination groups will be located=\r=20\rtogether.\r We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=\re=20\rand industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=\ral=20\rmarkets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=\ren=20\rthe Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20\r Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=\rth=20\rAmerica by working with us to implement these changes.\r\n"

Dean is answering the other one and will send back to you directly.* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?   PG&amp;E isconcerned about any potential requirements that they might be required toeither purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:   scheduling coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.   We are also flexible re the time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.   Whatever arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.* What is status of EPC negotiations.   Will they be required to engageNEPCO as the EPC contractor?   Does the EPC contractor have control over theturbines?RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.   Contract has not been executed, but has been \"put on the shelf\" awaiting decision on successful bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.   Successful bidder and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.   o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.   o West LB has control of the turbines.   They can be assigned either to the LLC or to ENA.   (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)   If assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   * They also questioned whether there would be any \"agriculturalrestrictions\"?RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.   Last week, the Kern County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.   However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.   (The Governor has until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)   The cancellation will be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson Act cancellation fee.\n"

If so, will it be in place and transfer withPEF?Answer:   We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.   The maintenance reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in thecapital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through themaintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?Answer:   The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for the overhaul.\n"

It was adjusted from Lowell, Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match   Homestead form.Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:Homestead had dual fuel   +4MHomestead had additional piling and foundation bulks   +1.8MHomestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5MHomestead had an FPL substation   +5MHomestead did not need as much gas pipeline   -2.1MHomestead used 6% margin   +4.4MHomestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling   +1.5% (not capital cost but does change $/kW)Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of million.Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. These summaries should not be passed around.Bruce\n"

After meeting with many of the faculty and staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison &amp; Ronn) at the School, my desire to attend the School is quite strong.   The School is a perfect fit for the career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my experiences with Enron.   Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. Enron).   I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.   Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in Texas, such as myself.   Regards,Ben Rogers\n"

These guys mainly care about the gas pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to increase throughput.   These plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development.   Their only operational plants are in Colorado.   They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.   If you guys offered to buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines.

Though I am disappointed with the results I am still determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.   I understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, etc. that this would compensate for my disability.   After talking with Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was the right place to get the education I was looking for.   I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year.   I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the graduate level. I also plan on retaking the GMAT test.   Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.   I would like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you.   If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.   Take care and hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,Ben Rogers\n"

We are looking at taking a company public which I may go work for if I can get enough equity in the deal.   The other thing that might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position than I am at now, which would be great, but I would be in Ohio, boo.   That way Megan and I could buy a house and potential go and get an executive MBA from Kellog, but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out I would be amazed.   My golf game is ok, but my training is starting to get better.   I did see that none of us made the NYC Marathon on the first go around.   Did you see that Jon and Kati had their baby-I didn't even know she was pregnant.   Shit were getting old!!!   Hope all is going well and I'll see ya.Ben\n"

I enjoyed meeting you last year and talking with   you regarding the curriculum and admissions process.   I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in attending the Business School.   I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class (Financial Management), which I received an A.   I was very pleased with myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.   I have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking and runs through December.   I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try and receive a \"special testing status\" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision. As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to increase my application profile.   I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris, who heads up the admissions process   to inform him of these recent developments.   Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look forward to hearing from you soon Regards,Ben RogersEnron Corp.P.S. David Martin says hello!\n"

M&amp;M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty scary.   If \"W\" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get together.   I will work on that when the time comes.   Besides, this election is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with all this contesting.   How is everything going?   What are you guys doing for the holiday?   Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver Creek - I'm praying for powder.   Again, I hope all is going well and I'll be better next time about getting back to you.   Good to hear from you!Ben\n"

I am also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in November.   So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough to arrange.

I walked Miguel through what I had done and how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and what you have said in the past.   I also gave them the numbers that the desk has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle case (5 year number).   From this they have modeled and graphed these different scenarios.   I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at this time.   Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions. ThanksBen3-79998\n"

I understand that it is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate for my disability.   After talking with you and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy-finance.   I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year.   I plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.   Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business.   Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.   It has been a pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future.   Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.   Take care and hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,Ben Rogers\n"

Good money but I would put off grad school a couple of years and by that time who knows, maybe night school at that time.   I am training for the MS 150, which is th 170 mile bike race to Austin.   And you call me fatty!!!   I'm heading the the Final Four next week - I ended up getting Mike Gioffre's Dad a couple of tickets, so he will in Indy.   OB and I went out to dinner in NYC when I was up their last week.   We went to a really expensive sushi place - it was awesome.   He seams to be doing well - he is considering going to a dot.com.   Gotta go!   I'll talk to you soon.Ben\n"

I was very pleased with myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.   I have also decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.   I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try and receive a \"special testing status\" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting to hear back from them with their decision.   When I hear back from GMAC, I am planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score. As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to increase my application profile.   Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Mike, what are your thoughts on my answer in O5?I'll provide start numbers for O5 later today.E2.   No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply (approximately 90 ppm NOx) which are well above the turbine emissions.T1.   \"on any asset\" should read \"of any asset\"O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per machine.   The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup progression.   The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 during the first run season.   General Electric replaced the generator under warranty provisions.   Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.   The CEMS certification was then postponed until Summer '01.O6.   Wasn't it a strip mine?

They are the \"preliminary answer\" to your question and should be treated as so. Please keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's capacity and efficiency, both from a new &amp; clean standpoint and an average degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,7000 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, gas fired @ baseload) --- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,5000,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at $175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, spares, etc, etc, etc)Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.Benjamin Rogers@ECT02/04/2000 09:39 AMTo: Scot Chambers/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc:   Subject: With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics regarding GE 7FA's.   Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 2 steam turbines; 3.   Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.   Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined cycle facility.

I understand that it is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability.   After talking with you and Professors Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right place to continue learning about energy-finance.   I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year.   I plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.   Due to my disability, this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the Admissions committment that I can do the work at The Texas University Graduate School of Business. Also, I would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an Energy-Finance Private Equity Fund at UT.   I know that with my industry-wide and investment banking contacts that I can help raise capital for the fund.   I am very interested in energy-finance and think that your idea is a very good.   Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.   It has been a pleasure to meet with you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future.   Also, if you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.   Take care and hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,Ben Rogers \n"

Feel free to=\r=20\rcall me (34292) if you still have any question.\r Yvan\r   1_   We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20\rLegitimate points of concern:=20\ra) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?\r   b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl=\ry=20\rbasis?\r Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index=\r=20\rand the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg=\rer=20\rfor the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with=\r)=20\ris a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant=\r=20\rcash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity =\rto=20\rdispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio=\rn=20\rof whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20\reconomically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20\rI would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20\rdispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its=\r=20\roperational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we=\r=20\ruse is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see=\r=20\rgraph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th=\re=20\rchances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow=\rn=20\rshould therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo=\rw=20\rthe real time prices pretty well.\r   2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in=\r=20\rthe south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to=\r=20\ruse the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20\r 4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20\rdaily vol as well, then the blending formula would be:\r'fvol =3D Sqr(((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1=\r5) /=20\r(jDate - jToday + 15)))\r with   jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch\r dblMvol the monthly vol\r dblDvol the daily vol\r 6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20\rconservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the=\r=20\rcorrelation goes from 30% to 70%.\r 7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20\rOrigination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations=\r=20\rexpenses between their numbers and those used by credits.\r 8_ The valuation model (coded by Alex Huang, Research) is based on a=20\rbidimensional tree, and therefore doesn=01,t use the SPRDOPT function. Howe=\rver,=20\rwe checked that the SPRDOPT function from the structuring model and the tre=\re=20\rbased model yielded the same values for the spread option.\r 9_ The strike for the spread option is the sum of the OIL price + the VOM.\r   ***=\r***\r***=\r***\r***888\r   Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see=20\rassociated with the heat rate spread option.   I want to make sure that I=20\runderstand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this val=\rue=20\rwould be booked.   As such, please provide the following detail:\r Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of=\r=20\rdaily call options?\rWhat power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?\rPlease send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to=\r=20\rvalue the deal?\rWhat volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities=\r=20\ror intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me=\r=20\rwhat formula you using to blend the two vols)?\rWhat expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th=\r=20\rof the relevant month, and for daily options?\rWhat correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?\rAre you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?\rAre you using the \"SPRDOPT\" Exotic Options function to value the option?\rAre you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?\rHas Don provided the fixed payment stream?
