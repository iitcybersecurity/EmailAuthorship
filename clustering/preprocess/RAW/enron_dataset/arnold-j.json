This invitation is extended to\ranyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=\rst=20\rtwo years.   These informal, interactive forums\rwill be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.\r Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=\r=20\rindicated a strong desire to express opinions, share\rideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20\rmandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.   They=\r=20\ralso afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=\rts=20\rexecutive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&amp;reality checks=018, =\rcreate a=20\r=01&amp;rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=\r =01&amp;same=20\rpage=018 about where Enron is going---and why.\r To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:\r Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.   Yo=\ru=20\rwill attend only one session.)\r ___ Thursday, March 29, 20001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:000 p.m. in EB50M\r ___ Friday, March 30, 20001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:000 p.m. in EB50M =20\r   The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:\r? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.\r? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.\r? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20\rpresentations.=20\r? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20\rquestions and express your own opinions.\r? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=\r.\r? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20\rlimited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&amp;A activitie=\rs,=20\rprojects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=\r=20\rvalues, etc.\r Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20\rencourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20\rintend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=\ro=20\rthe same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20\ryou RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 20001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20\rNowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20\r Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=\r=20\rsessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,\ras to what session you will attend.

Robert Shapiro, a managing director of Enron, the giant electricity marketer, says the California mess should in no way affect deregulation in other states, '''because California didn't really deregulate.''' Spencer Abraham, the new energy secretary, said Californians simply goofed, setting up a '''dysfunctional''' system. It is the way California deregulated, not deregulation itself, that should take the blame, they say.Yet some economists argue that California's troubles should inform the debate about whether --- not just how --- to deregulate. Among them is Alfred E. Kahn, the Cornell University economist who helped oversee the creation of free markets in the rail, trucking and airline industries. '''I am worried about the uniqueness of electricity markets,''' Mr. Kahn said. He is still studying whether the design flaws in California's market explain the whole problem. But he is sounding a note of skepticism. '''I've always been uncertain about eliminating vertical integration,''' he said, referring to the old ways of allowing a single, heavily regulated power company to produce, transmit and distribute electricity. '''It may be one industry in which it works reasonably well.''' Mr. Kahn's comments might sound a little heretical. When this former Carter administration official was pushing deregulation, it was still a novel and politically risky concept. Today, getting government out of most businesses is part of the Washington economic canon. Moreover, few people believe that California, the first state to overhaul its electricity sector from top to bottom, has proved a good laboratory. To satisfy interest groups, the markets were designed in an awkward way, which soured some deregulation experts on California before the first electron went on the auction block. Among the quirks: The state required utilities to buy nearly all their power on daily spot markets, rather than arranging long-term contracts that might have allowed them to hedge risk. Consumer prices were also fixed, making it impossible for utilities to pass on higher wholesale costs. Paul L. Joskow, an expert on electricity markets at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former student of Mr. Kahn's, remains hopeful that the kinks can be ironed out. In New England and the the Middle Atlantic states, as well in as Britain, Chile and Argentina, all places that have restructured electricity markets, regulators have had to adjust market rules to correct flaws. They have found ways to check the tendency of power sellers to exploit infant markets and charge high prices, Mr. Joskow said. Regulators have also had to establish new markets that, through price signals, encourage power companies to build enough generating capacity so that they have reserves for peak hours. During peak hours, shortages and price spikes can substantially raise average prices. '''If they can do it in Britain, Chile and Argentina, then I think we can do it here,''' Mr. Joskow said. Still, he warns that proper regulation requires tough political choices. Allowing high prices to pass through to consumers is one. Making sure Nimbyism does not prevent the construction of power plants is another. '''The political system must rise to the task,''' Mr. Joskow said, or the '''old way might be the best we can do.''' Mr. Kahn knows a bit about the old way. In the mid-1970's, he headed the New York Public Service Commission, which oversaw electricity and other regulated industries. The drawbacks were legendary. Local utilities had an endemic tendency to overestimate demand to justify new power plants, for which consumers paid through steady rate increases. Nearly everyone assumed that competition would slash prices. But though free markets do a better job managing rail, phone and airline prices, they have yet to match regulators' ability to juggle the complexities of electricity, Mr. Kahn said. Regulators tended to apply heavy political pressure on utilities to keep prices as low as possible and profit margins steady but thin. The vertical integration of electricity monopolies may have also had advantages, Mr. Kahn said. Engineers coordinated power plants and transmission lines in ideal ways. Planners who saw the need for new plants helped find a place for them to be built. '''The players all depended on one another,''' he said. California has probably not derailed deregulation efforts. But it has made people wonder anew whether market forces work for kilowatts as they do for widgets.Photo: Alfred E. Kahn Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The three men have been interviewed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and the White House was expected to announce next week that it will send their names to the Senate for confirmation, The Washington Times reported yesterday, quoting unidentified sources.But two Bush administration sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that President Bush has not made a decision and that the nominations were not a certainty. The Times said Gordon England, 63, who retired last week as a vice president at General Dynamics, would be nominated as Navy secretary. England was responsible for the company's information systems and international programs. The newspaper also said James Roche, 61, a vice president at Northrop Grumman, was the pick to head the Air Force. Roche, a retired Navy captain, worked in the State Department during the Reagan administration and later was Democratic staff director for the Senate Armed Services Committee. The nominee for Army secretary was said to be Thomas White, 57, a retired Army general and an executive with Enron, a Houston-based energy company. White was executive assistant to Secretary of State Colin Powell when Powell was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. NEWSEnron's Chief Denies Role as Energy Villain / Critics regard Kenneth Lay as deregulation opportunistDavid LazarusChronicle Staff Writer03/04/20001The San Francisco ChronicleFINALA1(Copyright 20001)Kenneth Lay is one of the energy \"pirates\" accused by California's governor of fleecing consumers. As chairman of Enron Corp., the world's largest energy trader, Lay is arguably the biggest, baddest buccaneer of them all. But that's not how he wants to be seen. And he certainly doesn't like taking knocks from Gov. Gray Davis for having contributed to California's energy mess.\"It's very unfair,\" Lay said, his brown eyes taking on a puppy- dog quality. \"He's trying to vilify us. But we didn't make the rules in California. We had nothing to do with creating the problem.\" He gazed out from his plush, 50th-floor office. Houston's downtown skyscrapers jutted like sharp teeth against the overcast sky. \"Everyone played by the rules,\" Lay said. \"Now our reputations are being maligned.\" In a sense, he's right. The ultimate blame does rest with California policymakers for deregulating the state's electricity market in such a ham-fisted way that power giants like Enron cleaned up by exploiting loopholes in the system. But Enron was no innocent bystander during the restructuring process. \"Enron and Ken Lay were one of the major players behind the push for deregulation in California,\" said Janee Briesemeister, senior policy analyst in the Austin office of Consumers Union. \"A lot of what's happening in California was their idea.\" Those familiar with the state's deregulation efforts said Enron was especially eager to ensure that a newly created Power Exchange, where wholesale power would be bought and sold, was separate from the Independent System Operator, which would oversee the electricity grid. \"This fragmented the wholesale market, making it harder to monitor,\" said John Rozsa, an aide to state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, widely regarded as the godfather of California's bungled deregulation measures. \"Enron isn't in the business of making markets work,\" Rozsa said. \"They're in the business of making a buck.\" In an ironic twist, however, Enron now could play a pivotal role in helping the state remedy past errors and find its energy footing. The company has that much clout. SEEKING LAY'S BLESSING Thus, as the governor pushes ahead with a scheme to purchase the transmission lines of California's cash-strapped utilities, he didn't hesitate to call recently seeking Lay's personal blessing for the plan. This must have been a sweet moment for the man who just weeks earlier had been castigated by Davis in the governor's State of the State speech. \"I told him we couldn't support it,\" Lay said, a hint of a smile playing across his lips. \"It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse.\" Why would Davis swallow his pride and court favor with Enron's big cheese? Simple: Davis will need the Bush administration's backing to make the power-line sale fly, and, many believe, there's no faster way to reach the new president than via the Houston office of his leading corporate patron. Lay, 58, and his company have donated more than $5000,000 to Bush's various political campaigns in recent years, and he placed Enron's private jet at Bush's disposal during the presidential race. So great is Lay's influence with the president that some insist he is now serving effectively as shadow energy secretary, shaping U.S. energy policy as he sees fit. \"There's a long history of Enron pulling the levers of its political relationships to get what it wants,\" said Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, a watchdog group. \"What Ken Lay thinks energy policy should be isn't very different from what George Bush and Dick Cheney think it should be.\" ANOTHER VIEWPOINT Lay, of course, sees things differently. At the mere mention of his close rapport with the president, his eyes glazed over and he mechanically recited the words he has repeated numerous times in recent months. \"I have known the president and his family for many years,\" Lay said. \"I've been a strong supporter of his. I believe in him and I believe in his policies.\" He insisted that reports of his having sway over Bush on energy matters are \"grossly exaggerated.\" Still, it is striking that Bush's quick decision after taking office to limit federal assistance in solving California's energy woes virtually mirrored Lay's own thoughts on the situation. So, too, with the administration's hands-off approach to resolving the crisis. Whatever else, California's power woes have been very kind to Enron's bottom line. The company's revenues more than doubled to $101 billion last year. They haven't hurt Lay, either. According to company records, his pay package more than tripled last year to $18.3 million. Lay and other Enron officials steadfastly refuse to break out the company's California earnings from other worldwide business activities. But Lay conceded that Enron's profit from California energy deals last year was \"not inconsequential.\" \"We benefit from the volatility,\" he said. CAPTIVE MARKETPLACE That's putting it mildly. It could be said that California's energy mess was tailor-made for Enron, which is almost uniquely positioned to prosper from a captive marketplace in which electricity and natural gas prices are simultaneously soaring skyward. To understand why that is, one must look closely at Enron's complex business model. The company is much more than just a middleman in brokering energy deals. Lay, with a doctorate in economics and a background as a federal energy regulator, set about completely reinventing Enron in 1985 after taking over what was then an unexceptional natural-gas pipeline operator. As he saw it, the real action was not in distribution or generation of energy, but in transacting lightning-fast deals wherever electricity or gas is needed --- treating energy like a tradable commodity for the first time. Enron is now the leader in this fast-growing field, and uses that advantage to consolidate its position as the market-maker of choice for energy buyers and sellers throughout the country. It also exploits its size and trading sophistication to structure unusually creative deals. For example, if electricity prices are down but natural gas prices up, Enron might cut a deal to meet a utility's power needs in return for taking possession of the gas required to run the utility's plants. Enron could then turn around and sell that gas elsewhere, using part of the proceeds to purchase low-priced electricity from another provider, which it ships back to the original utility. \"We do best in competitive markets,\" Lay said. \"These are sustainable markets.\" TRADING FRENZY Enron's trading floors buzz all day long with frantic activity as mostly young, mostly male employees scan banks of flat-panel displays in search of the best deals. Rock music blares from speakers, giving the scene an almost frat-party atmosphere. The company's trading volume skyrocketed last year with the advent of an Internet-based bidding system, which logged 548,000 trades valued at $3336 billion, making Enron by far the world's single biggest e-commerce entity. Kevin Presto, who oversees Enron's East Coast power trades, called up the California electricity market on his computer. With a few quick mouse clicks, he showed that Enron at that moment was buying power in the Golden State at $250 per megawatt hour and selling it at $275. \"Some days we're at $250, some days $3000 and some days $5000,\" Presto said over the steady thump-thump of the trading floor's rock 'n' roll soundtrack. \"There's truly a problem out there.\" This is a recurring theme among Enron officials: California's electricity market is broken and Enron would prefer it if things just settled down. As Lay himself put it, \"The worst thing for us is a dysfunctional marketplace.\" In reality, California's dysfunctional marketplace means Enron isn't just making piles of money, it's seeing profits both coming and going. LOTS OF BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA The company's energy services division, which handles the complete energy needs of large institutions, counts among its clients the University of California and California State school systems, Oakland's Clorox Co., and even the San Francisco Giants and Pac Bell Park. Enron purchases electricity on behalf of these clients from Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which by law must keep its rates frozen below current market values. At the same time, Enron sells power to PG&amp;E at sky-high wholesale levels. In other words, Enron is buying back its own electricity from PG&amp;E for just a fraction of the price it charges the utility. \"These guys are the pariahs of the power system,\" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. \"Why do we need middlemen? They don't do anything except mark up the cost.\" To be fair, energy marketers such as Enron can help stabilize an efficient marketplace by promoting increased competition between buyers and sellers. This has proven the case in Pennsylvania, where Enron actively trades among about 2000 market participants. But in an inefficient market such as California, a company like Enron can easily exacerbate things by exploiting loopholes in the state's ill-conceived regulatory framework. Sylvester Turner, a Houston lawmaker who serves as vice chairman of the state committee that oversees Texas utilities, said he can't blame Enron and other power companies for pursuing profits in California. \"California set up some bad rules, and these companies played by the rules California set up,\" he said. \"At the end of the day, they will behave to enhance their bottom lines.\" But as Texas proceeds toward deregulation of its own electricity market next year, Turner said he has learned from California's experience --- and is taking steps to prevent Texas' power giants from shaking down local consumers. LESSONS FROM GOLDEN STATE He has written a bill intended to give the Texas Public Utility Commission more authority in cracking down on market abuses. The power companies are fighting the legislation as hard as they can. Not least among Turner's worries is that Texas will see what California officials believe happened in their state: A deliberate withholding of power by leading providers until surging demand had pushed prices higher. \"I have that concern,\" he said. \"I don't necessarily take these companies at their word.\" For his part, Lay insists that Enron has never deliberately manipulated electricity prices. \"I don't know of any of that,\" he said. \"It's so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories.\" As a sign of Enron's commitment to solving California's energy troubles, Lay said he supported Davis when the state began negotiating long-term power contracts on behalf of utilities. So how many contracts has Enron signed? Suddenly, the hurt, puppyish expression vanished from Lay's face, and a harder, more steely look glinted from his eyes. \"None,\" he said. \"We won't be signing until we're certain about recovering our costs.\" Consider this a shot across California's bow.PHOTO; Caption: Chairman Kenneth Lay said Enron had \"nothing to do with creating the (energy) problem.\" Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved.SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yes, his business has profited handsomely from California's energy crisis, but Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay says he shouldn't be a scapegoat in California's energy crisis. That hasn't swayed Gov. Gray Davis, who has skewered energy companies such as Houston-based Enron for selling expensive power to California.\"Never again can we allow out-of-state profiteers to hold Californians hostage,\" Davis warned in his State of the State address. More recently, however, Davis called Lay to discuss negotiations as the state looks to buy power transmission lines from troubled utilities. \"I told him we couldn't support it,\" Lay told the San Francisco Chronicle in an interview at his Houston office. \"It will lead to an even less efficient transmission grid and, longer term, it could make things worse.\" Lay is not just any private-sector energy czar - Enron Corp. is the world's largest energy trader and Lay is a close friend of President George Bush. Lay and his corporation have donated more than $5000,000 to Bush's various political campaigns in recent years and he offered Bush use of Enron's private jet during the presidential race. But Lay said it's economics, not politics, that matter in California's energy crisis. And he thinks it unfair that Davis has blamed out-of-state energy brokers for the protracted problems. \"We didn't make the rules in California,\" Lay said. \"We had nothing to do with creating the problem.\" The problem, many analysts agree, began with the state's deregulation of the power industry in 19996. Enron encouraged deregulation, and the state's ensuing power crisis has been lucrative for the corporation. Enron's stock jumped 86 percent in 2000 and its revenues more than doubled to $101 billion. Lay, 58, was compensated accordingly - he received nearly $16 million in stock and cash beyond his $1.3 million salary last year, compared with less than $4 million in bonuses in 1999. Lay refused to say how much Enron has made off California's crisis, though he conceded the profit was \"not inconsequential.\" \"We benefit from the volatility,\" said Lay, who took over Enron in 1985 and has helped turn the corporation into a major player in the trading of electricity as a commodity. But Lay rejected suggestions that Enron has manipulated prices upward by insisting California pay dearly for last-minute power that has helped keep the lights on in recent months. \"I don't know of any of that,\" he said. \"It's so easy to conjure up conspiracy theories.\"Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

BUSINESSNET WORTHThe Stadium Curse? / Some stocks swoon after arena dealsKathleen Pender03/04/20001The San Francisco ChronicleFINALB1(Copyright 20001)Is buying the name of a big-league stadium the kiss of death for a company, or does it only seem that way? From Network Associates Coliseum in Oakland to the unfinished CMGI Field outside Boston, the nation is dotted with sports venues named after companies whose stocks have been sacked.The Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens play in a stadium named after PSINet, whose stock has fallen 92 percent to $1.25 a share since it bought naming rights. The problem names are not all tech. The owners of the TWA Dome in St. Louis and Pro Player Stadium in Miami are looking for new corporate sponsors because their current ones are bankrupt. TWA is an airline. Pro Player was part of underwear-maker Fruit of the Loom. The home of the Anaheim Angels could be in the market for a new name if Edison International, parent of electric utility Southern California Edison, runs out of juice. Of course, these companies were not in trouble when they promised to pay tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to have their names plastered on a ballpark or arena. In fact, many were at their peak. Which begs the question: Should investors get worried when a company in which they own stock puts its name up among the floodlights? Brian Pears, head of equity trading with Wells Capital Management, wonders if companies are susceptible to some weird strain of the \"Sports Illustrated curse.\" It seems as if any athlete who is pictured on the cover of SI magazine invariably loses his next game or pulls a groin muscle. Business celebrities suffer from a similar phenomenon: Amazon.com Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos was named Time magazine's 1999 person of the year just before his company's stock price tanked. Don Hinchey, who advises buyers and sellers in naming-rights deals, doesn't think the curse holds true in stadium and arena deals. \"You can make a case that a company is doing well when it acquires a naming rights sponsorship, but you can't necessarily say it corresponds with a peak in its business,\" says Hinchey, director of creative services for the Bonham Group in Denver. TRACKING NAMING FIRMS To find out if Hinchey is right, I tracked the stock market performance of publicly held companies since they bought naming rights to 47 big-league sports venues in North America. I excluded facilities named after subsidiaries of larger companies, including Miller Park in Milwaukee (Miller Brewing is part of Philip Morris) and Pac Bell Park in San Francisco (Pacific Bell is owned by SBC Communications, which is putting its own name on an arena in San Antonio). I used the announcement date as a starting point because stadium naming deals are, after all, marketing endeavors. The announcement of a deal generates tons of publicity, which is considered positive, even if the publicity is negative and even if the stadium won't open for several years. Then I compared each company's stock market performance with the Standard &amp; Poor's 5000 index during the same period. The bottom line: 29 of the 47 companies that bought stadium or arena names are trading at a higher stock price today than when the deals were announced, according to data from FactSet Research Systems. (Two companies each bought two names and were counted twice.) But --- and this is a big but --- only 13 of them beat the S&amp;P 5000 during the period since their respective deals were announced. So buying a stadium name might not be a curse, but it's no guarantee the company will beat the market. WINNERS, LOSERS The companies that have done best since buying a name come from a wide variety of industries. The biggest winner is Qualcomm, a wireless telecommunications company. Although its stock is down 65 percent from its peak, it's still up 746 percent since it agreed to slap its name on a San Diego stadium. The next-biggest winners include Target (discount stores), Ericsson (telecom equipment), Coors (beer), Fleet Financial (banking), Pepsi (soft drinks) and Enron (energy). The biggest losers are TWA, PSINet (Internet service provider), CMGI (Internet incubator), Savvis Communications (telecom services) and Network Associates (network security software). Network Associates' stock peaked about three months after it bought naming rights to the Oakland Coliseum in September 19998. Since then, it has suffered a string of setbacks. After the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned its accounting practices, it restated its financial results for 19997 and 19998. Its CEO resigned in December. Network Associates is paying slightly more than $1 million per year for the coliseum name. It can get out of its 10-year deal after five years. The company \"has been paying us,\" says Deena McClain, general counsel with the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority. \"We haven't had any discussions with them\" about changing the contract. Most naming-rights contracts have \"out clauses that allow the parties to extricate themselves if they want, can or need to in the event of financial difficulties or if a team moves,\" says Hinchey. Although nobody likes to be associated with a loser, stadium owners may benefit if a troubled company cuts out of a deal early. That's because stadium name prices have skyrocketed since the mid- 19990s, when $1 million a year --- give or take --- was average. In 1999, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to be named home of the Washington Redskins. In 2000, CMGI agreed to pay $1114 million over 15 years to have its name on the new home of the New England Patriots. It's questionable what kind of shape CMGI will be in when the stadium opens next year. The \"10-gallon hat of naming rights deals,\" says Hinchey, is in Houston, where Reliant Energy will pay $3000 million over 32 years to name the Astrodome and a new football stadium after itself. Some customers of Reliant's utility subsidiary were outraged when the deal was announced because the company was also raising electricity rates. Some shareholders also get perturbed when their company spends money on a stadium instead of a new plant or stock dividends. But Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues, says, \"you have to look at the (stadium) purchase in light of total marketing budget. It sounds like big money, but frequently it's over 20 to 30 years. If you take out things the company might buy anyway, like tickets and luxury suites, it's small potatoes.\" WHAT A DEAL IS WORTH The main benefit of a stadium deal is the exposure a company gets when a game is broadcast on TV or radio or mentioned in print. \"This is the biggest bang for your buck in terms of branding,\" says Jennifer Keavney, a Network Associates vice president who negotiated the stadium deal. She says the cost of her deal, about $1 million a year, \"won't even buy you a Super Bowl ad. It will buy five commercials on a nationally televised football game, maybe.\" The Coliseum, perched beside Interstate 8880, also acts like a giant billboard for the company, which frequently gets mentioned in traffic reports. Hinchey says most naming deals also include tickets and luxury boxes; on-site exposure through signage and kiosks; premium nights when the sponsor might offer samples at the park; and inclusion in programs, tickets and flyers. Most companies that strike stadium deals want to become a household name because they sell consumer products or services. But not always. 3Com sold nothing but corporate networking gear when it bought the name to Candlestick Park in San Francisco in 19995. \"It was a good move for them,\" says Jim Grinstead, editor of Revenues from Sports Venues. \"They got the employees they were looking for, the visibility they were looking for. At the time, they were a player in a crowded field, and they wanted to look like a fun place to work.\" Last April, 3Com extended its original 4-year contract for two more years. The biggest risk companies run is that the team that plays in their facility will be a loser. \"Companies invest in an entity that can enhance their brand, their sales and hospitality efforts. Certainly that loses its luster if the team is not performing well,\" Hinchey says. \"But corporations realize the team's success on the field fluctuates. It could be a champion one year, next year in the dumps.\" The same can be said about the corporate sponsors, which is something stadium owners --- be they taxpayers or business tycoons --- must realize when they sell a name.PHOTO; Caption: Rich Gannon of the Oakland Raiders scored in Oakland's Network Associates Coliseum last year. / Frederic Larson/The Chronicle 2000 Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

In=\r=20\r1986 they acquired gas properties from Peoples Natural Gas of Omaha and got=\r a=20\rtwo-person gas-trading operation as part of the deal. That little trading=\r=20\roperation, now a subsidiary called Aquila, turned into something almost as=\r=20\rvaluable as all the rest of the company, with its 4,5000 megawatts of power=\r=20\rgenerated in some 222 power plants around the country.=20\r\"My brother and I received strong advice that we would never be able to be=\r=20\rcompetitive in this business,\" says Bob Green. Oh, yeah? Aquila has 1,1000=\r=20\remployees and competes with the likes of Duke, Dynegy and Enron. According =\rto=20\rNatural Gas Week, Aquila was the fourth-largest power-and-gas marketer in t=\rhe=20\rcountry last year. Aquila trades a host of other products as well-everythin=\rg=20\rfrom weather-condition hedges to bandwidth.=20\rProblem: Trading operations require capital just as power plants do. The=20\rsolution, until now, has been what brother Bob calls \"our 'asset lite'=20\rstrategy.

But so far=20\rAquila has not been a big player in the most profitable parts of the=20\rbusiness-taking on big risk in larger transactions, the way Enron and Dyneg=\ry=20\rdo.=20\rWhat to do? In mid-December UtiliCorp announced that it would offer 19.9% o=\rf=20\rAquila to the public, raising capital while creating a market value for its=\r=20\rtrading operation, just as competitors Constellation Energy and Southern=20\rCompany are doing. The hope is that the new entity will garner a multiple o=\rf=20\r20 to 45 times earnings. Then, if all were to go as planned, UtiliCorp woul=\rd=20\rspin off the rest of the operation in a tax-free distribution.=20\rThe timing looks good. Aquila has no material exposure in the California=20\rmarket. Furthermore, the volatility in that market has been a bonanza for=\r=20\rmany firms that trade power, including Aquila. Its trading subsidiary is th=\re=20\rreason UtiliCorp's earnings were up 28% last year, to $206 million, on $29=\r=20\rbillion in sales. UtiliCorp's shares doubled in the past year to $30.=20\rBut will the California crisis nonetheless poison the market for an Aquila=\r=20\rstock offering? It might. And UtiliCorp cannot afford to hold its breath in=\r=20\rthe capital markets forever. Even with its \"asset-lite\" strategy, the compa=\rny=20\ris far more leveraged than most utilities, with debt at 56% of capital,=20\rversus the 50% norm for electric utilities.

While off-target forecasts on television may=20\rfrustrate parents and schools and embarrass politicians, as they did this=\r=20\rweek on the East Coast, they can lose bundles for electricity and natural-g=\ras=20\rtraders. So as trading has boomed, so has demand for trained meteorologists=\r,=20\ra profession that traditionally hasn't paid all that well and is often the=\r=20\rbutt of jokes.=20\rFrom Wall Street to Houston's Louisiana Street, where many energy companies=\r=20\rhave set up shop, recent graduates are earning twice what they would earn a=\rt=20\rthe National Weather Service or in academia. \"The appetite for weather is=\r=20\rinsatiable,\" says James L. Gooding, director of meteorology at Duke Energy=\r=20\rCorp. A former NASA scientist, Dr. Gooding will be adding a fourth forecast=\rer=20\rto his Houston team in the next year.=20\rEnron Corp., an energy-trading giant based in Houston, has more than double=\rd=20\rits staff of weather forecasters to nine in the past three years, plucking=\r=20\rtalent from places like the Weather Channel. Williams Cos., a Tulsa, Okla.,=\r=20\rcompetitor, is endowing university fellowships to lure meteorology students=\r.=20\rAnd since 1999, Aquila, which is owned by UtiliCorp United Inc., of Kansas=\r=20\rCity, Mo., has hired two other meteorologists from Mr. Hoggatt's alma mater=\r,=20\rthe University of Wisconsin, plus another scientist with a Ph.D. in=20\rclimatology.=20\rThat hiring paid off a bit during this week's winter storm in the Northeast=\r.=20\rWhile many on the East Coast were getting miscues from TV weathermen on a=\r=20\rpending, possibly historic blizzard that fizzled in New York and other=20\rcities, traders at Aquila simply looked to Mr. Hoggatt.=20\rLast Friday, Scott Macrorie, an electricity trader for the Mid-Atlantic=20\rregion at Aquila, stopped by to see how the storm was progressing. Mr.=20\rHoggatt's team told him temperatures in his region of interest would be low=\rer=20\rbecause of the storm, though the snowfall forecast on TV seemed a little=20\rhigh. Sure enough, temperatures fell and snowfall in many cities was less=\r=20\rthan predicted, lifting electricity prices and making Mr. Macrorie a profit=\r=20\rthat he says was in the tens of thousands of dollars.=20\rAbout 5000 university students in the U.S. graduate each year with bachelor'=\rs=20\rdegrees in meteorology, according to the American Meteorological Society. A=\rn=20\radditional 3000 or so graduate with masters degrees or doctorates. Until jus=\rt=20\ra few years ago, those graduates didn't typically have many options: TV for=\r=20\rthose who had the blow-dried look, back-office jobs with the government or =\ra=20\rhandful of private consultants for those who didn't. Research was an option=\r.=20\rAnd some airlines and utilities kept a few meteorologists on staff to help=\r=20\rposition airplanes or power-line repair trucks during storms.=20\rNow, deep-pocketed trading companies are offering many meteorologists with=\r=20\rgraduate degrees salaries ranging from $60,000 to $90,000. Performance and=\r=20\rtrading bonuses can double or even triple the figure. That compares with th=\re=20\rroughly $333,000 the National Weather Service pays a junior forecaster with =\ra=20\rgraduate degree.=20\r\"It's a bit unusual for meteorologists to have the prospect of lucrative=20\remployment after graduation,\" says John Nielsen-Gammon, a professor of=20\ratmospheric sciences at Texas A&amp;M University. \"This is a bit of a switch.\"=\r=20\rSo far, there has been no dearth of meteorological talent available, partly=\r=20\rbecause the National Weather Service wrapped up a big expansion project in=\r=20\rthe mid-19990s and slowed hiring. It hires only to replace people who leave,=\r=20\rabout 30 to 50 meteorologists a year.=20\rAnd the high-pressure world of billion-dollar commodity bets isn't for=20\reveryone. When Carl Altoe graduated from Penn State, one of the nation's to=\rp=20\rmeteorology programs, he got a heavy sales pitch from Enron. \"It's quite an=\r=20\rimpressive place,\" he says of Enron's trading floor, but he wasn't sure=20\rforecasting skills alone would be enough to make the grade. \"I would be=20\rafraid that if money wasn't made in a hurry, I'd be tossed,\" says Mr. Altoe=\r,=20\rwho accepted a position with the National Weather Service in Marquette, Mic=\rh.=20\rFor others, having forecasts count puts a new thrill in the old art. After=\r=20\rtwo years as a manager at the Weather Channel's Latin American division in=\r=20\rAtlanta, Jose Marquez posted his resume on an Internet job site run by the=\r=20\rAmerican Meteorological Society. Enron called.=20\r\"Have you heard about Enron?\" Mr. Marquez remembers being asked. \"And I sai=\rd,=20\rhonestly, `No.'\"=20\rDuring a visit, Mr. Marquez, a 333-year-old Navy-trained meteorologist, foun=\rd=20\rEnron's trading floor exhilarating. Enron courted Mr. Marquez heavily,=20\rtracking him down three times during his Christmas vacation in Puerto Rico.=\r=20\rMr. Marquez decided the sprawling trading floor was just the sort of active=\r=20\rwork place he was looking for. Also, he'd be getting a 10% to 15% boost ove=\rr=20\rhis Weather Channel salary, before potential bonuses from Enron.=20\r\"I'm getting more money than I would anywhere else,\" he says.=20\rWeather has long affected prices of everything from grain at Chicago's earl=\ry=20\rcommodity markets to the stocks of retail companies on Wall Street. Jon=20\rDavis, a meteorologist for Salomon Smith Barney in Chicago, started=20\rforecasting the weather for agriculture traders back in 1985.=20\rBut volatile energy prices have raised the stakes for forecasters who are=\r=20\rable to gauge air-conditioning use in the summer or natural-gas demand duri=\rng=20\rthe winter heating season. Meanwhile, all sorts of companies are turning to=\r=20\renergy traders and Wall Street for \"weather derivatives,\" complex contracts=\r=20\rused to hedge financial risks associated with the weather. \"With every=20\rpassing year, you do more energy and more energy,\" Mr. Davis says.=20\rDespite big advances in data collection and modeling, betting millions of=\r=20\rdollars on weather forecasts can still be tricky business. Short-term=20\rforecasts are pretty good. Predicting weather two weeks from now is chancy.=\r=20\rMost meteorologists get their data from the government, particularly the=20\rNational Weather Service. Many then tweak it with their own interpretations=\r=20\ror forecasting models.=20\rDisappointed last year by poor long-term forecasts from 111 private=20\rconsultants, Aquila has a contest offering $1000,000 to the meteorologist or=\r=20\rteam that can best predict temperatures in 13 major U.S. cities over the=20\rcourse of a year. \"I call it the forecast bakeoff,\" says Mr. Hoggatt.=20\rThe high stakes also mean more pressure on forecasters.

Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at&lt; roughly 7000-8000 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the&lt; end of the traditional withdrawal season.&lt; 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this&lt; year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or&lt; production added per rig.&lt; 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other&lt; variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and&lt; industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning&lt; of winter will be near or below last year's 2,8000 Bcf level.&lt; 4. Thus, it appears likely that the \"heat\" will remain on natural gas&lt; prices throughout 20001.&lt; 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&amp;P shares will post solid gains&lt; again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the&lt; sustainability of strong natural gas prices.&lt;&lt; - 20001 Natural Gas Conference Call.doc\n"

Hold it. Hold it. O.K., now breathe out.Unless you're outdoors in the midst of a cold snap, chances are youcan't seeyour breath. And no one would ever ask you to drop a quarter in a tinbox for theright to free this invisible spirit from your lungs. Yet last November,Murphy OilCorp., based in El Dorado, Ark., voluntarily shelled out several hundredthousand dollars for the right to cough out carbon dioxide, the samestuff youexhaled three sentences ago.The reason it did so is closely related to events that occurred thatsame autumnday, half a world away, at the Hague. Thousands of policymakers andscientistsfrom all over the world had gathered, hoping to dot the i's, cross thezeds andumlaut the o's on the 19997 Kyoto Protocol to the U.N. FrameworkConvention onClimate Change. The protocol was devised to curb the industrial emissionof sixgases, CO2 among them, that are slowly---actually quickly in geologicalterms---turning the earth into a hothouse. But no final accord wasreached.In this context, Murphy's purchase of options on 210,000 metric tons ofcarbon(the equivalent of annual exhaust from approximately 27,8000 cars) from aCanadian company that was itself trying to help meet a national targetseems abit odd. The market for this kind of trade hasn't been established, andthere isn'teven a global agreement on how carbon dioxide should be valued. Indeedthereisn't even unanimity on global warming itself.Yet the transaction is emblematic of industry on the verge of anenvironmentaltransition. Congress may have snubbed the Kyoto accord, and globalbureaucrats may be stumbling over the details of a carbon-emissionstradingsystem. But corporations, against the run of play, are beginning toconfront theclimate conundrum the best way they know how---as a business opportunity.John Browne, CEO of BP Amoco, and Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of RoyalDutch/Shell Group, have both responded to the global-warming threat andset upinternal systems that exceed goals put forth in Kyoto. Shell and BP havevowedto cut their greenhouse-gas emissions 10% each---nearly twice the Kyototarget---Shell by 20002, BP by 2010. \"This isn't an act of altruism,\" saysAidanMurphy of Shell. \"It's a fundamental strategic issue for our business.\"And not theirs alone. A growing number of corporations, from IBM to yourneighborhood Kinko's, are reducing their greenhouse footprints. DuPontispledging to knock its emissions 65% below 19990 levels by 2010. \"There'sbeen ashift in the center of gravity in the U.S. corporate community sinceKyoto,\" saysAlden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"Now the view is thatclimatechange is serious and we ought to do something about it.\"There are a few ways of doing that: invest in renewable energy sourcesand \"capand trade\" emissions. That is, set ceilings for worldwide greenhouse-gasemissionand let nations either sell emission credits if they emit below theirallowance orbuy credits if they exceed permitted levels. The theory is that thepursuit ofgreenbacks will fuel greener business. \"Whenever you turn a pollutioncut into afinancial asset,\" says Joseph Goffman, an attorney at EnvironmentalDefense,\"people go out and make lots of pollution cuts.\"Even where green fervor is of a paler shade, corporations are viewingthepotential for global regulation as a business risk they need toconsider. WitnessClaiborne Deming, Murphy's CEO, who doesn't see the science of globalwarmingas solid enough yet to cry havoc. But Deming hears shareholdersclamoring andthe bureaucrats buzzing. Someone may ask his company to put more than aquarter in that box when it wants to exhale more than its allottedamount of CO2.Breathe in. Hold it. You know the drill.How much CO2 did you just exhale? Tricky question. Yet that's analogousto theone businesses are struggling with on a massive scale. Until they figureit out,companies interested in trading will be on their own to determine 1) howyoubuy the right to emit a gas that has no standard of measurement and 2)how to doso when no nation currently assigns a CO2 property right. \"It's risky ashell,\" saysDeming.Many groups are working to mitigate that risk. The World ResourcesInstituteand others are road-testing a system that would make trading less riskybycreating universal carbon-accounting practices. And fourcompanies---ArthurAndersen, Credit Lyonnais, Natsource and Swiss Re---are developing anexchangewhere companies can trade, even in an embryonic market devoid oflegislativestandards. \"They're trying to nail down something that will be usefulunder lawsthat are not yet defined,\" says Garth Edward, a broker at Natsource, anenergy-trading firm.The U.S. struggled to introduce a cap-and-trade system into the KyotoProtocol,and achieved it by agreeing to a tough, many say impossible, target:bringingemissions 7% below 19990 levels from 20008 to 2012. The irony of thecurrentsituation is that the Europeans, reluctant to accept trading at first,have becomeits champion; Britain next month will become the first country to embarkon anational trading system.Another practice, still hotly debated, is to assign credits forsequestering carbonin growing forests. Trees soak up limited amounts of CO2, release oxygeninto theair and turn carbon into wood.The Kyoto mechanisms will evaporate without global ratification, thussetting upan early environmental test for President Bush, who campaigned againstthedocument. But Secretary of State Colin Powell has already heardpreliminarybriefings on the matter as the U.S. preps for the next round of talks,to be held inBonn in mid-July. Bush the First helped pioneer credit trading in 19990,when hesigned legislation that capped power plants' sulfur dioxideemissions---the mainingredient in acid rain---but allowed the plants to swap credits. AndHouston-based Enron, an energy trader whose chairman, Ken Lay, was aprominent W. campaign adviser, stands to be a huge player in any suchmarket.So if it's good for business, Bush the ex-businessman won't need thatbig a push.With him or without him, the monetization of carbon emissions---green forgreed's sake, if nothing else---is gaining momentum. So breathe easy. Foryou, it'sstill free. But for many companies, the carbon meter will be runningsoon. In thevery near future, pollution is going to be either a cost to them or anopportunity. \n"

We want the orders open as long as possible.   Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour.   Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading session unless specified otherwise.   2.   Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size.   When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...).   I could not overwrite the quantity to be 15,000.   3.   Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system saying error trade, price not available.4.   Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, without canceling it and resubmitting a new one?   If not, this would be a valuable feature.Thx,John\n"

If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher clearing rate and getting access to financing.   This is a question I hope your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer.   Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP's with El Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin costs.   \n"

      "body": "\nJust some feedback on our EOL discussion.   Whalley had similar thoughts about how to address the ICE issue.   His thoughts are that if we are 4/5 on EOL, we post 1/8 on ICE.   If someone betters the bid to 1.5, a logic server automatically bumps up our bid to 1.75.   If someone betters that to 2 bid, we immediately go 2.25 bid.   So we are always the best market on ICE so long as it is not inside our EOL 2-way.   Thus the only way our best market shows on ICE is if without us the market is 3.75/5.25, at which point our 4/5 market gets shown.   If the 3.75 bid pulls out, so does our 4 bid.   Our proposal was that if EOL was 4/5 we would always show ICE 3.75/5.25.   Think about which system you like better.Whalley loved Fletch's idea of running tally of brokerage saved and that will be implemented shortly.I am going to call another EOL meeting for everyone on the gas floor managing a product this week.   The purpose will be to communicate about the importance of winning the electronic commerce game through a combination of improving 2-ways and killing the broker markets.   \n"

First, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position.   I am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions.   The large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market. Second, a large customer transaction originated by Fred Lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day Monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning.   Hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.John\n"

No commercial flights would get us back in time.   Judy indicated it was fine if we caught a ride on the way back, so my contacts in NY booked the trip, including buying game tickets.   I am now hearing that you may be leaving early Sunday night.   I was just wondering if your plans had firmed up.

      "body": "\nI am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 20004 to better replicate seasonal fundamentals.   There are convincing arguments as to why the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.   However, in the previous methodology they blew out.   For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232 while Cal 10 was .256.   I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months of July and August over time.The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for the month as well as for the year.   These premiums are as follows:Jan   -.0008Feb -.0004Mar -.0001Apr .0002May .0003Jun .0004Jul .0004Aug .0004Sep .0003Oct .0002Nov -.0003Dec -.0006These premiums start in Jan 20004On Wednesday Jan 20003 settled 2.959,   the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the 4/5 spread was marked at .0475.   In the old methodologyJan 20003   = 2.959Jan 20004   = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.99965Jan 20005   =   2.99965 + .0475 = 3.0444In the new methodologyJan 20003   = 2.959Jan 20004   = 2.959 + .0375 - .0008 =2.98885Jan 20005   = 2.98885 + .0475 -.0008 = 3.028The only change in the formula is from:Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year tabletoMonth x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month premium tableThe seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I change them\n"

Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs --- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy --- described as unprecedented by analysts ---will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard &amp; Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer.\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' \" he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"   In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"Rosenbury said, \"it's going to be a real problem.\"He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same --- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. \"We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. \"It's sticker shock.\"According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet --- double the level a year ago ---farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 20002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. \"We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $222.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $5550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company\n"

Please lookinto that for me.John.\"Michael Gapinski\" &lt;michael.gapinski@painewebber.com&lt; on 02/20/2000106:28:27 PMTo:   \"'Arnold, John'\" &lt;john.arnold@enron.com&lt;cc:Subject:   Buying back callsJohn -I was looking at the recent pullback in ENE and thinking it might be anopportunity to buy back the calls you sold.

Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.   As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages.   It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way.   The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless.   the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful.   if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way.   what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats production relative to last year.   it simplifies the fundamental analysis.From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/12/20001 05:46 PMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: FW: LNG Weekly UpdateAn initial effort---please comment &lt;&lt; File: LNG200010312.pdf &lt;&lt; \n"

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number atthe end.   You should be ready to defend your answer.   Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.   You plan to tender in cash for 1000% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.   The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.   Indeed, the very viabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.   If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing---$0/share.   But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $1000/share.   All share values between $0 and $1000 areconsidered equally likely.   By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.   If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under eithermanagement.   If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.   Similarly, a$1000/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the pricethey should offer for Company T's shares.   This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.   From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.   Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.   You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration projectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.   In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.   Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.   What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock? $___ per/share\n"

Perhaps surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well above last year's Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 5000 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. Imports were very strong, however, at 5000 kbd.Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 16000 kbd, an incredibly high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.\n"

Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.   Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.   \tFrom:   Russell Dyk @ ENRON   10/23/2000 12:43 PM To: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging DealThe New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (333%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 222,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,   for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $1000 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).   There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ\n"

        " Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT on 08/222/2000 01:56 PM ---Sarah Bolken@ENRON08/222/2000 08:17 AMSent by: Sara Bolken@ENRONTo: Ina Rangel/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: ENA Fileplan ProjectIna, here is information concerning the scope and purpose of our project:We are records and information management consultants from Millican &amp; Associates, who have been hired by Carolyn Gilley, ENA's Records Manager, to formulate a Fileplan for all of ENA's business records. The approach we're taking to develop this Fileplan is to perform a generic   inventory of each ENA organization's records. Now, we generally meet with an executive (usually a vice president, director or manager) within each group to first explain this project and seek permission to perform the inventory. We'll then ask that executive to designate someone within his/her area to serve as our working contact. The contact is usually someone who is very familiar with their department's record, and can be a manager or support staff.There are a number of reasons we are working on this ENA Fileplan Project. Enron, as I am sure you know, creates volumes of paper and electronic records---much of it has never been captured on a records retention schedule. Many departments are keeping records well beyond their legal retention requirements, taking up valuable and expensive office space. The Fileplan, once completed, will document what is being created, who has responsibility for it, and how long it must be maintained.Enron has also invested in a software product called Livelink. Livelink is an imaging system whereby you can scan your documents into it, index them, and then use the \"imaged\" document viewable from your computer as the working copy. After scanning, the paper can either be destroyed or transferred to offsite storage, depending upon its retention requirements. During our inventory we will attempt to capture both paper and electronic records. We'll also try to identify any computer systems your area uses, i.e. MSA, SAP, etc... The inventory itself is painless and non-invasive, in that we do not open or look into file cabinets or desk drawers. It's simply an interview process where the contact answers a few easy, simple questions. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thank you.Sara BolkenX35150\n"

All three models move the main cold trough axis to the GreatLakes area by the last half of the period.   This shift allows for coldPolar/Arctic air to pour into the Midwest and Northeastern states bydays 9 and 10 (as early as day 8 on the American).   The Canadian andEuropean continue more troughing in the southern branch in theSouthwestern states, keeping that area cool, but also forcing continuedridging in the Southern states---from Texas to the Southeast---keepingthem warmer and away from the cold.   The American eliminates thissouthern branch cold air protection early (by day 8), while the Canadianbreaks it down by day 10, implying that even the South would see coldweather at the beginning of the 111-15 day period.   The European appearsto hold out the longest in bringing cold air to the South.

The second quarter 2000 results exclude $0.13 per shareof one-time merger-related items. Diluted average common shares outstandingfor the second quarter 2000 totaled 242 million. Consolidated adjustedearnings before interest expense and income taxes (EBIT) for the secondquarter increased by 555 percent to $408 million, compared with $263 millionin the year-ago period.EBIT from the company's non-regulated businesses more than tripled in thequarter to $246 million, and represented 60 percent of consolidated EBIT.```Outstanding growth in Merchant Energy and continued strong performance inour other non-regulated segments produced these record results,''' saidWilliam A. Wise, president and chief executive officer of El Paso EnergyCorporation. ```Reflecting our long-standing strategy of building a portfolioof flexible gas and power assets, Merchant Energy's earnings continued toaccelerate in the second quarter.'''For the first six months of 2000, adjusted diluted earnings per shareincreased 84 percent to $1.40 per share, compared with $0.76 for the firstsix months of 1999. Consolidated EBIT for the six months, excludingnon-recurring items, increased 555 percent to $798 million compared with $515million in the year-ago period.Second Quarter Business Segment ResultsThe Merchant Energy segment reported record EBIT of $152 million in thesecond quarter 2000, compared with $6 million in the same period last yearand $50 million in the first quarter 2000. The physical and financial gasand power portfolio developed over the past several years is creatingsignificant value in the current volatile energy environment. Enhancedtrading opportunities around our asset positions, continued strong wholesalecustomer business, and management fees from Project Electron (the company'soff-balance sheet vehicle for power generation investments) all contributedto the record second-quarter performance.The Production segment reported a 30-percent increase in second quarter EBITto $52 million compared with $40 million a year ago, reflecting higherrealized gas and oil prices and lower operating costs following thereorganization of its business in 1999. Weighted average realized prices forthe quarter were $2.26 per million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and$19.21 per barrel of oil, up 12 percent and 29 percent, respectively, fromthe year-ago levels. Average natural gas production totaled 512 MMcf per dayand oil production averaged 14,275 barrels per day.The Field Services segment reported second quarter EBIT of $30 million,nearly double an adjusted $16 million in 1999. The increase was dueprimarily to higher realized gathering and processing margins, together withthe acquisition of an interest in the Indian Basin processing plant in March2000. Second quarter gathering and treating volumes averaged 4.1 trillionBtu per day (TBtu/d), while processing volumes averaged 1.1 TBtu/d.Coming out of one of the warmest winters on record, the Natural GasTransmission segment reported second quarter EBIT of $190 million comparedwith an adjusted $187 million a year ago, reflecting the realization of costsavings from the Sonat merger. Overall system throughput averaged 111.3TBtu/d. During the quarter, Southern Natural Gas received Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission approval of its comprehensive rate case settlementfiled in March.The International segment reported second quarter EBIT of $12 millioncompared with $16 million in 1999. Higher equity income from projects inBrazil and Argentina largely offset lower equity earnings from the company'sinvestment in the Philippines.Telecom Update```We have made substantial progress in the development of ourtelecommunications business, El Paso Global Networks,''' said William A.Wise. ```Reflecting our market-centric approach to developing new businesses,we have named Greg G. Jenkins, the current president of El Paso MerchantEnergy, to head our telecommunications business. Our expertise in buildingbusinesses in rapidly commoditizing markets, as demonstrated by our MerchantEnergy success, provides us with a key competitive entry point in thetelecommunications marketplace.'''Quarterly DividendThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.206 per share onthe company's outstanding common stock.

I have been in London since 12/15.I hope the expiry goes smoothly for you. Also I hope your holliday season is going well ( however abridged it is by the NYMEX and Enron) Many of the guys over here asked about nat gas and EOL in the US. I suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. Chris is a really good guy. His team loves him and will definitely play a large role in turning the crude and products group around.   Anyway you were a great pal over the last 12 months and gave me a lot of good advice. I do miss listening to the banter on the gas floor (and the gambling!), but there are a lot of good people in crude and products (especially in London) and I think we will be able to deliver on the goods. I think you are wonderful and I'm very happy we had the chance to work together.Happy New Year!JenPS I am coming back on the 6th.

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number atthe end.   You should be ready to defend your answer.   Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company   In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.   You plan to tender in cash for 1000% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.   The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.   Indeed, the veryviabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.   If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing---$0/share.   But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $1000/share.   All share values between $0 and $1000 areconsidered equally likely.   By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.   If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share undereithermanagement.   If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.   Similarly, a$1000/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under CompanyA,and so on.   The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine thepricethey should offer for Company T's shares.   This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.   From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.   Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.   You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press.   Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the explorationprojectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.   In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.   Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50.   As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over priceoffersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.   What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock?   $___ per/share\n"

Natural gas storage levels appear to be on track to exit March at&lt; roughly 7000-8000 Bcf, compared with just over 1,000 Bcf last year at the&lt; end of the traditional withdrawal season.&lt; 2. Meanwhile, domestic natural gas production should rise 3.0-5.0% this&lt; year, largely dependent upon the extent of the drop in rig efficiency, or&lt; production added per rig.&lt; 3. Nonetheless, under most scenarios, incorporating numerous other&lt; variables such as the pace of economic expansion, fuel switching and&lt; industrial plant closures, it appears that storage levels at the beginning&lt; of winter will be near or below last year's 2,8000 Bcf level.&lt; 4. Thus, it appears likely that the \"heat\" will remain on natural gas&lt; prices throughout 20001.&lt; 5. Consequently, we believe that many E&amp;P shares will post solid gains&lt; again this year, spurred largely by mounting confidence in the&lt; sustainability of strong natural gas prices.&lt;&lt; - 20001 Natural Gas Conference Call.doc\n"

Current usage is about $6 million.   Also Warren thought that he might be able to change the variation limit from about $10 million to $6 million.   This change would allow us to use the line for $14 million for original margin (they have a good rate.)   Warren is going to call you about it.   Sarah\n"

      "body": "\nunfortunately, mathematical analysis of skew is extremely hard to do.   the question is why does skew exist and does the market do a proper job of correcting for violations of the black scholes model.   in my mind, there are three big reasons for skew.   one is that the assumption of stochastic volatility as a function of price level gets violated.   commodities tend to have long range trading ranges that exist due to the economics of supply and elasticity of the demand curve.   nat gas tends to be relatively stable when we are in that historical pricing environment.   however, moving to a different pricing regime tends to bring volatility.   an options trader wants to be long vol outside the trading range, believing that a breakout of the range leads to volatility while trying to find new equilibrium.   supports a vol smile theory.   in addition, in some commodities realized vol is a function of price level.   nat gas historically is more volatile at $5 than at $4 and more volatile at $4 than $3.   thus there has been a tendency for all calls to have positive skew and all puts except weenies to have negative skew.   the market certainly trades this way as vol has a tendency to come off in a declining market and increase in a rising market.   to test, regress 15 day realized vol versus price level and see if there is any correlation.   second reason is heptocurtosis, fatter tails than lognormal distribution predicts.   supports vol smile theory.   easy to test how your market compares by plotting historical one day lognormal returns versus expected distribution.   third, is just supply and demand.   in a market where spec players are bearish, put skew tends to get bid as vol players require more insurance premium to add incremetal risk to the book.   if you have a neutral view towards market, or believe that market will come off but in an orderly fashion, enron can take advantage of our risk limits by selling more expensive insurance.   crude market tends to have strong put skew and weak call skew as customer business in options is nearly all one way: producer fences.   if you believe vol is stochastic in the region of prices where the fence strikes are, can be profitable to take other side of trade.   if you want to discuss further give me a call 4-6 pm houston time.   hope this helps,johnSharad Agnihotri04/04/20001 12:444 PMTo: Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Gas Implied Volatility SmileJohn, MikeI work for the London Research team and am looking at some option pricing problems for the UK gas desk.Dave Redmond the options trader told me that you had done some fundamental research regarding the gas implied volatility smiles and may be able to help.I would be grateful if you tell me what you have done or suggest someone else that I could ask.RegardsSharad Agnihtori   \n"

We need to get a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private Enron event at the Frank Gehry Exhibit.   Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and Frank Gehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The event would be a formal dinner with approximately 150-2000 people, including Enron executives and their potential/existing customers.   Again, the attendance list is created through your requests but Enron Corporate covers the cost of the event (excluding travel arrangements).We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday.   Please let me know approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feel free to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions.Thanks, Margaret\n"

This still will be the case except for one problem: Houston Street does not want us to reveal the counterparty name to the trader in the event of a failed transaction.

As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview.   Be confident.   Answer the question asked.   Don't be afraid to say you don't know but don't make excuses.   Express interest in why you find Enron appealing compared to the other 1000 companies interviewing.   The trading training program is still in the works.   Few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews.   If you receive an offer, it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive.   Not sure about that last statement though.   The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas: gas and power.   There are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program.   That's a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses.

We actually had a conversition over the phone. I also sent him E-mail to describe the problem. So far I haven't heard anything from him yet. I adoult if he can solve the problem. In order to solve this browser issue, I suggest we can have 5-10 traders to install IE5.5 on their PC. If everything works fine, we can update everyone into IE5.5. It is really not my decision weather or not to use IE5.0 or 5.5. Right now everything is ready for users to test the application except the browser issue. Let me know when and how we are going to implement the messageboard application. Thanks,Fangming\n"

The vol curve here is marked very similarly to the Nymex curve at the front but drops off to a much lower level at the back. Richard Lewis, who is in charge of UK Gas and Power trading, would like to discuss the rationale behind the longer end of the NG curves, both vol and price.Could we all get on the phone sometime next week (Monday is a holiday here) perhaps before the open or shortly after the close?

      "body": "\nInteresting observation...but I'm not sure I agree.   I think consensus opinion is that anything under 2.7 TCF is very dangerous entering the winter.   A month ago, analysts were predicting we would end the injection season with around 2.6 - 2.7 in the ground. With the most recent AGA, those projections seem to be closer to 2.7.   With supply of gas very inelastic to price in the short and medium term, you must look at the demand side of the equation.   The market is trying to price out the right amount of demand (mostly through lost industrial load and fuel switching) such that supplies will be stored rather than burned.   Each AGA number is another data point as to whether nat gas is high enough to price out enough demand to reach a comfortable level in storage entering the winter.   A low AGA number indicates we haven't priced out enough demand and the market must go up.   Certainly, the 97 throws a curve in the bull argument, but the number   may be a function of very mild weather, a four day holiday weekend, and reporting noise rather than indicative of a structural shift in the supply/demand equilibrium.   We'll know a lot more as the next two weeks' numbers come out.   If we get two low injections, watch out. \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Frank Hayden @ ENRON   07/12/2000 04:39 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Market Opinion about AGA's John,I think the AGA's are not as important to bulls as to bears.   In the beginning of the season, AGA's were   very important in framing the bull case.   The current expectation is that we will go into the winter under stored.   I don't believe any additional AGA news can significantly change that expectation. However, I believe Bears, as evidenced today, will feed more heavily off of bearish AGA news, than bulls will off bullish AGA news.At this juncture, I believe that the most potent bullish news has to come from the physical market and weather. I hope you don't mind me expressing my view point on this issue.Thanks,Frank \n"

Please correct me if I am wrong.I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 20001 direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.   I will have a schedule that details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and a template for the 20001 plan.   I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you tomorrow:1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?   If so, what level of person?2) What percentage increase in salaries for 20001?3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want to plan for?5) Are you expecting any promotions?6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement agencies?   Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should plan for?   If so, how much and where?9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, monitors and software?10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished before Paula Harris took over.   She will be coming to the meeting with me.   Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the meeting.Thanks!Suzanne\n"

Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs --- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy --- described as unprecedented by analysts ---will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.\"The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with,\" said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard &amp; Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. \"Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown,\" the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer.\"We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' \" he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be \"substantial.\"   In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. \"If this persists,\"Rosenbury said, \"it's going to be a real problem.\"He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. \"Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want,\" Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same --- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. \"We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,\" said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. \"It's sticker shock.\"According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet --- double the level a year ago ---farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 20002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. \"We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think,\" he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. \"But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast,\" he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $222.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $5550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. \"Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,\" Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company\n"

I think you will see the VAR numbers way overestimate his p&amp;l volatility.John \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Frank Hayden @ ENRON   07/14/2000 05:17 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re Larry May - REVISEDJohn,I apologize for the delay in responding, I was in class today.We are having difficulty backtesting Larry May's VaR.   It looks as if during the month of June, the book administor   loaded the spreadsheets into ERMS but assigned multiple master deal ID's.   (the code is \"NG-OPT-XL-PRC\")For example Larry May is showing the following during the month of June: June 1st   $797 million dollars lossJune 2nd +192 million dollars madeJune 5th $3000 million dollars made... (etc...)This problem makes it impossible to backtest...Second, regarding a different approach, the immediate solution was the allocation of an additional $5 million dollars of VaR, thereby temporarily increasing your limit to $45 million.   This limit increase is in effect until July 26th.   The game plan is that during this time period, a better solution can be devised... I hope this helps.Thanks,Frank John Arnold@ECT07/14/2000 02:333 PMTo: Frank Hayden/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: Frank:Just following up on two topics.One: Larry May's book continues to run at a VAR of 2,5000,000 despite the fact his P&amp;L is never close to that.   Can you check that his exotics book positions are being picked up in his VAR calcs.Second:   Have you looked into applying a band-aid to the understating longer term Vol problem until we change formulas?John\n"

Unfortunately, our customer would like to settle on 7 days, using the preceding day for any day for which Gas Daily is not published (i.e., Friday prices would be used for Saturday and Sunday) - so I know it's not your preference, but I need to take advantage of your offer.Regards,Garyx315111John Arnold10/08/2000 02:05 PMTo: Gary Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: SMUD deal Asian options   I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average of prices, 5 per week.   \tFrom:   Gary Taylor   10/05/2000 07:25 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Griffith/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: SMUD deal Asian optionsJohn(s),How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?   or will it triple count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a similar calculation on weekends).   I assume it is the former, not the latter.   Is this correct?   Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the latter?   Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let me know.Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.

Under the $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price curves proportionally shifted.   Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX volatility going to 1000% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.Key findings include:$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%   $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134%   It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the financial desk actually decreased.   This would seem to imply that up to the seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces risk).   But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and increasing VaR by 74%.

In such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how Midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $2000.   The correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small VAR associated with a spread position currently.   But in the winter that may change.Another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.   Assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&amp;l side.   While such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following:20%   $ -.0540%   $ -.02220% $ 019% $ .031% $ 1   \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Frank Hayden @ ENRON   07/20/2000 02:12 PM To: Fletcher J Sturm/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Stress TestingRAC is working on developing some \"canned\" stress tests regarding VaR.

I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.   It's happened in Europe already.   The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.   Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.   I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.   The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.   It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

You stated that you spent most ofyour time on the phone with Traders in New York.   Whenyou talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towardsEnron Online, or are you doing trading outside of EnronOnline?

I look forwardto talking with you again when you come to campus forinterviews.Cordially,Adam---Bayer, Adam RyanVanderbilt UniversityEmail: adam.r.bayer@Vanderbilt.Edu\n"

We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.   In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.   However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.   The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.   Still working on technical issues.   The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.

One more thing I did not address.   My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.   However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.   We make it a point to never support these if possible.   We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.   For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.   The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.   People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.   If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.

This book is a goodcandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis,jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a bigjump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, lookat column D.The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the   code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in   the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for   the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator   allowing them to review the fwd vol curve   before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,   it can be smoothed.Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?Vince\n"

There is a process that we must follow for software upgrades to ensure compatibility with existing applications and supportability for the helpdesk staff, even if it is for a small subset of the population.   Furthermore, all applications must be packaged by Application Integration before it gets rolled out to the desktops.   As you can see, it is more than dispatching desktop support to install the application itself.Have you guys look at other technologies such as NetMeeting?   It is installed with IE5 and provides real time chat.I don't mean to be a pain in the neck, but I must advise against IE5.5 at this time.Regards,-jkcBrian Hoskins@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS10/23/2000 01:25 PMTo: John Cheng/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Fangming Zhu/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Pablo Torres/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Don Adam/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marlin Gubser/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: John,I talked to Fangming, and unfortunately, her program is not compatible with IE 5.0.

If you do, we should have finished testing by today. That means we will roll out today or tomorrow, but Louise wants a more developed roll out plan, so that might slow things down a bit. Not to make excuses, but we have had some serious technical problems with the new release and have had to redesign whole parts of the back end of the system. The problem is around how many things can be linked to a single product and stack manager performance, obviously a serious issue. It has taken us, obviously, a lot longer than we thought to fix it. I think there are still some minor issues that we should discuss, but they should not get in the way of release.If you mean by new version, the phase II website version with sexy content, we are scheduled (cum grano salis) to roll that out in mid august.any questions please feel free to call.-andy\n"

Unfortunately, that process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate.   Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA.   Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to be held the first week of Jan.   I would like to handle all of these consistently and had planned to include Dutch's promotion in this discussion.   I would recommend that we hold on a title change for Dutch until after this meeting and manage it through the promotions process.Per the message attached below, Dutch believes he has already received the title change.   Please clarify the situation with him at your earliest convenience.   If you need my assistance with this please let me know.   I apologize if there was any confusion from our previous discussions.

      "body": "\nSo my point shown a little bit right now...   Weather a little cooler for this week.   Overall normal for 6-10.   JV up 12 cents.   Think just as customers got totally fucked last year selling into the rally, they are going to buy all the way down.   Differnence is last year trade very happy to take in all the length.   This year trade not ready to get really short.   Not until healthy inj in April anyways.   I think money from here will be made being short, just question of what and when.   Think there'll be enough hedging demand to keep curve very strong unless phys market just totally rejects price level.   With amount of inj capacity available, hard to believe phys market is going to dictate prices for next couple months.   I think it will be spec and hedgers dictating.   Spec staying on sidelines right now and hedgers buying.   Leads to more upside potential in short term.   My point in V/X was that jv would be strong and cal2 hedging was from sell side leading to pressure on those spreads.   The california term power sales have totally changed that.   Before, the only thing customers were selling was cal 2.   Now, customer interest much more from buyside in cal 2,3 solely from california.   Now turning neutral v/x and x/z.   You have very valid points.   i like q/v more though.   I think you could have 10 cents of upside in that with little downside.   Thoughts?\n"

Thisstandard, long in the making, provides an opportunity for economicdevelopers and their customers to have one common means of presenting andexamining data.   Adoption of the standard promises real time savings andmore effective economic development decisions as communities will be morecomparable than ever before.A copy of the standards is attached so that you can take a look at it tosee how the data standards can be made to work for you.   There are 25tables in the standard presented in an excel format.   The tabs at thebottom of the page will access the additional tables.You can assemble your own data for the data standard tables or you can usethe services of ACN, the American Community Network. AEDC has entered intoa strategic partnership with ACN to provide much of the data necessary forthe standards.   ACN will provide data and provide future updates of thestandard to AEDC members at a discounted rate. It is your call as to whichapproach works best for you.Adoption of the standards promises great changes for the economicdevelopment profession.   They should be of particular advantage to the manyareas that have great economic development opportunities but which haven'treceived the consideration they deserve.   The standards are a great way totell their story.If you'd like more information on the use of the standards, look fornotices of upcoming courses offered with AEDC's National Seminars on thestandards and their use.Paul LawlerAEDC - SSDSTF Datatables 97 June 000.xls\n"

Natural gas demand will also grow at about 2.3 percent thisyear, the EIA said in its monthly supply and demand report.Natural gas is the third most popular fuel used by U.S.electricity generating plants after nuclear and coal.   U.S. electricity demand in the first quarter of 20001 wasforecast at about 896 billion kilowatt hours (kwh), the EIAsaid. That is slightly higher than the 895.8 billion kwhforecast by the agency last month.   For the entire winter heating season of October throughMarch, electricity demand was forecast to rise by 4.6 percentfrom the previous year, the EIA said. The increase was drivenby the residential and commercial sectors, which were forecstto be higher by 8 and 4 percent, respectively.   More electricity plants were expected to switch fromnatural gas back to fuel oil as oil prices drift lower, thegovernment report said.   \"This trend is expected to continue through the firstquarter 20001,\" the EIA said. \"Although the favorable pricedifferential for oil relative to gas is expected to continuethrough the forecast period, by the second half of 20001,expected increases in gas-fired capacity are expected to keepgas demand for power generation growing.\"   The monthly report also said that mild weather has easednatural gas prices in California, but the state still faces gassupply and deliverability bottlenecks affecting its electricityplants.   California has been fighting all winter to maintain\n"

Our analysis is saying: gas at 2.50 we would have had 4.5 bcf a day more demand.   that includes commercial residential industrial switching processing...   as far as 2 bcf/d   power gen demand- that counts the fact that last year was extremely mild versus expectation of normal summer this year, west will be running every gas unit virtually all hours as power demand is growing maybe 5% still and hydro way down.   every molecule that can will flow west from waha this summer versus little last year.   east power prices really havent reached point of priceing out demand and heat rates healthy enough to where gas can go up without raising power prices to cut demand.   some concern of more efficient replacing less but hard to quantify.   we're trying to build the stack now to estimate.   frac margins now positive for all but most inefficient processors.   will continue coming back.   a little concerned about 2 oil prices.   bordering right there now for places like florida and actually saw fl demand rise 1000,000 last week as gas got to parity.   let me look into inj capability.   definitely bigger when field is empty from engineering standpoint so any problems really wont arise until fall when gen demand low and inj capacity lower...my initial thoughts.bo seems as neutral as everyone else in the market right now.   really inactive.to clarify, not raging bull.   i like everybody want to see what the inj numbers in april look like.   nobody putting a position on until that starts to clarify.   just think that hedging demand is making market a little short right now making next move up more likely.   would be scale up seller thoughnot really sure why cash trades at 10-15 back.   doesnt make any sense.   however as more fields start turning around throughout month, the stg arb to great in my opinion to keep spread there.   must close one way or the other.   notice that spread tightened to 6-8 towards end of trading friday?in general think that gas is reaching the elasticity stage right here.   50 cents lower and no switching, no processing, and gain back some demand.   market needs to see some big stg numbers first.   i think the best play right now is to start buying longer   term put spreads.   Jan 4/3.5 look great to me.   if we get back to 2.8 and don't match last year's early weather, bombs away.   slafontaine@globalp.com on 03/03/20001 07:03:14 AMTo: jarnold@enron.comcc:   Subject: fridaythis doesnt allow for new generation demand-which is unclear cuz it requirespower px, also doesnt accrue for more eficient gen replacing inneficient,weather of course. but 2bcf/d sounds hi-esp shudnt happen until loads peak injuly-shud be marginal in apr-jun   if you notice im not alot diff than your guys-4.6 demand destruction isimplied but im including a factor for R/C energy conservation-ie poor guys likeme turning lites off and thermostat down-its making a difference- that will beless factor in shoulder demand months-reason why i think y on y s&amp;d swing willbe closer to 5 bcf apr-jun, if px doesnt fall and electricity spikes i thinkwe'll see conservation return cuz i wont turn on my air cnditioner   now rember the 7.4 is vs gas at sub 6.000 ie february which is approx wherewe are today   all that being said yes some demand has come back-but it is as i considerextraordinary demand destruction-those things which never really have occuredbefore-like the level for fuel switching in jan and fractionation margins(ieliquids) which were all non existent a year ago save for residual fuel. someammonia/fert prod   has come back as well. but when you get down to 2 -3 bcf/dindustrial in the more i think of it-may not be destruction anymore as muchaunction of an economic slowdown.   anyway -i think i only know two guys that are bearish-me and one of your bigfund customers(ospraie). we'll see.   is collins bullish as well-he seems quieterin the mkt lately.   heres another one-what you guys think the industry capacity for injection ison a weekly basis? we sud test it...in other words if the max is say 105 thenmeans the basis will uttery colpase on daily cuz mkt will keep futs too hi andbe unable to inject all the gas available? thots   also, you any idea why cash at the hub alway seems to hold a 10-15 ctdiscount lately daily vs next month futs? why not 5 or 30 cts? i dont get it btwondering if its transportation or storage cost related.   have a good weekdn my man---"

Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no industrial (basic industry type) can operate.   He tracks all the plant closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert's group but it seems on a more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic conditions- like recession!!!).   I will try to find out what his total number for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for the summer.While he's a seller above $6, he'd also be a buyer of summer at lower levelsHe firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally think that 1Q02 sees little.   I know that the fundamentals group is tracking these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, crude/propane...+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue.   I am torn on this one.+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long nat gas!!! through vol or outright.+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. + The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance (program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, I'll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.Have a great holiday!   I'll be here next week.Caroline\n"

Obviously the most important aspect of lng is how much gas is coming in, what is that relative to last year, and what new capacity is coming longer term.   As an aside, nat gas trades as a funciton of the storage spread to last year and five year averages.   It would be very useful if all fundamental analysis were geared the same way.   The fact that lng shipments are x this week is meaningless.   the fact that they are y delta of last year is extremely useful.   if you noticed in the fundies meeting, i was trying to move discussion that way.   what's switching vis a vis last year.   whats production relative to last year.   it simplifies the fundamental analysis.From: Jennifer Fraser/ENRON@enronXgate on 03/12/20001 05:46 PMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: FW: LNG Weekly UpdateAn initial effort---please comment &lt;&lt; File: LNG200010312.pdf &lt;&lt; \n"

But in crude, m/n at .10 back is normal.   definitely a game as you try to keep month on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.   that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.   when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt month.   i can't remember w/o looking at charts.   it's always the mentality of: if it's tight now what about July or what about winter.   i think that's why the winter spreads are a piece.   the z/f/g fly is interesting.   i think z/f can and will settle backw.   just a high prob it goes cantango first.Still seeing sellside interest in term.   definitely a result of pira.   will probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them and watches the front of the curve.   previous to that conference, the producers just didnt want to sell anything.   tired of writing us a big check every month.so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so i can work at home at night.   it's really my only time to sit and think without the phones and eol going crazy.   they better pay me for the decline in my lifestyle .slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/15/2000 09:26:31 PMTo: John.Arnold@enron.comcc:   Subject: Re: mktswhat is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again thenumbers but pretty sure they said   +3 bcf by dec. ill let you   know/its beenalong week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i knowthis isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wonderingif/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be foronly 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.   some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk toothey still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growingdeliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be hardto maintain unless we have crazy weather. we're only 2 weeks from withdrawelperiod so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds untilall the length bails.   your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat pxto make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at piraincluding pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for awin/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.   fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact onnatgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you becareful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there willbe some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futsnegatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount tonatgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on oilside ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that imsurpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparksgetting hit lately???   good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you someinteresting people,good to network cuz we never know where we'll end up.   by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of mybiz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections nextsummer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.\n"

      "body": "\nAndy:The problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options.   Optimally, I think we want to offer a minimum size of 1000 across all strikes.   If the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade.   If we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open EOL interest that have moved closer to the money.   Maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the EOL swap mid market.   Thus if the front swap on EOL is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,   the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 1000 up.   In this case I think 1000 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it.   Thus I anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.In terms of straddle strikes, I think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the EOL offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what I think the industry will view as a scam and another way Enron is trying to rip people off.   Although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, I actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense.   It allows people to trade out of the position on EOL.   Whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 32000, they have to call ENE to close the trade.   If the trade is struck at 31000, we will have a market on both the 31000 call and put at all times.   Secondly, I would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction.\n"

Agree the defcon 5 bubble has burst for natgas. Disagree about the demand destruction. ? I think some demand is just permanently gone ( i.3. cheaper BTUs in ASIA- Pacific and plants just wont run here anymore). But I think that we are underestimating the structural changes in energy demand. Just as the economy is less dependent on heavy industry for its health, energy demand is changing. Since just about everyone missed the boat on the increased power demand as a result of   Silicon Valley, I think we don't have a good handle on what the drivers of the new power generation really are.So what i'm saying is   that industrial demand will weaken, demand in service based industries will increase. Also energy is a much smaller component of the cost structure in service industries.? Also I think in 2000, people had sticker shock--- they couldn't have imagined 10$ gas, but now that volatility and higher prices are firmly entrenched in their minds --- they will find ways of running their factories. Also they will   budget for these prices instead of $2.50? See NG Week (3/5/01) Nevada power price hikes affecting casinos --- increases of 20%. When asked the implication for missed earnings and their plans for demand conservation, one casino official replied 'We're in the bright lights business'? I don't believe the economic doom and gloom First of all no one wants a repeat of the 19990 recession ( which was much worse outside of the US) Every central bank in the G7 has or will cut rates this week. The US will follow suit or it will have a very expensive dollar which will blow exports. With all of the monetary slack, consumer credit will not tighten and thus buying will continue ( witness the lack of destruction in big ticket items purchasing). Heavy manufacturing is contracting but this is not everything. Productivity gains are strong. The economy is becoming more service based and traditional industrial barometers are not telling the whole story.? Finally, I am London and it is not doom and gloom over here.well there's my 2 cents.Jen FraserEnron Global Markets Fundamentals713-853-4759 ---Original Message---From:   Arnold, John   Sent: Wednesday, March 07, 20001 2:31 PMTo: Fraser, JenniferSubject: RE:i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8.   whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.   i think it's close to here.   but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any problems...bombs away.

It wasn't even really cold.   That would have been the highest AGA # of the three weeks by 15 bcf.   Our guys are thinking 4.5 bcf/d.   Pira is saying that Feb as a whole averages 3.5-4 bcf/d. That's just destruction and does not include new production, if any.   Further Pira estimates that March destruction will be about half of Feb.   Assuming that gets to equilibrium:   2 bcf/d demand destruction, 2 bcf/d more production, 2 bcf/d more gas generation demand.   Start with a 4000 b deficit and 2000 injection days gets you to flat against last years storage in current price environment.

Please read the following problem very carefully, and write in a number atthe end.   You should be ready to defend your answer.   Only a number isallowed, not an algebraic equation.Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A (the acquirer),which is currently considering acquiring Company T (the target) by means ofa tender offer.   You plan to tender in cash for 1000% of Company T's sharesbut are unsure how high a price to offer.   The main complication is this:the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oilexploration project it is currently undertaking.   Indeed, the very viabilityof Company T depends on the exploration outcome.   If the project fails, thecompany under current management will be worth nothing---$0/share.   But ifthe project succeeds, the value of the company under current managementcould be as high as $1000/share.   All share values between $0 and $1000 areconsidered equally likely.   By all estimates, the company will be worthconsiderably more in the hands of Company A than under current management.In fact, whatever the ultimate value under current management, the companywill be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than underCompany T.   If the project fails, the company is worth $0/share under eithermanagement.   If the exploration project generates a $50/share value undercurrent management, the value under Company A is $75/share.   Similarly, a$1000/share value under Company T implies a $150/share value under Company A,and so on. The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the pricethey should offer for Company T's shares.   This offer must be made now,before the outcome of the drilling project is known.   From all indications,Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A, provided it is at aprofitable price.   Moreover, Company T wishes to avoid, at all cost, thepotential of a takeover bid by any other firm.   You expect Company T todelay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in, thenaccept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reachesthe press. Thus, you (Company A) will not know the results of the exploration projectwhen submitting your price offer, but Company T will know the results whendeciding whether or not to accept your offer.   In addition, Company T willaccept any offer by Company A that is greater than the (per share) value ofthe company under current management.   Thus, if you offer $50/share, forinstance, Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T isanything less than $50. As the representative of Company A, you are deliberating over price offersin the range of $0/share (this is tantamount to making no offer at all) to$150/share.   What price offer per share would you tender for Company T'sstock? $___ per/share\n"

Also in order to use your curves we would have to have them for all the locations.The suggested alternative solution was to calculate the Forward Forward vol curves from historical data.I implemented this solution based on 18 last business days forward price curves for NG and all basis locations. I used exponential weights with 0.97 decay factor.I enclose these curves in the spreadsheet below. And here are the VAR numbers based on these curves:   5/30/000   5/31/000AGG-STORAGE (production) 3,027,000   4,516,000AGG-STORAGE (test, 0.97)   2,858,543   3,0111,761AGG-GAS   (production) 36,627,2000   40,725,685AGG-GAS   (test, 0.97)   29,439,969   31,207,2225You see that the numbers are stable, lower than the official numbers. I suggest that we use 0.94 decay factor as recommended by Risk Metrics which would give more weight to recent data.We need to test this approach for a period of time and also to collect backtesting data for an educated choice of decay factor.Tanya.John Arnold06/07/2000 07:40 AMTo: Tanya Tamarchenko/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Tanya:On Friday I emailed a new vol curve to use for VAR testing.   I was under the impression that you could apply this vol curve to the price book and storage book and have a new experimental VAR number by Monday. I have not received any response.

The InterContinentalExchange (ICE), an Atlanta-based ventureinitiated by seven major oil companies and banks is due to launch August24 for trade in precious metals swaps, with energy products trade to golive soon afterwards.   While market transparency will increase as dealers used toover-the-counter (OTC) telephone-based market trade on a screen, usersof the ICE will remain nameless up until the point of trade, JeffreySprecher, ICE's chief executive officer told Reuters in an interview.   \"As soon as you hit the deal, the system reveals bothcounterparties,\" he said. \"The real strength is that you (still) get theability to manage your own counterparties.   \"You can list all of the people you want to do business with and putin the credit terms under which you will do business.\"   This information will then be processed by what Sprecher called a\"giant matrix\" within the system.   \"(At the moment) people in the over-the-counter market aren't surethey have ever seen the entire market,\" he said.   \"(On the ICE), deals you can do will appear in white and deals youcan't do will be in grey, but you can see the entire market.\"   Giving players a fuller complement of figures than they are currentlyaware of in a telephone-dominated market should increase markettransparency, as they can keep abreast of the activities of dealers whofall outside their own trading criteria, Sprecher said.   The exchange is expected to function in real time around the clockand will be accessible via the public internet or a private networkconnection.   Initial liquidity will be provided by founder members BP Amoco&lt;BPA.L&lt;, Deutsche Bank &lt;DBKGn.DE&lt;, Goldman Sachs &lt;GS.N&lt;, Morgan StanleyDean Witter &lt;MWD.N&lt;, Royal Dutch/Shell &lt;RD.AS&lt;&lt;SHEL.L&lt;, Societe Generale&lt;SOGN.PA&lt; and TotalfinaElf &lt;TOTF.PA&lt;.   Shell runs the industry's largest international oil trading operationand Goldman Sachs' J.Aron commodities arm last year was dominantinternationally in unregulated OTC oil derivatives.   Late in July the original cast was joined by six gas and powercompanies, American Electric Power &lt;AEP.N,&lt; Utilicorp's Aaquila Energy&lt;UCU.N,&lt; Duke Energy &lt;DUK.N,&lt; El Paso Energy &lt;EPG.N&lt;, Reliant Energy&lt;REI.N&lt; and Southern Company Energy Marketing &lt;SO.N&lt;.   Sprecher said continued liquidity would be ensured by the fact thatthe founding members will pay fees even if they do not trade and willface additional penalties if they fail to live up to their commitment totrade a minimum volume.   TRADERS STILL TO DO OWN CLEARING   As well as increasing awareness of market moves, Sprecher believestrading over the Internet could boost trading profits.\"The economics (of the system) will be driven by the fact that apaperless back office can really save a lot of money,\" he said.   However such savings on trading the ICE appear some way off giventhat dealers will initially have to continue using their own clearingsystems, as they do in current OTC systems.   Under the ICE, once a deal has been struck both counterparties willreceive an electronic deal ticket which will then go through thoseplayers' own risk management systems.   But the exchange is eager to look at ways of introducing its ownclearing system.   \"No one really knows how at the moment,\" Sprecher said. \"There mightbe some hybrid between traditional exchange clearing and what now existspeer to peer.\"   In terms of participation costs, no membership fees will be incurredexcept those associated with trading. Membership is open to anycommercial market participant.   Each product will have its own published commission schedule, whichSprecher assessed at \"slightly below the best prices someone would payin the voice broker business\".

Hell, already seeing it in the West.   The system is just broken there.   interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.   definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be unbelievable.   who would have thunk it.

He is an extremely creative individual.   Whalley actually commented on him today as someone \"who thinks outside the box\".   Bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.   He has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.   As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.   He throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.   He pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for Enron.   In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within reason.   I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority.   I am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business.   Bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital.   I place very high confidence in Bill not conducting high risk trades.   Having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.   Just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty.I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread option he traded.   He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well.   There are a couple isolated products that Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.   This was one product.   Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing models created by the research group.   The problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations.   For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict.   Thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.   Obviously, we have this function in our pricing models.   I was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.   This has since been changed.   Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.   Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to Enron.   I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit.   I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances.   If you believe differently, please advise.Thanks, John\n"
