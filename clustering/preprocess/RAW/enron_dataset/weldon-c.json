D. King Power plant location:1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   Trucks need pumps.2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3\"?   3\"3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?   Standard or 3 inch disconnectsOutstanding issues:1) Full spec sheet---especially sodium and potassium guarantees   The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.   We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?   Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.3) Tank fill and beyond---why not the full 1MM gallons?   Need 2000K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue---tax evaluating   Dyed5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record8) Tank fill price---fixed or floating?

When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:Density at reference temperatureHeating Values at reference temperatureMaximum trace contaminant limits:\tchromium\tarsenic\tsiloxenes\tcopper corrosivity\tcetane index\tcetane numberThank you,Matt---",

In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.   Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.   The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI &amp; CMI.   The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.   The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.   The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, &amp; 4 for economic comparison purposes.Ray &lt;Embedded StdOleLink&lt;&lt;Embedded StdOleLink&lt;\n"

I have faxed the #2 Diesel Fuel specs along with those for jet fuel to Matt Tezyk who has been coordinating the effort to consolidate the spec.   He said he would share these with all the riight parties so the decision can be made as to whether we decide to take regular low-sulphur #2, jet fuel, or pursue some other path.Please let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,Charlie Weldon---"

This is unfortunate, and it's about tochange.   If you notice, despite the fact that GOPUSA.com has notpromoted the board at all, it has received a number of posting over thelast several months.Now, in our effort to really build a GOPUSA community, we are completelyredesigning the message board!   The new message board is called theGOPUSA.com Forum.   It uses much better software than we had before, andit is much more versatile:* Users will actually register and be assigned a password.   Thispassword will be sent to them so that e-mail addresses can't be bogus.The users e-mail address, however, does not have to appear on his/herposts.* There is a personal message section on the board in which a registereduser can leave a message for another registered user.* There is an Announcements section where GOPUSA.com can post new newsand information.* There are varying levels of \"members\" depending on how many posts auser has made.* There are icons incorporated on the board for many symbols.* There is a lot more as well...So, what we need to do is thoroughly test out the board.   My plan is tolaunch it with an announcement in the Monday morning edition of theEagle.   So we need to do as much testing as we can this week.   Then,late Saturday or Sunday, I'll clean out all the test messages, and openit up to you guys to start posting real messages.Here's what I'd like you to do:* Go to the GOPUSA.com Forum athttp:///gopusa.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.pl* Register with the Forum* You'll get a password which you can easily change to a differentpassword in your \"profile\"* Make some posts to the existing topics.   These posts don't have to berelated to the topic.   We're simply testing at this point.   The postcan, however, contain your opinions about the board, etc.* Please e-mail me if you can participate in the testing.* Please e-mail me (and post to the board) your ideas on topics.   Acould place for comparison is http:///www.freerepublic.com* Consider the idea on having state specific categories (a Californiasection, etc.) or just general categories like I have now.   Please giveme your thoughts on this.* Test out all the features you can on the board.   If you see graphicsthat don't \"fit\" with the layout, please let me know.   I'm customizingthe graphics to fit the GOPUSA.com theme, but I haven't changed all ofthem yet.* Don't comment on the fact that the links aren't working on the generalGOPUSA.com page that contains the Forum.   This is just a template of thenew layout, and it will be working Monday.Thank you so much for your help on this.   Time is of the essence, and Iapologize for the late start on this.   It was not the orignial plan.   Weare going to make a big effort to build a GOPUSA community, and I knowthe Forum will play a large role.Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.Bobby---***Robert R.

        " V Charles Weldon/HOU/ECT on 04/24/20001 01:10 PM ---From:\tEric Groves/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/24/20001 111:39 AMTo:\tV Charles Weldon/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:\t Subject:\tmore pricingWe are going to talk with Shankman tomorrow and so was wondering if you could refresh the prices for the collars in the attached file.   Fairly similar to what we priced yesterday, but we only have 2 volume increments.   Also, we need to price this as an annual deal with 1 exercise at the end of each calendar year.   (2010 would be exercised on 12/31/2010).   Also, we need to refresh the fixed price quotes on the last sheet in the attached file as well.   These prices I asked John Griffith about last friday.   Use tonights close if you don't mind.Please let me know if you have any questions,   Thanks again,eric \n"
