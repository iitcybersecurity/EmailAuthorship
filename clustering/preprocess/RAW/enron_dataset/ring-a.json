The looping and compression project will provide an additional 236,383 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.About 38 miles of new pipeline along the company's existing mainline system will be installed along with modifications to existing compressor stations in Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, according to the project plans. The project will go in service in the spring of 20002.Robust economic growth in the Southeast and development of significant new gas-fired power generation were the main forces driving the expansion. Southern Co. and Carolina Power and Light (CP&amp;L) agreed to purchase most of the capacity of the project. Southern purchased 140,000 Dth/d. CP&amp;L signed up for 75 MMcf/d. CP&amp;L also is planning to build a $1000 million, 82-mile intrastate lateral downstream of Sundance between Iredell and Richmond counties in North Carolina. The 30-inch-diameter lateral would have an initial capacity of 2000 MMcf/d with expansion capability up to 7000 MMcf/d.   \n"

However, at the local auction the going price for horses was   so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.   He figured that since he   had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his   surprise, the Donkey came in third. The   next day the racing form carried this headline, \"Preacher's Ass shows\". The Preacher was so pleased with the   Donkey that he entered it in the race again, and this time it won.   The next day the form said, \"Preacher's Ass, out in front!\"The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.   The newspaper printed this headline; \"Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass.\" This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. The headline next day read, \"Nun has the best Ass in town.\" The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to   dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy it for $10. Next day the paper said, \"Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks.\" They buried the Bishop the next day.\n"

Yet, my son, Shay, cannot&lt; learn things as other children do.   He cannot understand things as other&lt; children do. Where is God's plan in reflected in my son?\"&lt;&lt; The audience was stilled by the query.   The father continued. \"I&lt; believe,\"the father answered, \"that when God brings a child like Shay into&lt; the world, an opportunity to realize the Divine Plan presents itself. And it&lt; comes in the way people treat that child.\"&lt;&lt; Then, he told the following story:&lt;&lt; Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were&lt; playing baseball. Shay asked, \"Do you think they will let me play?\"   Shay's&lt; father knew that most boys would not want him on their team. But the father&lt; understood that if his son were allowed to play it would give him a&lt; much-needed sense of belonging.   Shay's father approached one of the boys on&lt; the field and asked if Shay could play.   The boy looked around for guidance&lt; from his teammates.&lt;&lt; Getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said, \"We are losing by&lt; six runs, and the game is in the eighth inning.   I guess he can be on our&lt; team and we'll try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning.\"&lt;&lt; In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was&lt; still behind by three.   At the top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove&lt; and played in the outfield. Although no hits came his way, he was obviously&lt; ecstatic just to be on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father&lt; waved to him from the stands.&lt;&lt; In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two&lt; outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base.   Shay was&lt; scheduled to be the next at-bat. Would the team actually let Shay bat at&lt; this juncture and give away their chance to win the game?&lt;&lt; Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat.&lt;&lt; Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible because Shay didn't even&lt; know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.&lt; However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved a few steps to&lt; lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact. The&lt; first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed.&lt;&lt; The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly toward&lt; Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground&lt; ball to the pitcher.&lt;&lt; The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown the&lt; ball to the first baseman.   Shay would have been out and that would have&lt; ended the game.   Instead, the pitcher took the ball and threw it on a high&lt; arc to right field, far beyond reach of the first baseman.&lt;&lt; Everyone started yelling, \"Shay, run to first. Run to first.\" Never in his&lt; life had Shay ever made it to first base.   He scampered down the baseline,&lt; wide-eyed and startled.   Everyone yelled \"Run to second, run to second!\"   By&lt; the time Shay was rounding first base, the right fielder had the ball.   He&lt; could have thrown the ball to the second baseman for a tag.   But the right&lt; fielder understood what the pitcher's intentions had been, so he threw the&lt; ball high and far over the third baseman's head.   Shay ran towards second&lt; base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases towards home.&lt;&lt; As Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned him&lt; in the direction of third base, and shouted, \"Run to third!\"   As Shay&lt; rounded third, the boys from both teams were screaming, \"Shay! Run home!\"&lt;&lt; Shay ran home, stepped on home plate and was cheered as the hero, for&lt; hitting a \"grand slam\" and winning the game for his team.&lt;&lt; \"That day,\" said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face,\"the&lt; boys from both teams helped bring a piece of the Divine Plan into this&lt; world.\"&lt;&lt; And now, a footnote to the story. We all send thousands of jokes through&lt; e-mail without a second thought, but when it comes to sending messages&lt; regarding life choices, people think twice about sharing.   The crude,&lt; vulgar, and sometimes the obscene pass freely through cyberspace, but public&lt; discussion of decency is too often suppressed in school and the workplace.&lt; If you are thinking about forwarding this message, you are probably thinking&lt; about which people on your address list aren't the \"appropriate\" ones to&lt; receive this type of message.&lt;&lt; The person who sent this to you believes that we can all make a difference.&lt; We all have thousands of opportunities a day to help realize God's plan.   So&lt; many seemingly trivial interactions between two people present us with a&lt; choice: Do we pass along a spark of the Divine?   Or do we pass up that&lt; opportunity, and leave the world a bit colder in the process?&lt;&lt; You have two choices now:&lt;&lt; 1. Delete this.&lt;&lt; 2. Forward it to the people you care about.&lt;&lt; You know the choice I made.\n"

What are you thinking about?2. Do you love me?3. Do I look fat?4. Do you think she is prettier than me?5. What would you do if I died?What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteedto explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e.,tells the truth). Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzedbelow, along with possible responses.QUESTION #1: WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?The proper answer to this, of course, is: \"I'm sorry if I've been quiet dear.   I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful,caring, intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you.\"This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, whichmost likely is one of the following:1. Hockey.2. Sex.3. How fat you are.4. How much prettier she is than you.5. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, whoonce told Peg, \"If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be talking to you!\"QUESTION #2: DO YOU LOVE ME?The proper response is: \"YES\" or, if you feel a more detailed answer isin order, \"Yes, dear.\"Inappropriate responses include:1. Oh Yeah, shit loads.2. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?3. That depends on what you mean by love.4. Does it matter?5. Who? Me?QUESTION #3: DO I LOOK FAT?The correct answer is an emphatic: \"Of course not!\"Among the incorrect answers are:1. Compared to what?2. I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin.3. A little extra weight looks good on you.4. I've seen fatter.5. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would spend the insurance money if you died.QUESTION #4: DO YOU THINK SHE'S PRETTIER THAN ME?Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: \"Of course not!\"Incorrect responses include:1. Yes, but you have a better personality.2. Not prettier, but definitely thinner.3. Not as pretty as you were when you were her age.4. Define pretty.5. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I wouldspend the insurance money if you died.QUESTION #5: WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I DIED?A definite no-win question. The real answer, of course, is \"Buy Corvetteand Boat\". No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least anhour of follow-up questions, usually along these lines:Woman: Would you get married again?Man: Definitely not!Woman: Why not? Don't you like being married?Man: Of course I do.Woman: Then why wouldn't you remarry?Man: Okay, I'd get married again.Woman: You would?(WITH A HURT LOOK ON HER FACE) Would you sleep with herin our bed?Man: Where else would we sleep?Woman: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures ofher?Man: That would seem like the proper thing to do.Woman: And would you let her use my golf clubs?Man: She can't use them; she's left-handed.Woman: ---silence---Man: shit\n"

One day when I was feeling gloomy, And in a melancholy mood, I heard a   voice from out the gloom say 'Cheer up, things could be worse.'   So I   cheered up and sure enough, things got worse!\"   THE NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY:   Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out   section of   forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The   deceased   male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his   back, flippers, and facemask.   A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from   massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive   identification.   Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver   ended up in the middle of a forest fire.   It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the person went for a   diving trip off the coast some 20 miles from the forest. The fire   fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in   a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from   the ocean and then flown to the forest fire and emptied.   You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the   Pacific, the next he was doing the breaststroke in a fire-dip-bucket 3000   feet in the air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10\" of the fire.   Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.   (This article was taken from the California Examiner, March 20,   &lt; 19998)   STILL THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY?   A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in   the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it   accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handle   bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the   motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.   The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her   husband lying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next   to him, and the shattered patio door.   The wife ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance.   Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the   several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her   husband.   After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital,   the wife up righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas   was   spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the   petrol, and threw the towels in the toilet. The man was treated and released   to come home.   Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the   damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom,   sat   down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette,   he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while seated.   His wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her   husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying   on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering   burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin.   His wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same   paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The   paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began   carrying   him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street   accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the   husband had burned himself.   She told them, and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of   them slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell   down   the remaining stairs and broke his arm.   (Taken from a Florida Newspaper)   Having a bad day? Just remember, it could be worse...   A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking   frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards   the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current   she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking   his   arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening to   his Walkman!   And finally...   Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a letter   bomb. It came back with \"Return to Sender\" stamped on it.   Forgetting it   was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.   Now, your day's not so bad, is it ...? &lt;&lt;   \n"

        " Andrea Ring/HOU/ECT on 01/16/20001 12:49 PM ---   Michele Winckowski @ ENRON   01/16/20001 09:47 AMTo: Andrea Ring/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Fwd: FW: Advice on Self-DefenseI THINK THIS IS THE SAME GUY WE HAD IN OMAHA - HE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WITH SOLID INFORMATION.Hi, ladies,   I just finished taking the most amazing self-defenseclass, sponsored by Shandwick, and I wanted to share some really valuable info with you before it goes out of my head.   The guy who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St. Louis one night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped.   He started a women's group and began teaching these classessoon after. This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice a year with Steven Segall. He and the   others in this group interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in   prison on what they look for and here's some interesting facts:The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.   They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed.   They are also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short hair are not common targets.   The second thing men look for is clothing.   They will look for women who's clothing is easy to remove quickly.   The #1 outfit they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut.They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through theirpurse or doing other activities while walking because they are offguard and can be easily overpowered.The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman isin the early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. The number one place women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store parking lots. Number two is office parking lots/garages. Number three is public rest rooms.The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a womanand quickly move her to a second location where they don't have toworry about getting caught.   Only 2% said they carried weapons because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon is 15-20 years. If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to realize that going after you isn't worth it because it will be time-consuming. These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas, or other similar objects that can be used from a distance, intheir hands.   Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon.   So, the idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it. Several defense mechanisms he taught us are:* If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage   or with you in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face   and ask them a question, like what time is it, or make general   small talk, I can't believe it is so cold out here, we're in   for a bad winter.   Now you've seen their face and could identify   them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target.* If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front   of you and yell Stop or Stay back!   Most of the rapists this man   talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed   that she would not be afraid to fight back.   Again, they are   looking for an EASY target.   If you carry pepper spray (this   instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him   wherever he goes), yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it   out will be a deterrent.* If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you   can by outsmarting them. If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist   back so your hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and   twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away. It is hard to   hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way. They stumble   toward you and you stumble back, so you can use that momentum to   bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the   forehead, nose or teeth.* If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker   either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper   inner thigh. HARD. One woman in a class this guy taught told him   she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her   and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle   strands - the guy needed stitches.   Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it.   It hurts.* After the initial hit, always go for the groin. I know from a   particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's balls   (sorry to be graphic) it is extremely painful. You might think that   you'll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but the   thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman   who will not cause a lot of trouble.   Start causing trouble and he's out of there.* When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers   and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing   down on them as possible. The instructor did it to me without using   much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked   audibly.Of course the things we always hear still apply.   Always be aware ofyour surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You may feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy really was trouble.Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff thatcould save her life. - pic06208.pcx - pic021115.pcx\n"

        " Andrea Ring/HOU/ECT on 04/03/20001 03:03 PM ---   \tFrom:   Karen D McIlvoy   03/27/20001 12:32 PM To: ragan.bond@bhlp.comcc:   (bcc: Andrea Ring/HOU/ECT)Subject: Fwd: Witch's Brew   Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a   neighboring kingdom.   The monarch could have killed him, but was moved by   Arthur's youthful happiness.   So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult   question.   Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer;   if, after a   year, he still had no   answer, he would be killed.   The question was: \"What do women really want?\"   Such a question would   perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed an   impossible query.   Since it was better than death, however, he accepted the   monarchs proposition to have an answer by year's end.   He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, the   prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester.   In all, he spoke   with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What most   people did tell him, was to consult the old witch, as only she would know   the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous throughout   the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.   The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to talk   to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept her   price first:   The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of the   Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend!   Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had   only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises. He had   never run across such a repugnant creature.   He refused to force his friend   to marry her and have to endure such a burden.   Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur.   He told him that   nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the   preservation of the Round   Table.   Hence, their wedding was   proclaimed, and the witch   answered Arthur's question:   \"What a woman really   wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life.\"   Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that   Arthur's life would be spared.   And so it went.   The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total freedom.   What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief and   anguish.   Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old witch   put her worst manners on display.   She ate with her hands, belched and passed   gas, and made everyone uncomfortable as ever.   The wedding night approached:   Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific   night, entered the bedroom.   What a sight awaited!   The most beautiful woman   he'd ever seen lay before him!   Gawain was astounded and asked what had   happened.   The beauty replied that since he   had been so kind to her (when   she was a witch), half the time she would   be her horrible, deformed self,and   the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self.   Which would he want   her to be during the day and which during the night?   What a cruel question!   Gawain began to think of his predicament:   during the day a beautiful woman to show off to   his friends, but at night,   in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch?   Or would he prefer having   by day   a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful   woman   to enjoy many intimate   moments?   What would you do?   What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read   until you've made your own   choice.   The Answer: * *   Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself.   Upon hearing this, she announced that she would   be beautiful all the time,   because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own life.   What is the moral of this story?   The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly, smart or   dumb. Underneath it all, she's still a witch. \n"

One day, the women decided&lt;   that, when the boss left, they would leave right behind her.&lt;&lt;   The brunette was thrilled to be home early. She did a little gardening,&lt;   spent playtime with her son, and went to bed early.   The redhead was&lt;   elated to be able to get in a quick workout at the spa before meeting a&lt;   dinner date.&lt;&lt;   The blonde was happy to get home early and surprise her husband, but when&lt;   she got to her bedroom, she heard a muffled noise from inside.

Sunday we went to brunch at Pappasitos and I left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table   -   so it cost me $8000.000 to replace - I was so mad at myself (you know how cheap I am).   I was off Monday &amp; Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.   I finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.   My house looks really nice (to nice for us actually).   We finally got our chandelier for the dining room - it is so beautiful.   I made reservations for Thankgiving and was sad when Don told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because Lynn has to work.   I hope we can stay with you as I understand Carla &amp; Russ are not doing well.   Maybe we can eat at the Rose - just   you &amp; me.   Well better go.   Love you and take care of yourself.\n"

Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedule accordingly.   Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go back to what they did before.   We have spent a lot of time and money getting brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you all to have a chance to try it out.   Just give this schedule a try for a while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.   Thanks!Ann MoraTammi DePaolis01/04/20001 01:56 PMTo: Ann Mora/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Re: Body Shop Group Exercise Schedule   Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in the evening?   I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but only one class offered in the evening.   There   are numerous people who were hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we are only able to work out in the evenings, period.   In addition,   we were hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both Monday and   Wednesday.   Is it possible that   if you do not have very much participation for the \"total body conditioning class\"   on Tuesday &amp; Thursday you could replace it with another spin class and another bootcamp class.   Or maybe the \"total body conditioning class\" could be moved to   Monday and Wednesday and then it would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday &amp; Thrusday.   Then if you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That would be wonderful.   Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening   an \"ab lab\" class could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?   Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class   acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.   If   there is enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set up?   Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons.   \n"

It is (was) so good to hear from you!   I'm sorry about all the problems PG&amp;E has had but I hope it hasn't dampened your spirits to much.   It will all work out in the end.   Dick &amp; I are still here.   We were not smart and only sold about a third of our Enron stock when the price was above eighty so we have just been riding it down.   I guess we will be here for awhile.   I'm glad you got your house done - that is such a good feeling.   We only have a few things left to do inside.   Then we get to start on the backyard and patio.   It never ends!   We had a very mild winter and it is just starting to get warm - I'm already dreading the heat.   I hope you can find a place to do ceramics.   I used to go with my mom every Saturday when I lived in Omaha.   At first I just went to spend time with her but I ended up really enjoying it - very relaxing.   I was very slow - in the year I was there I only finished two projects.   I still display them proudly on the appropriate holiday.   Are you going home for Easter?   This Friday I am going to have nasal surgery - something I have been putting off for years.   I am not looking forward to it.   Once again this highly predictable market is moving so I better go!   Take care and I'll try to call you when I get back from R&amp;R .Sorry it took so long to write! \n"

I'm so glad you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling during the holidays.   Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!   I guess I'll be one of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.   We went home for Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.   Will you be coming to Houston in the near future?   If you do you are more than welcome to stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!   Better go but let's meet like this more often!

That very&lt; day the lady cut her tongue on the envelope. A week later, she noticed&lt; an abnormal swelling of her tongue. She went to the doctor, and they&lt; found nothing wrong. Her tongue was not sore or anything.&lt;&lt; A couple of days later, her tongue started to swell more, and it began&lt; to get really sore, so sore, that she could not eat. She went back to&lt; the hospital, and demanded something be done. The doctor, took an&lt; x-ray of her tongue, and noticed a lump. He prepared her for minor&lt; surgery. When the doctor cut her tongue open, a live roach crawled&lt; out. There were roach eggs on the seal of the envelope. The egg was&lt; able to hatch inside of her tongue, because of her saliva. It was warm&lt; and moist...&lt;&lt; This is a true story reported on CNN Andy Hume wrote: Hey, I used to&lt; work in an envelope factory. You wouldn't believe the...things that&lt; float around in those gum applicator trays. I haven't licked an&lt; envelope for years&lt;&lt;\n"
