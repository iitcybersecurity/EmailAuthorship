The headings willbe lined up when Trish adds the art and ads.   A calendar, also, which is inthe next e-mail.I'll appreciate your comments by the end of tomorrow, Monday.There are open issues which I sure hope get resolved before printing:1.   I'm waiting for a reply from Mike Bass regarding tenses on the Home Depotarticle.   Don't know if there's one developer or more and what the name(s)is/are.2.   Didn't hear back from Ted Weir regarding minutes for July's water boardmeeting.   I think there are 2 meetings minutes missed, 6/222 and July.3.   Waiting to hear back from Cheryl Hanks about the 7/6 City Council and 6/7BOA meetings minutes.4.   Don't know the name of the folks who were honored with Yard of the Month. They're at 509 Narcissus.I'm not feeling very good about the missing parts but need to move onschedule!   I'm also looking for a good dictionary to check the spellings ofettouffe, tree-house and orneryness.   (Makes me feel kind of ornery, come tothink about it!)Please let me know if you have revisions.   Hope your week is starting outwell.'Nita - AUGUST.WPD\n"

My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.   We can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did not want to forget them.   1.   When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.   2.   Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes at a late time?   We could do the rest over the phone.3.   On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 111:45 am, but it would affect customers whose noms are due at 111:30.   I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.   I'm sure there are a lot of others.Thanks.\n"

It came from 18.5% to 17.5% peryear level, setting downward bias until next meeting on July 18-19. This will atleast influence favorably the local markets, except foreign exchange in theshort run, boosting the mood of the society which may follow business leaderswho have already declared such one as a very positive move to the economicgrowth side.Assuming the move as first of others, despite not so large for the comingmonths, consumers expectations may boost promoting additional economic growth inthe second semester. Argentina would eventually benefit in such scenario sinceit may export more to Brazil, helping its difficult situation by generation ofadditional reserves.At this moment, what local players are trying to do is to understand therational of such move, which overcome the forecast of even the most optimisticof the analysts.The authority to justify the stronger move mentioned inflation forecastsdeclining. The last inflation targeting report of the Central Bank shows aforecast of 6.3% for the official index the IPCA in comparison with theinflation-target of 6% for 2000 year. In fact, the new forecast in the market is5.5% for 2000, in the best view. Additionally, the last inflation targetingreport shows a forecast of 3.3% against a target of 4% for 20001 year. However,market argues that this do not justifies the intensity of the decline, 1000 basispoints against markets maximum expectation of a 50 bp reduction. So, there mustbe other reasons to be understood.We can list some other positive reasons. Fiscal primary surplus performance isovercoming even the IMF goals. The cost of funding abroad is declining, as shownby yesterday?s successful sovereign placement of an EUR 750 millions Eurobond toyield 9.2%, comparably less than last September similar issue at 111.53%. Wecould include the better mood on the US economic growth adjustment; Argentinaresistance to change the dollar pegged currency regime by new fiscal measuresand some better mood in the world growth as potential factors affectingexpectations. However, even all that does not justify the COPOM move for themajority of local market makers. They agree in the direction of the move, butnot on the intensity and mainly not on the speed of the interest rates decline.We can list two other potential reasons for such move. One is related to aprobable Standard &amp; Poors upgrade on Brazil in the coming months, which mayeventually be followed by Moody`s later. The second is a political influence toboost government?s popularity and I will risk saying even to make FinanceMinister Pedro Malan?s candidacy to the Presidency in 20002 feasible. On thatevaluation see the analisys of a political think tank based in Brasilia: ?That?sthe most important political movement of the year. On political terms it becameclear a favourable economic scenario, rebounding President Cardoso popularityand the chances of political victory increasing a lot, all that not ment&lt;oningthat the political noise in Brasilia will diminish\".Nicola TingasJune 21, 2000.\n"

I'm slated to begin work onthe Monday the 18th, and must say I am VERY excited to get started.   It willbe an honor to work for Enron.   I know I am just beginning a long andproductive career with an amazing company.I received your email address from Molly Magee.   I had a few questionsregarding Holiday plans and start-day preparation and she directed me tothis email address.   I know you are very busy, so please reply at yourconvenience.My first question regards holiday planning.   If I remember correctly, it wasmentioned someone was working or on call one weekend a month.   It may be tooearly to tell, but if I'm scheduled to work that weekend (December 222nd -25th) I would like to make plans accordingly.   My mother in Missouri can bevery persistent (aka annoying) and wants to know my plans.Also, I would like to put my name first on volunteers to work that weekend.However, I understand my lack of experience may prevent me from acceptingthat responsibility this soon.   If I will not be working, may I ask that youtell me what days I will have off.   I need to know if I should buy a planeticket, get my car serviced for the drive, or make plans in Houston.Finally, I've bought a training video covering Excel and begun reading abook titled \"Trading Natural Gas\", by Fletcher J. Sturm (former seniortrader of natural gas derivatives for Enron Capital and Trade).   I want tostart contributing from day one and would like to know if there is anythingI can do to facilitate that.   Any other programs, books, push-up andcrunches, you could suggest would be aggressively pursued.I look forward to seeing you again next week Mr. Gay.   My schedule on Mondayappears to be; \"New Hire Training\" from 8:000 am to 4:000 pm.   If possible, Ican be on your floor early to observe, leave for training from 8 to 4, thenreturn at 4:10 pm and stay until the close of business if you like?Thank you.Respectfully,Daniel D.

The issue with the county hasbeen resolvedHere is a revised version\"The developer of the Home Depot/ Target Center on FM2094 is proceeding onplan.The developers have requested that the Texas Department of Transportationmodify the new FM 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light atMiller Road. The Water District has agreed to also include the new center intheir district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain otherconditions. The Developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for bothrequests. The City passed a resolution to support both requests by thedeveloper and to express our intention to annex the property once thedeveloper closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the City.The County and the Developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part,about 21000 feet, of Hanson Road- - a $2000,000 cost. This is a significantexpense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.But the project is proceeding as planned. The developers are still planningon closing on the property in the next few weeks.\"Mike Bass\n"

Burns' clothes caught on something, however, and&lt;&lt;&lt;   the other man found Burns \"wrapped in the drive shaft.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 3: [Hickory Daily Record]&lt;&lt;&lt;   Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in&lt;&lt;&lt;   December in Newton, N.C. Awakening to the sound of a ringing&lt;&lt;&lt;   telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed&lt;&lt;&lt;   instead a Smith Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he drew&lt;&lt;&lt;   it to his ear.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 4: [UPI, Toronto]&lt;&lt;&lt;   Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a&lt;&lt;&lt;   downtown Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his&lt;&lt;&lt;   shoulder and plunged 24   floors to his death. A police spokesman&lt;&lt;&lt;   said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the courtyard of the Toronto&lt;&lt;&lt;   Dominion Bank Tower early Friday evening as he was explaining the&lt;&lt;&lt;   strength of the building's windows to visiting law students. Hoy&lt;&lt;&lt;   previously has conducted demonstration of window strength&lt;&lt;&lt;   according to police reports. Peter Lawyers, managing partner of&lt;&lt;&lt;   the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that&lt;&lt;&lt;   Hoy was \"one of the best and brightest\" members of the 2000-man&lt;&lt;&lt;   association.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 5: [Bloomsburg News Service]&lt;&lt;&lt;   A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for&lt;&lt;&lt;   the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no&lt;&lt;&lt;   mark on his body but an autopsy showed large amounts of methane&lt;&lt;&lt;   gas in his system. His diet had consisted primarily of beans and&lt;&lt;&lt;   cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right&lt;&lt;&lt;   combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep&lt;&lt;&lt;   from breathing the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed.&lt;&lt;&lt;   Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't&lt;&lt;&lt;   have been fatal.   But the man was shut up in his near air-tight&lt;&lt;&lt;   bedroom.   According to the article, \"He was a big man with a huge&lt;&lt;&lt;   capacity for creating \"this deadly gas.\" Three of the rescuers got&lt;&lt;&lt;   sick and one was hospitalized.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 6: [The News of the Weird.]&lt;&lt;&lt;   Michael Anderson Godwin made news of the Weird posthumously. He&lt;&lt;&lt;   had spent several years awaiting South Carolina's electric chair&lt;&lt;&lt;   on a murder conviction before having his sentence reduced to life&lt;&lt;&lt;   in prison. Whilst sitting on a metal toilet in his cell and&lt;&lt;&lt;   attempting to fix his small TV set, he bit into a wire and was&lt;&lt;&lt;   electrocuted.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE NO. 7: [\"The Indianapolis Star\"].&lt;&lt;&lt;   A cigarette lighter may have triggered fatal explosion in Dunkirk,&lt;&lt;&lt;   Indiana.   A Jay County man using a cigarette lighter to check the&lt;&lt;&lt;   barrel of a muzzle loader was killed Monday night when the weapon&lt;&lt;&lt;   discharged in his face, sheriff's investigators said. Gregory&lt;&lt;&lt;   David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home about&lt;&lt;&lt;   111:30 pm.   Investigators said Pryor was cleaning a 54-caliber&lt;&lt;&lt;   muzzle loader that had not been firing properly. He was using the&lt;&lt;&lt;   lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder ignited.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 8: [Reuters, Mississauga, Ontario] A man cleaning a&lt;&lt;&lt;   bird Feeder on the balcony of his condominium apartment in this&lt;&lt;&lt;   Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death.   Stefan&lt;&lt;&lt;   Macko, 555, was standing on a wheeled chair when the accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer of the Peel regional police.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony,\" Honer&lt;&lt;&lt;   said.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No.9: [Arkansas Democrat Gazette] Two local men were&lt;&lt;&lt;   seriously injured when their pick-up truck left the road and&lt;&lt;&lt;   struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday&lt;&lt;&lt;   morning. Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 333, of Des Arc and&lt;&lt;&lt;   Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious&lt;&lt;&lt;   condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the&lt;&lt;&lt;   two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On an&lt;&lt;&lt;   overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights&lt;&lt;&lt;   malfunctioned.   The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on&lt;&lt;&lt;   the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was&lt;&lt;&lt;   not available,   Wallis noticed that the .222 caliber bullet from&lt;&lt;&lt;   his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering&lt;&lt;&lt;   wheel column.   Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again&lt;&lt;&lt;   began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on east-bound&lt;&lt;&lt;   toward the White River bridge. After traveling approximately 20&lt;&lt;&lt;   miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently&lt;&lt;&lt;   overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The&lt;&lt;&lt;   vehicle swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement and&lt;&lt;&lt;   striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from&lt;&lt;&lt;   the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other wound.&lt;&lt;&lt;   Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls&lt;&lt;&lt;   off or we might both be dead\" stated Wallis. \"I've been a trooper&lt;&lt;&lt;   for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a first for&lt;&lt;&lt;   me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   happened,\" said Snyder.

Gregory&lt;&lt;&lt;   David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home about&lt;&lt;&lt;   111:30 pm.   Investigators said Pryor was cleaning a 54-caliber&lt;&lt;&lt;   muzzle loader that had not been firing properly. He was using the&lt;&lt;&lt;   lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder ignited.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 8: [Reuters, Mississauga, Ontario] A man cleaning a&lt;&lt;&lt;   bird Feeder on the balcony of his condominium apartment in this&lt;&lt;&lt;   Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death.   Stefan&lt;&lt;&lt;   Macko, 555, was standing on a wheeled chair when the accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer of the Peel regional police.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony,\" Honer&lt;&lt;&lt;   said.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No.9: [Arkansas Democrat Gazette] Two local men were&lt;&lt;&lt;   seriously injured when their pick-up truck left the road and&lt;&lt;&lt;   struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday&lt;&lt;&lt;   morning. Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 333, of Des Arc and&lt;&lt;&lt;   Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious&lt;&lt;&lt;   condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the&lt;&lt;&lt;   two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On an&lt;&lt;&lt;   overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights&lt;&lt;&lt;   malfunctioned.   The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on&lt;&lt;&lt;   the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was&lt;&lt;&lt;   not available,   Wallis noticed that the .222 caliber bullet from&lt;&lt;&lt;   his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering&lt;&lt;&lt;   wheel column.   Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again&lt;&lt;&lt;   began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on east-bound&lt;&lt;&lt;   toward the White River bridge. After traveling approximately 20&lt;&lt;&lt;   miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently&lt;&lt;&lt;   overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The&lt;&lt;&lt;   vehicle swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement and&lt;&lt;&lt;   striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from&lt;&lt;&lt;   the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other wound.&lt;&lt;&lt;   Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls&lt;&lt;&lt;   off or we might both be dead\" stated Wallis. \"I've been a trooper&lt;&lt;&lt;   for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a first for&lt;&lt;&lt;   me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   happened,\" said Snyder.   Upon being notified of the wreck,&lt;&lt;&lt;   Lavinia, Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had caught&lt;&lt;&lt;   and did anyone get them from the truck.   (Way to go, Lavinia!)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;___&lt;Get more from your time online.

The issue detailed in the attached of whether WestLB will indemnify GEII against actions of the Enron entity acting as \"Agent.\"   Rob Gay is reviewing this issue.   This issue would impact Section 20.1(a).2.   The inclusion of certain language that Enron has requested which would more clearly establish that GEII's indemnity obligation includes consequential damage claims by third parties.   The language at issue appears in Sections 20.1(b) and 27.2.At Brett Wiggs' request, Cheryl Costa is discussing the above issues with GEII.

We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's transport to be close to $1 million/ month.2.   I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her here.   If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our customers.   The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.3.   The spreads out West have been huge this summer.   We were able to take advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very difficult time.4.   When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on management duties.   5.   Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day off.   She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several different jobs at a time.6.   The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.   I would estimate that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million to the desk.\n"

I'd have nothing to play with. A girl phoned me the other day and said ... \"Come on over, there's nobody home.\" I went over. Nobody was home. During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the other night she called me from a hotel. One day as I came home early from work ... I saw a guy jogging naked. I said to the guy ... \"Hey buddy, why are you doing that?\" He said, \"Because you came home early.\" Its been a rough day. I got up this morning ... put on a shirt and a button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom. I was such an ugly kid...When I played in the sandbox the cat kept covering me up. I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a radio. I was such an ugly baby ... My mother never breast fed me. She told me that she only liked me as a friend. I'm so ugly ... My father carries around the picture of the kid who came with his wallet. When I was born ... the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father \"I'm very sorry...We did everything we could...But he pulled through.\" I'm so ugly ... My mother had morning sickness...AFTER I was born. I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof. Once when I was lost ... I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find my parents. I said to him ... \"Do you think we'll ever find them?\" He said \"I don't know kid ... there are so many places they can hide.\" My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday. I'm so ugly ... I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd get. I went to see my doctor. \"Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in the mirror, I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me?\" He said \"I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.\" I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.\n"

Do you have any comments?I've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution inthe southwestern portion of the US.   Summarized below is their collectiveresponse:   1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over theinterstate sale and distribution of natural gas.   The Department ofTransportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resultingfrom the gas explosion.   2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area --- currently it isat $   17.111___ for 30-day _Jan'01___.   The reason prices are high is due to theexcessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.   Thus,gas is flowing into California --- the only way gas will flow east away fromCalifornia is in response to higher prices.   3.   Enron is not \"holding back supplies to the area\".   Enron is not aproducer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does nothave or utilize storage capacity in this area.   Also, Enron controlspipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day--- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).The dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketingsubsidiary of El Paso Gas.   Moreover, there are numerous marketers ofnatural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility andliquidity.   Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence theprice of physical suppliles in the area.   4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,winter) periods, not annual periods.   And, the winter season for whichmarketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (noton December 1 as the note below suggests).   5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies tothe area.   Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in thebuying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gassupplies.   Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,making margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron wouldbe disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold backphysical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying andselling of positions in natural gas.\"Lowe, Carol\" &lt;CPLowe@NationalGypsum.com&lt; on 111/30/2000 04:46:56 PMTo:   \"Richard D. Rathvon (E-mail)\" &lt;Richard.D.Rathvon@enron.com&lt;cc:   \"Kellie Metcalf (E-mail)\" &lt;kellie_metcalf@enron.net&lt;Subject:   West Coast GasRich,The following information was included in an email that was sent to ourexecutives and CEO.   The tone leaves a negative impression for Enron.   Canyou or someone at Enron comment on Enron's role or lack thereof withrespectto this item?   I am afraid this will taint our plans if not addressedquickly.   I want to circulate Enron's side of the story.CarolExcerpt from email circulated today:Due to the lingering effects of the August gas pipeline explosion in NewMexico that killed 10 people, coupled with some possible marketmanipulationby Enron, we're facing a potential problem at Phoenix in the short term andpossibly all three western plants longer term.   The pipeline which is ownedby El Paso Gas is back in operation, but is being limited to 50% ofcapacity.   Weather has turned cold, spiking demand for gas in the region.Enron appears to be holding back supplies to the area until at leastDecember 1st, when many of its contracts set the index price for thefollowing year.   Consequently, gas prices on the spot market in Arizona arehitting $25 per MMBTU.   The situation has caused several marketers todeclare force majeure.   If our marketer does so, we'll be curtailed.   Asyouprobably know, we don't have any backup fuel capabilities at these threeplants.   The U.S. Dept of Transportation controls this and is reported tobegetting involved.   Will keep you posted as it unfolds.\n"

      "body": "\nPhillip:   I agree with your conclusions, and we have already started addressing most of these issues.   First of all, I would like to say that all of the schedulers are performing at a high level, except for Hillary and Jan.   We have formally addressed Hillary's performance problems, and he is on   a schedule for improvement or he is out.   We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, and next week intend to formalize that also.   That Jan makes more than anyone else in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we are not getting a return on that investment.The rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already aware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc.   In Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end of the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable with her job performance.   Also, I intend to help smooth over other inequities through the bonus pool.In regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service during the rough time we've had when we were understaffed.   Bob Superty has supported this, and the information you provided him this last week should help in that endeavour.   Patti has had her pay increased this year after a salary survey was performed by our HR group.   I would like to point out that Patti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level.   Also, Patti would move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager.   I am not sure what the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go.   I would like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes on, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you and Mike still want to do.   As regards to the new hires:   yes, we can hire more like these at these prices.   We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, especially at these prices.   Patti did an excellent job hiring these individuals.   We have already started the process of looking for more like these to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan.   We also need to hire more for establishing a bigger physical presence in the west.   We probably need to sit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for expanding the desk.   Finally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver office do all nominations for IM Denver deals.   This has met stiff resistance in the past, and I do not know how ya'll feel about it, but I promised that I would bring it up. I personally feel that Denver and CIG would be isolated from us if the operations were to move to Denver.   If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.   Thanks.   \n"

We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and would like to proceed with a \"stress test\" (not to be confused with me showing up each day at work).   We would like to do 2 tests next week due to hardware and business restrictions.The test would be similar to those from late-19998 (ah, those were the days!).   We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for your staff!The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.   On the Login window, select server = \"ASE 12 Test\".   If you usual Production password does not work, try \"houston\".   If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says that fine, its just a test).   Each user should plan to run several sessions where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for those not able to participate during this time.   Please have your staff try to login some time Monday to insure they have access.The test script during the time period will be:12:000 - 1:30 Logistics:   pathing, nominating, running some reports12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:   pile inPlease let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very important test.   The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.   The less bid weeks with poor system performance the better!Thanks in advance for your help, d.n.\n"

Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would?   In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual \"re-entry\" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange?   OR is there additional information that you need to create the path that is not sitting in Contract Exchange?This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY.It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us your input!Thanks,Carrie\n"

The format isn't exactly pretty, but you'll be able to figure it out: ? The Real Debate Jim Lehrer:??? Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on these rules:? I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters. The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes. Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name of a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that strains the bounds of common sense? Gore:??? As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made??? love the way we have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage, the downtrodden have a clear choice in this election. My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans. I, on the other hand, want to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad lock box so they can't hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight. Mrs. Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me. Also, her poodle has arthritis. Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush, your rebuttal. Bush:??? Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.? I want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush. Lehrer:??? Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able to pronounce his name? Bush:??? The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick would present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then Dick would tell me which one to choose. You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New Mexico. Lehrer:??? Mr. Gore, your rebuttal. Gore:??? Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in. I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas in World War I.? I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War. And when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an iron clad lock box. Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple metaphors. Lehrer:??? Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security system? Gore:??? It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the year 22250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the next 10 years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with the child-proof cap. Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush? Bush:??? That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm going to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds. Lehrer:??? It's time for closing statements. Gore:??? I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me. Bush:??? It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but Republicans. Lehrer:???

This is especially noticeable when many paths are changed at once.   Even if it takes 1 - 2 seconds to refresh a path, changing 20 - 30 paths could cause the other scheduler on that pipe to wait for 30 - 45 seconds.We are developing a revised Auto Refresh option to let the scheduler pick whether they want Deal changes or Path changes (or both or neither).   To the scheduler, it will simply be a change on the Path Manager filter to replace the \"Auto Refresh\" checkbox with two checkboxes: - Auto Refresh Deals - Auto Refresh PathsOnce selected, this will be the default selection for the duration of that Path Manager session just as the current selection works.This will have no impact on how or when the data is stored in Unify, only whether another PC should have its numbers updated.   Nominations will process all paths regardless of this new selection.If our testing goes well, we may actually migrate this change to Unify Production tonight.   Please let me know if you know of any reason we should not go forward with this plan or have any questions or concerns.Thanks, d.n.\n"
