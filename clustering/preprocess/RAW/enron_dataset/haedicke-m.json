      "body": "\n1.   Enron Online Trading --- organized a legal team and solved enforceability and documentation issues around the world in a few short months for all the commodities traded by Enron.   2.   Developing New Businesses --- major contributions in developing and structuring coal, insurance, band-width and power plant transactions.   The groundwork has been laid to develop very profitable businesses in each of these areas.   3.   Aggressive Pursuit of Litigation Claims as a Plaintiff --- pursued Carolina Power &amp; Light , Shell/Meridian, TVA, Ft. James and many others.   Most have already settled with excellent results.   Successfully defended Wolfschlager, the last Panhandle case and Jolen.   4.   Lead Power Industry to Develop Master Power Agreement --- ENA lead the Edison Electric Institute coalition in developing   the first master power agreement.   ENA will benefit greatly in terms of dramatically lower transaction costs and greater liquidity.   5.   Reduced Legal Costs as Percentage of Earnings --- brought overall legal costs to less than 6% of EBIT in 1999, down from 8% in 19998, despite the upsurge in origination activity.   6.   Brought Finance and Corporate Legal Talent to Origination Deals --- as the origination work expanded dramatically and became much more complex, brought in more sophisticated legal talent to deals like UI and Peoples with great success.   7.   New Concept to Better Manage and Communicate Legal Risks --- developed the legal risk book concept to highlight where the largest buckets of legal risks were and where efforts should be focused.\n"

This resulted in a better understanding of legal risks such as the power contract risks.   There will be many collateral benefits for the company as a result of this new technology for legal risks such as better decision making on transactions and faster focus on solving problems.   2.   Developed and implemented new Chinese Wall Policy   ---   in the face of almost daily breaches of the then existing policy, a new policy was developed that is fashioned to fit the unique business of ECT.   The traders and originators helped design the policy and have \"bought in\".   Training was completed in June.   This new policy should reduce our SEC risk, while at the same time, allow us to take advantage of certain information.   3.   Lead power industry to develop a standardized form   ---   pushed ISDA and EEI to work with the major IOU's to jointly develop a standard master trading form for power.   The form is now 80% complete and is modeled after the ECT form.   The result will be a significant saving of legal time and effort and more transactions will be completed in the industry with less risk of an unintended default.   4.   Cutting edge legal work --- identified and solved many cutting edge legal questions in connection with the start-up of many ECT businesses.   These businesses include (i) the acquisition of competitive information, (ii) weather, coal, emissions, band- width and electronic trading, and (ii) acquisition of businesses through contract such as contemplated in the UI and the Peoples deals.   5.   Carolina Power &amp; Light --- after filing suit against CP&amp;L, acheiving a settlement at 90% of the value, despite difficult legal issues.   6.   Deals are Us   ---   lots and lots of deals done.   Legal built a closer relationship with several difficult groups with improved results for the company.\n"

The form is rapidly becoming the industry standard for North America and in the process dramatically lowering costs and increasing liquidity.   In October, we put an EEI into place with PG&amp;E with the result that Enron credit exposure is $50,000,000 less than under the prior contract.2.   New Legal Risk Rating Methodology --- implemented a legal rating system which simplifies the review of legal risks and makes it much easier to determine whether or not we are being appropriately compensated for the legal risks.3.   EWS Legal Website for Training --- website has gone live for training regarding all major EWS legal issues.

The place I was telling you about is Galeria Jacques Ardies.   Jacques' gallery is one of the two best (I think) specializing in contemporary Brazilian \"naif\" artists.   Most of his stuff is really interesting, vibrant, \"Brazilian\" pieces (many from the Northeast of Brazil where they have the greatest African influence and a very rich culture).   Kind of funky and \"out there,\"   but I really like it.   He also has some terrific textile works by Madeleine Colaco, an artist who has become very popular in the United States (we have one of her wall hangings in our den).Jacques' web site is at http:///ardies.com/quemingl.htm.   I don't think it is very representative of what you will find there, but take a look.There are plenty of other galleries that you can go to as well. Let's talk about what you want to see on the way down, and I will give it some thought.By the way,   I am scheduled to have lunch with Lance on Thursday, and I have a phone call into Alan asking for a time with him as well.   I will keep you posted.Regards,Randy\n"

I am providing you the following report, so as the facts and issues are clear.   I am taking the time to send you this report because I am concerned that Dan Fournier has demonstrated to date that he either does not understand the facts and issues (which is amazing) or believes he can obfuscate and resolve the issues through political maneuvering.You will recall that this matter kicked off late in Sept./000 with NGX giving us two days' notice that they were taking over control of the methodology for determining the prevalent gas indices effective Oct. 1/000.   You will also recall that the matter was of significant concern to John Lavorato and Greg Whaley, among others, and following a conference call with John, Greg, Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro and others, it was agreed that we would consider our legal remedies, including that I would prepare a draft stern letter to NGX advising them of our concerns and the potential for litigation with Enron, both for internal review and review by outside counsel.   I discussed the facts and the letter with Blakes (Dalton McGrath) who advised me that he would also be discussing the matter with a competition law partner in Toronto.   In the end Blakes had some minor comments on the letter and provided a cover letter confirming that in the circumstances we had a difficult put provable case.One issue raised by the letter was the potential involvement of NGX's shareholders, for a number of reasons, including:   (i) NGX had only two shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Gruppen, who to our knowledge controlled the mind and management of NGX;   (ii) OM Gruppen is in the business around the world of purchasing or creating electronic exchanges and had recently purchased its position in NGX from Westcoast;   Westcoast is the sole shareholder of Engage Energy, a energy trading competitor;   (ii) NGX's transaction for acquiring control of the indices was an aggressive, structured attack designed to cause harm to EOL and regain market share that EOL had taken away; and, (iv) NGX is a limited liability entity with little in hard assets and therefore may have been judgment proof.   Obviously, if the evidence or commercial/strategic reasons warranted not proceeding against the shareholders at any time, it was our intention not to continue to proceed against them.In short, Blakes was aware from the outset of our intention to involve Westcoast in any litigation.As expected, we did not receive a satisfactory response to our letter to NGX, and between late Sept./000 and Nov. 29/000, the date we filed the lawsuit and applied for injunctive relief, I had countless further discussions with Blakes to draft, and redraft, and redraft again, a Statement of Claim and Motion documents, all of which clearly involved Westcoast as a named defendant.Although the Court would not grant an injunction \"ex parte\", an aggressive timeline was established for filing affidavits and briefs, completing cross-examinations, etc. with the injunction application set for Dec. 20/000, to our strategic advantage.We were proceeding vigorously on this basis when to my surprise I received a phone call from Dan Fournier on Dec. 4/01 (9 weeks into the matter) to advise me that there was a \"legal\" conflict problem involving Westcoast, who is occasionally represented out of Blakes' Toronto office by Glenn Leslie.I explained to Dan that if there was a conflicts problem between Enron and Westcoast, and although I was willing to do what I could in the circumstances, I was extremely concerned as to what could be done at that stage prior to the injunction hearing, noting the conflicts problem was of Blakes own making.   Indeed it seemed it was the problem of a Toronto-based partner who did not pay enough attention at the outset to look after his firm's and his own client's interests, which then needed to be resolved on an after-the-fact basis.Although the problem was initially misleadingly presented to me by Dan as a legal conflict on the basis of Blakes having \"certain confidential information regarding Westcoast\", which I suspected to be a justification rather than the truth, when probed, Dan admitted that the conflict was a business conflict rather than a legal conflict.Nonetheless, it was suggested by Dan that Blakes could proceed if Enron discontinued the action against Westcoast, which obviously was not advice given in Enron's interest.I responded that this was not only unacceptable from a strategic if not legal position, and it was emphasized by me to Dan as being unnecessary and meaningless for the purposes of the injunction application, as the injunction was being sought against NGX and Canadian Enerdata, and no immediate remedy was being sought against Westcoast.Nonetheless, and as a favor to Blakes, I agreed that if Blakes acted on the injunction only (which, as noted, did not involve Westcoast) scheduled for Dec. 20th, I would transition the file to another firm immediately after the injunction, in an orderly manner that did not adversely affect Enron's interests.This result was not apparently acceptable to Blakes.   Late that evening I was advised by Dan that a call was being had at Blakes first thing the next morning involving Blakes' Chairman, Blakes' Managing Partner, the Westcoast responsible partner (Glenn Leslie) and the Enron responsible partner (Dan Fournier) to discuss the issue, and if it could not be resolved satisfactorily, Dalton McGrath, who is a more junior partner, would likely be held accountable.Unsatisfied that my relationship with Dalton McGrath was being put into issue, and after reviewing the matter that evening at the time and inconvenience of Milnthorp at home, I called Dan first thing (7:000 am) the next morning to nonetheless reiterate to him that I would not only undertake to relocate the file, but I would try to do my best to move the file if possible ASAP, even BEFORE the injunction application, provided I could be satisfied that it could done in a way that was not adverse to Enron's interests.Again, my unusual and more than reasonable accommodations to solve a problem of Blakes own making were not apparently satisfactory, as after the Blakes internal management call, I was advised late that next morning by Dan that:(a)   Blakes had decided that, regardless of our wishes, the file must be transferred to another firm ASAP, such that, although Blakes would assist in the transition and the pending cross examination of Jon MacKay and Seabron Adamson, Blakes would have no involvement in the briefs to be filed nor in appearing at the injunction application, and would cease immediately to appear as solicitors of record, notwithstanding that the injunction was then for only a few business days hence under a greatly abbreviated court ordered timeline for examinations, briefs, etc.;   finding and educating replacement counsel would have to be done at year end, with extraordinary demands on replacement counsel (not to mention Enron's other year end commercial business concerns, requiring better use and allocation of our resources).(b)   In making its decision, Blakes had considered: - the relative complexity of the Enron vs. Westcoast work (I would have assumed Enron would have won this one.) - relative annual billings (I would have assume, and it was later confirmed to me, that Enron's annual billings were more than 2-3x Westcoast's for the past 3 years.) - relative strategic importance to Blakes (Enron is the only international, Fortune 5000 firm represented by Blakes out of its Calgary office.   I also would have assumed that Blakes Toronto has an interest in the deregulating Ontario power markets, in which Enron expects to be a market leader.   I also would have assumed that Blakes would have appreciated the increased profile that Enron has given it in the pulp and paper industry, the gas industry, the power industry, the insolvency industry, the derivatives and commodity trading markets, and in other jurisdictions such as in the Province of Quebec, in the Province of British Columbia, in Houston and with other counsel which historically act for Enron.) - its policy not to sue established clients (Although admirable and a policy with which I agree, I assume it was weighed against what must also be a long standing and overriding policy of not dumping established clients, especially having regard to ethical obligations; the immediacy of the matter; the time of year; the business rather than legal conflict; Enron's more than reasonable offers to move the file ASAP under its own control but even prior to the injunction application; the various misdirections and excuses; the fact that Blakes, and particularly the Westcoast responsible partner, knew or ought to have known of the conflict for approx. 9 weeks; and, most importantly, that Blakes problem was one of its own internal making.   Simply put, Blakes did not have the luxury of strictly relying on such a lofty principle in the circumstances.)&amp;copy;   The arrangement had been pre-approved by Westcoast.   In other words, not only did Enron not have a say in the matter, its litigation adversary had all the say.In short, it is difficult to conceive how on any reasonable basis Blakes came to its decision, or decided to communicate its decision in the way it did.   The situation was of Blakes making, Enron had given Blakes a reasonable way out, and, with minimal fortitude by Blakes, and commercial reasonableness and respect of Westcoast towards Blakes, the decision to act for Enron on the terms proposed by me was obvious.* * * * * * * * *Mark, I have no clue why Blakes came to the decision it did in the circumstances.   Perhaps Blakes Toronto partner serviced clients are preferred?   Perhaps Blakes Calgary partners do not, or do not have the ability to represent the legitimate concerns of Enron within Blakes Toronto? Perhaps the Enron relationship is not adequately valued or Blakes does not like Enron's style?   Perhaps Blakes misjudged Enron's reaction relative to what would have been Westcoast's reaction in the alternative?   Whatever, the decision and the approach was wholly unsatisfactory.   Blakes needs to be accountable, and after-the-fact explanations, justifications, confessions, etc. are easily given, do not measure up to prior actions, and are necessarily self-serving. It is also noteworthy that Blakes decision partly resulted in an adjournment of the injunction application to Feb. 18/01 and fundamentally destroyed our opportunity to win the injunction which has since been dropped at considerable out-of-pocket cost and business prejudice to Enron.   It is also noteworthy that Westcoast soon after sold out its position in NGX to OM Gruppen, and that we have dropped both NGX and OM Gruppen from the lawsuit.Mark, I have told Blakes that in these circumstances, more than explanations, excuses and promises are necessary.   I also told them that we are focused on developing more external counsel relations, and since I have retained Oslers, Stikemans, and Ernst &amp; Young on various matters with good results.   I told Blakes that we certainly would not preclude using them, but that before I did so I wanted an explanation as to how these circumstances arose and how Blakes took the decision it did and communicated it the way it did.   I also told Blakes that the quality and staffing of their work had been slipping for some time, and that I would want a renewed commitment to staffing files with quality lawyers who are responsible for the working relationships.If you want to discuss the matter in advance of your meeting, please let me know.Peter.\n"

While I do not see this type of policy occurring in the U.S. I always think it is useful to keep an eye on developments like this, even if they exist outside the U.S., since many U.S regulators often look to the UK for \"ideas\" since it is further ahead in some respects on the deregulation curve.John*   U.K.:   REGULATOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO SUE   An offshoot of Dallas-based TXU, Edison Mission Energy and AES Corp. are three energy companies likely to be most affected by U.K. industry regulator Callum McCarthy's announcement yesterday that customers could be able to sue their suppliers for abusively raising prices.   The measure is designed to safeguard potential price manipulation by generators until new electricity wholesale trading rules are introduced next year. McCarthy plans to add \"good behavior\" clauses to legislation proposed by the government last week and scheduled for discussion in parliament next month. And an independent advisory body would settle disputes between McCarthy and electric companies.   Allegations from big industry customers that National Power and PowerGen abused their market power by raising prices in July spurred McCarthy's action. The company's combined profits were $21.7 million higher than profits during the same two weeks in 19998.   The companies \"strenuously deny\" the charges of price manipulation (Andrew Taylor, Financial Times, Oct. 19).\n"

These relate to thefollowing: Nominating Committee Results Citigroup Board Meeting Schedule Strategic Planning Meeting Schedule   Pre-Strategic Planning LunchesNominating Committee Results The Nominating Committee has completed its deliberations and has recommended111 individuals for election at this year's AGM to two-year terms. Inaddition to the reelection of Ernie, Jerry, Jose Manuel, Keith, Maurits,Terry, Tom and Tim, the Nominating Committee has proposed the followingindividuals for election:Kaushik Amin, Managing Director at Lehman Brothers NY, co-head of theirglobal fixed income division.Fred Janbon, Global Head of Fixed Income at BNP Paribas, LondonAzam Mistry, Director, Head of Risk Management Advisor---Treasury and CapitalMarkets, HSBC, Hong Kong, and Co-Chair of our Asia-Pacific SteeringCommitteeThank you to everyone on the nominating commitee for your efforts,particularly those of you who had an opportunity to meet these and otherprospective nominees. Citigroup The Nominating Committee chose not to nominate anyone from Citigroup forelection at this year's AGM. We have emphasized to Citigroup that thisdecision is due to a variety of factors, including lack of attendance atBoard meetings by current and past Board members and the fact that Citi hashad a seat on the Board continuously since the Association was formed. Wehave encouraged them to remain involved in ISDA activities with a view torejoining the Board at the earliest possible juncture. Please encourage yourCitigroup counterparts to get involved or remain involved in theAssociation's activities. Both Ravit and Thierry Sciard, who contacted us to offer himself as analternative for the position, were upset by the decision, but it is notclear what the long-term effects will be. The most immediate tangible effectis that Citi has indicated that it is withdrawing its co-sponsorship of theTuesday and Wednesday evening events at the Washington AGM. There is apossibility that Lehman may be interested in sponsorship. Board Meeting Schedule Please make note of the Board meeting schedule for the remainder of theyear:April 4 and 5 (over lunch each day at the AGM in Washington)May 16-17 in Kyoto (more details below)September 12 in LondonNovember 13 in New York (note this is a change from prior schedulesdistributed)Strategic Planning Session May 16 and 17 are the dates of our strategic planning session, which thisyear will be at the Miyako Hotel in Kyoto. The details on the Miyako Hotelare:MIYAKO HOTELSanjo KeageKyoto 605-00052JapanPhone: 81 75 7771 7111Fax: 81 75 751 2490http:/www.miyakohotel.co.jpThe schedule is slightly different from past sessions. I will provide moredetails on the specifics, but for your planning purposes, you should arrangeto be in Kyoto for lunch on Wednesday, May 16. (Bullet trains from Tokyothat morning will get you there in time.) We will have dinner in the hotelWednesday evening after our afternoon session. On Thursday, May 17, we willstart with breakfast and have a working lunch, with the session endingaround 2:000. The afternoon will be spent visiting temples and perhaps goingon a sake tasting tour. (Fortunately, I do not believe that Francis FordCoppola is a sake producer.) Dinner that evening will be at a restaurant andwill be accompanied by a Geisha dance. Please plan to stay for all of theevents. There is nothing planned for Friday so that everyone (particularlythe Europeans) can get planes out of Osaka or Tokyo on Friday morning thatwill get them back for the weekend. Pre-Strategic Planning Luncheons As in the past we will hold a series of luncheons in London, New York andTokyo where we will invite senior executives from member firms to share withus their thoughts on issues affecting the industry. The tentative scheduleand locations for these lunches is as follows:Wednesday, May 2   London   UBS (hosted by Tim Frederickson)Friday, May 111   New York   AIG (hosted by Ernie Patrikis)Tuesday, May 15   Tokyo   Royal Park Hotel (hosted byKoshikawa-san)In addition to attending the luncheon closest to your office, pleaseconsider arriving in Tokyo a day early to join us at the Tokyo session.Again, more details will follow. In the meantime, I would welcome anysuggestions for individuals we should invite to these luncheons in thevarious centers. I know this is a long email, but it covers the critical dates for the comingmonths in one fell swoop. I am on holiday the week of Feb. 19 and will be inAsia (visiting Beijing, Hong Kong and Tokyo) the week of Feb. 26. I will bechecking emails and voice mails. Bob Bob\n"

The summary has been prepared by Andy Cornfield who is our resident expert on the SFA's capital rules.As previously discussed, EEFT - our SFA regulated agent through which we currently propose to run this business - is subject only to very modest regulatory capital rules since it does not take any principal positions.   Our view, however, is that a bond and equity trading desk of the type discussed will (sooner or later) become subject to SFA capital requirements and so it makes sense now to estimate the likely extent of that capital.It would be very helpful at this stage if you (or someone in your group) could provide a guestimate (based on the US model, but modified where you think the European positions might be different) of the likely volumes and constituent parts of these businesses:after 12 months of trading after 24 months of tradingafter 36 months of tradingPlease contact Andy or myself if you would like to discuss this.

Today the ISO couldn't get supply from the market and informed market participants that CDWR would sleeve deals to the ISO. This occurred at a time when CA was in Stage 3 emergency (only the second one ever) and anticipating rolling blackouts this evening. Enron and other suppliers began to aggregate supply to sell to CDWR presumably to go to the ISO.   Belden was concerned that Gray Davis may just withhold payment through CDWR when settlements are due. This concern prompted us to require paper confirms for hourly deals and a discussion between Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (Stoel Rives) with the assistant director at CDWR to make sure CDWR management was on board - which they confirmed verbally. Regardless of all of this we still have some paranoia about getting paid. Is Gray Davis willing to confirm that no payment issue through CDWR will occur? We are currently continuing to aggregate supply through the day but are hesitant to increase quantities without such assurance. Other suppliers appeared hesitant as well as they wouldn't sleeve the deals to CDWR.\n"

Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. (\"EES Canada\"))) and Enron Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership (\"Enron Direct Canada\"))), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows:Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada.   This will involve:a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.;b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada Corp. to EES Canada; andc.   a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to Enron Direct Canada.By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada, both entities will continue to operate as they do today.As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and (ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is currently.B.   Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related \"permanent establishment\" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp. would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.   Accordingly, Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups. Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian subsidiaries.   In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me; however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume the role. With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron Direct Canada.   With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the interim.Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals.Regards,Mark Powell\n"

Peggy explained thatafter long negotiation, ENE had been able to convince Vitro and CementosApasco (and other power purchasers/construction companies?) to agree thattheir contracts be governed by New York law but that despite this greatsuccess, IADB now for policy reasons was insisting that those contracts begoverned by Mexican law.Peggy and I talked with Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and Peggy subsequentlyprovided me copies of three memoranda dated August 15, September 18 andSeptember 27, 2000, addressed to Peggy and Robert Stephens of Bracewell &amp;Patterson from Rogelio Lopez-Velarde and Amanada Valdez.   In the August 15,2000, memorandum Rogelio and Ms. Valdez analyzed the enforceability ofcertain of the provisions of the PPA between Enron Energia Industrial deMexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Apasco should that agreement be governed byMexican law.   They recommended certain changes be made if the agreement wereto be governed by Mexican law.   In the September 18, 2000, memorandumRogelio and Ms. Valdez gave their opinion on the enforceability of the\"Suspension Remedy\" contained in Section 13.5 of the PPA.   In theirmemorandum of September 27, 2000, they opined principally that the provisionof Section 13.6 of the PPA specifically denying each \"Capacity User\" theright to terminate the PPA except in the case of a \"Producer Event ofDefault under Section 132(a) (sic) has occurred and the Project has beenAbandoned\" was unenforceable.   I have reviewed the three memoranda but Ihave not reviewed the PPA nor any of the other underlying Project documents.As Joe Dilg mentioned to you before we undertook last week our limitedreview of the Enron-Vitro Amparo matter, we are not Mexican lawyers andtherefore we cannot opine on the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogados memorandaand opinions referenced above and we cannot opine on how the application ofMexican law to disputes that could arise under agreements the IADB nowinsists be governed by Mexican law might affect the enforceability ofprovisions of those agreements or the agreements themselves.   I consider the memoranda provided by the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogadosfirm, however, to be well reasoned and written.   As I have not seen theunderlying documents, I am not able to determine whether the August 15,2000, memorandum addresses all of what the drafters characterize as the\"Challengeable Clauses\" in the PPA in Section I.2.A.   My guess is that theform from which the PPA has been developed is a form that ENE has used onother occasions in circumstances that would permit the agreements to begoverned by laws of jurisdictions that have experience consideringsophisticated commercial disputes at a minimum and perhaps disputesspecifically arising under power purchase agreements.   If ENE does agree tosubject interpretation of the PPA and other affected contracts to Mexicanlaw, it would be worthwhile to again review the PPA and other affectedagreements to be absolutely sure that all of the \"Challengable Clauses\" areidentified and either changed in a manner acceptable to ENE to make themenforceable or if not changed that the risks of leaving the provisions \"asis\"   are fully understood and evaluated by ENE.   I do have the followingspecific comments concerning the August 15, 2000, memorandum:   1.   If they already have not been made, is it possible still toconvince the Mexican counter parties to make the changes Lopez Velarde,Hefty, Abogados have suggested?   Based on the Lopez Velarde, Hefty, Abogadosmemos, it seems to me that   ENE, as a condition to agreeing to acceptMexican law as the governing law, would want to negotiate at least thematerial changes to the PPA suggested by the Lopez Velarde, Heftye, Abogadosfirm in the memoranda.   2.   If it is not possible to negotiate the changes or ispossible only to negotiate some of the changes, with respect to the\"Discretionary Performance Prohibition\" and the \"Discretionary ConditionProhibition\" outlined in Sections I.1.1 A. and B, would only thespecifically applicable Performance or Condition provision be renderedunenforceable or could the PPA in its entirety be deemed unenforceable ifeither \"performance of portions of the PPA [as opposed to performance of theentire agreement] are left to the unilateral discretion of one of theparties.\" or \"compliance with some [as opposed to all] [of the conditions]rests exclusively in the discretion of the obligor...\"?   Are there any Performance or Condition Prohibitions thatindividually could be deemed to render unenforceable the entire PPA?   If there are a number of Performance or ConditionProhibitions that are not amended, could they in the aggregate be deemedsufficient to render undenforecable the entire PPA?   3.   Is there any other Challengable Clause or other clause inthe PPA or other affected agreement that without modification to makeenforceable should cause ENE not to entier into the PPA or other affectedagreement ?   4.   Do the Discretionary Performance or Discretionary ConditionProhibitions constitute events of default, even if the party in whose favorthey run do not attempt to enforce them, constitute an event of default thatwould afford the \"innocent party\"   the right to demand rescission of thePPA?I understand that the PPA and the affected contracts all contain disputeresolution provisions that would subject disputes to internationalarbitration.   Assuming that the dispute resolution provisions are notrenegotiated, the fact that Mexican law, if agreed as the governing law,will be interpreted by arbitrators and not Mexican courts is a factor thatcould result in a more independent consideration and resolution of theinterpretation and application of Mexican law to disputes that may ariseunder the contracts.

Panther is one of the operating subsidiaries in our DPR Holding Company relationship with Chris Cline.As many of you are aware, we are in the process of restructuring the Panther loan. Panther has violated certain financial covenants as a result of the lack of coal production when the mine was temporarily idled. These covenant violations put the loan in default and put us in a position to restructure certain aspects of the relationship. (All principal and interest payments have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown).Part of the restructuring may involve deferring certain principal payments until 6/30/000 when Panther is expected to resume coal production. Since we are in the process of negotiating certain changes and since DPR Holding Company was sitting on $2.0 mm to be used for the payment and/or dividend distributions, they asked if they could wait until the distribution payment date in November before making the principal payment. This would give us a few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable them to defer the payment until June. This would also allow DPR to make a larger dividend distribution to both us and Cline. I told them that this was okay but that it did not constitute a waiver or decision to defer the payment. Unfortunately, this was not communicated well internally. I felt that this was an acceptable action because the company has the money and we are in the process of restructuring the repayment schedule. I also viewed it as a minor accomodation to Cline who has personally spent over $5 million on equipment for the project since January and has not charged the joint venture. However, to avoid hurting the relationship or DPR's reputation internally, Cline made the payment today.\n"

The attached documents, including the agenda, a memo on the Bridgeagreement, and a copy of the Bridge agreement, were reviewed at thismorning's meeting. Much of the discussion focused on explanation of the Bridge Agreement. Therewas some discussion about the German regulatory structure and the bridgeagreement.   Katia ran through the agenda in Houston and asked for ideas onDecember conference.   I was not able to hear all of the questions entirelybut questions were asked about the outcome of the meeting.   Katia andChristophe explained that it was a forum to exchange ideas and to promoteuse of ISDA within industry. The minutes should give us more detail.   In addition to a call re: the NA agenda, I think it would be worthwhile toalso have a call w/Christophe, Katia and John Berry to discuss Europeanactivities and to begin discussion on the December agenda. ISDA should beginto focus on an agenda as soon as possible so that we assure December'sconference is as productive as the Houston conference.

Simultaneously,   we will launch an external web site focused on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit models and research papers on effective credit risk management.   Utilising e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for corporate credit protection.   We expect to make a public announcement about these new products in late January.In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as well.

Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on   the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,5000 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.   The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.   Checking further we discovered that   the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from Kelley, who wanted to be operator.   Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron (not Kelley)   to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.   Kelley was upset about this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call provisons were deleted.   Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and collect from Kelley.Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay their share of well costs before costs are incurred.   This can be particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost overruns that partners don't   want to pay.   In this case, our surrogate operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be prepaid by Enron 1000%.   The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed   that we are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation (and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.Lessons Learned:   1) The E&amp;P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S. Louisiana exploratory test.   2)   Important provisions, like \"cash call\" should never be given away without appropriate risk assessment and approval.Please call if you have questions. \n"

Rob, Jordan and I have been considering this from a legal relationships perspective and request your thoughts on same.   Tobias Munk of DealBench has been working on developing this DealBench/Freshfields relationship for a couple of months.   Tobias came to DealBench from Enron London to help develop a capability to do due diligence on the DealBench platform (the dataroom product).   He initiated contact with Freshfields (Hugh Crisp) before moving to Houston.   DealBench has been aware that this relationship would be subject to approval by Enron legal management.The proposed relationship essentially is a business referral one:   DealBench would pay Freshfields 10% of site license fees paid to DealBench by customers referred by Freshfields.   Freshfields also would provide up to 1000 hours of consulting services regarding the dataroom product for no additional monetary consideration but DealBench would give Freshfields exclusive recognition for helping DealBench develop the dataroom product in Europe and Asia. DealBench advises that Freshfields believes it would benefit from the publicity associated with being part of the development of an e-commerce product.   The DealBench commercial team is very interested in moving forward with Freshfields.   Although Freshfields cannot guarantee any referrals, DealBench believes the relationship would be fruitful for it commercially because of Freshfields' prominence in M&amp;A transactions in Europe and Asia. Before DealBench moves further with Freshfields, it would like legal clearance.   We look forward to hearing from you.Regards, NJDNora J.

Mark Frevert and Dan Leff will join Brian Stanley, John Gillis, and the two of us for this discussion.   Led by Mark and Dan, we have been on a corporate journey to determine the best method to provide a resource base for the building , operating, and maintaining of our existing and planned major assets. The discussions evolved around two major issues. First,   most of the engineering and project management resources were concentrated in the former EE &amp;CC, but operational resources were spread among several groups.   OEC provided operational support to some, but not all Enron assets.   Second, the clear need for both the engineering and operational resources was in Wholesale not Retail (EES).   There will be some need to help EES bridge into Industrial clients, but this need is minor compared to the requirements of Wholesale.   As a benefit of the time Mark and Dan plus other Executive Committee Members put into the decision   to form EEOS, we believe we are correctly positioned to effectively address Enron's major project needs.   Our Thursday meeting is an open forum to discuss these and other issues you might have with our new or perhaps more clearly defined position.   We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.Keith Dodson Chief Operating Officer - EEOSKen BeanVice President - Operational Energy Corp.\n"

We hope to have agreed on the Q&amp;A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday.JohnTo be sent to:   All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,   all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the companyEnron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals,   Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),   Coal,   LNG &amp; Weather.   Though Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure.   Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses.   Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market.   Based on these changes Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,   Oil,   LNG,   Coal, and Shipping.   We expect to continue our general recruiting   of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,   Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan.   The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.   Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron.   The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year.The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan.   We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London.By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business.   These employees remain in   Enron Credit , a part of Enron Europe.EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand   by year end.The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months.In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.   Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report   to Mark Evans, General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London.   The   IT, HR,   Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. Nick O'Day who heads both the Public Affairs group (Government &amp; Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Genle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shappiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but he will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS &amp; Industrial Markets.We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will be a major profit center for profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.\n"

The overall legal budget was $4,835,184 over budget as of August 31, primarily due to Outside Costs which went over the planned amount by $5,094,838.   The most significant outside costs were incurred in litigation, power plant development, legally intensive deals such as United Illuminating, and misallocated costs for Projects Summer and California.   The Inside Costs were under budget in the amount of $259,654.If you have any questions, please call me at extension 354448.Deb KorkmasEnron North America Corp.ENA Legal Dept.14000 Smith Street, Room 3819Houston, TX   7770002Phone:   713-853-54448Fax:   713-646-33393\n"

These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.   ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.   However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.   Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and ENA.3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.   Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.   Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of the Chairman for final approval.Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.Thank you for your cooperation.\n"

To facilitate the wider use of electronic contracts, this protocol could be endorsed by ISDA. Hopefully, it would become a standard that others would use for all types of contracts. Perhaps, if necessary or helpful, the adoption of the protocol could be done electronically by each party unilaterally agreeing to abide by it, possibly using the same type of approach ISDA used in connection with the introduction of the EMU currency a few years ago.   Initially, the protocol would be primarily applicable to U.S. counterparties, but it could be expanded to non-U.S. counterparties as e-signature laws like the new U.S. law are enacted across the globe.Basic Protocol:   By adopting the protocol, each counterparty would agree that the relevant agreement may be electronically signed by complying with the following steps:1) The parties negotiate and agree on a final form the relevant agreement, and appoint one of the parties (\"First Party\") to prepare the document for electronic signature;2) The First Party prepares the final form in the PDF format (e.g., the body of the text could not be modified) with the exception of the blank signature blocks for each party to be placed on the last page of the agreement;3) An authorized signatory of the First Party electronically signs the agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by inscribing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in his/her name and title in the blank signature block);4) The agreement, as electronically signed by the First Party, is sent via electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the First Party to the other party (\"Second Party\");5) An authorized signatory of the Second Party   electronically signs the agreement (Note: this electronic signature could be accomplished by impressing an electronic handwritten signature or the signatory typing in his/her name and title in the signature block);6) The agreement, as electronically signed by the Second Party, is sent via electronic means (e.g., by e-mail) by the Second Party to the First Party, accordingly, creating the fully executed agreement; and7) Each party would be responsible for maintaining in its own electronic archives the agreement as electronically signed by the parties.Also, the following could be considered: (a) adding to the protocol that each party,by adopting the protocol, agrees to be bound by any agreement entered into by means of the protocol, and any other appropriate language to enhance the enforceability of the \"e-signature\" process and (b) adding to the preprinted form of the Master Agreement, a provision whereby each party adopts the electronic signature protocol endorsed by ISDA as in effect from time to time.Mark, I would be happy to discuss this draft proposal with you further at your convenience.Regards, Alan\n"

I know that many of you have been advocating this for awhileso I am happy to say that the day will soon be here. In anticipation ofthat, I would appreciate your input on how the documentation is madeavailable and, in particular, the pricing of that access. For anyone other than an ISDA member, the documents will be made availablein electronic PDF form for purchase on a per document basis. For members,two additional options will be made available for access to interactiveversions of the documentation: an internet version and an intranet version. The internet version will consist of the complete library of ISDAdocumentation in an interactive version also in PDF format. The documentswill include internal links within documents (section reference to thesection itself, use of a defined term to its definition) as well as links toUser's Guides that have been published for a particular document. We proposethat the pricing of this option will be on a per user annual fee basis. The intranet option will permit users to take the full library of ISDAdocuments and place it on a firm's intranet, thereby providing access toanyone within the firm who has access to the intranet. ISDA would charge afixed annual fee for this service.   I would appreciate your responses to the following questions: 1. Ignoring cost, do you think your institution would be more likely to usethe internet version of the documents or take them onto your intranet?   2. If you are more likely to use the internet version, how many users wouldyou anticipate worldwide within your institution? 3. For the internet service, would you prefer to pay (a) a high initial feefor the first user (e.g., $5,000) and a small additional fee for eachincremental user (e.g., $1000) or (b) a lower initial fee (e.g., $3,000) anda larger additional fee for each incremental user (e.g., $5000)? Assume forthese purposes that the cost of the intranet service is $10,000 per annum. 4. Would your answer to question 3 change if the cost of the intranetservice were $15,000? I will not hold you to any of these answers. I just hope to get your inputas we proceed to further consideration at the Board level of how electronicdelivery of documentation will work and how it will be priced. Thank you for your input. Bob Pickel \n"

Parental GuaranteesLavo/Mark, although it has been a chronic problem, the seemingly inexcusable delay at processing guarantees by Enron Corp. (both Enron Corp. and Counterparty) seems to be getting worse of late.   It is becoming an impediment to transacting and to our reputation in the market as the largest and most responsive energy marketer.   As you know, our business is essentially transacted off Enron Corp.'s credit, and procuring guarantees is often unnecessarily difficult and time consuming.   I know that Commercial, Credit and Legal are all frustrated by the process.   I know Bill is seeing if there is something he can do, but I was wondering whether there was also something you could do to speak to this issue in Houston.Peter.\n"

We've been bogged down over here with commercial disputes, so I have not been able to keep up with your current organization. If Dan Bruce is still involved in assisting you, he would be great, or maybe there is someone else who can help. In our current dispute with the gov't, we are concerned about possibilities of raids by gov't to seize documents, files, etc. We are in the process of removing hard files from India, taking them to our attorneys' offices in London. However, I am very concerned about electronic files and e-mails and such related stuff that could also be seized. This is true of servers, desktops, laptops and other computer devices.Who can I speak to to get some guidance about how we can very quickly remove these items from our systems and hardware here in India? My immediate concern is getting this stuff out of the country as soon as we can. Once out, I can worry about indexing and making available specific items upon request to people in India when they need it.Thanks for your input.Wade\n"

We exchanged 2 drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 999% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 20001.   Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would be extinguished.   However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.   The way the deal w/ Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close (est to be $3000K+/-).   Fidelity wants 2 things:protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits accrued (i.e., the $3000K), andprotection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they were a partner in LGI (June, 2000 thru Jan, 20001).There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a specific cap on the tax credit amount ($3000K+/-) and with the same environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to issues which occurred while they were a partner.   The probability of either ever being triggered is extremely remote.   Replacing the benefactor from LGI to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.   Per ENA accounting since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance sheet item.The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty \"in hand\" and unless you give me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any leverage to get them to release it.   They are willing to work with us on either of the 2 alternatives listed above.   This is the only remaining commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.Please advise or call to discuss further.   Ext. 333212.   Thanks!RANDY\n"

Vicki, you also need to be aware of this as well.I attach a letter EECC signed and sent out to the EcoElectrica project yesterday re the need to schedule a senior management meeting to try and resolve outstanding issues and payments due EECC for this project, We have been trying to schedule meetings to resolve these matters since September, but the project, perhaps because of Mission Energy's impact, has not yet agreed to a meeting to resolve the matter.   With David Haug's help   we were able to get a significant portion of undisputed payments that had been delinquent for some time (in some cases since before the first of the year) paid. including a recent payment of $6 million. Even so, approximately $18 million still remains unpaid to EECC and seriously delinquent.   EcoElectrica has identified $8.4 million as being withheld in connection with disputed liquidated damage payments, but there remains an undisputed, unpaid balance of approximately $9.6 million that EcoElectrica has not offered any contractual or other explanation for withholding other than that   they are working on other matters.Larry Izzo needs to get these claims resolved, and at least needs a commitment from EcoElectrica to a date for formal senior management discussions under the contract from the project. Failing that, he will be directing EECC to seek clearance to institute arbitration proceedings.\n"

Most if not all of you are using the Client software on your PC's.   In order to provide more security to both Enron and Your PC.   We need to configure and deploy a Nortel Instant Internet Box.   the way the Nortel box works is what they call splitt tunnelling.   If it sees traffic that needs to go to enron it will go through the tunnel, other wise it goes directly to the internet.We will need to know the following information to configure and deploy the Router1.

Thomas Ewing, R-Ill.,chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Risk Management, fordiminishing the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission overcertain derivatives products.The legislation, as well as a companion bill introduced by SenateAgriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind., would streamline the lawsoverseeing derivatives products and futures markets as well as deregulatesome aspects of that industry.Lawmakers have been struggling all year to revamp those markets. TheCommodity Exchange Act - which expires Sept. 30 - determines which agency,the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has jurisdiction overwhat derivatives products.A tugging war between the two agencies over how to redraw those lines hasslowed progress on the legislation.Annette Nazareth, director of the SEC's division of market regulation,faulted Ewing's legislation for creating a new kind of deregulated futurestrading facility, but then giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over thesecurities traded on those new facilities.\"The (SEC) does not believe that there is a justification for eliminatingthe traditional role of other regulators, including the SEC, in regulatingmarkets and intermediaries that trade such government securities and otherproducts,\" Nazareth said in written testimony.She noted that it's especially important that the SEC retain its authority\"when these products would be traded on facilities subject to even fewerinvestor protections than exist today on futures exchanges.\"Treasury assistant secretary Lewis Sachs also found that section of the billflawed, saying that his agency was concerned that Ewing's bill makesregulatory oversight of clearinghouses optional, not mandatory. He wassimilarly concerned about giving the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over alltransactions conducted within a clearinghouse.\"The exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC may preclude securities regulatorsfrom maintaining oversight of organizations that clear securities-relatedproducts,\" Sachs said in his written testimony. He added that regulation ofclearinghouses should be mandatory and that the SEC should overseeclearinghouse transactions for products currently under its jurisdiction.Nazareth also suggested that Ewing clarify a section of the bill so that itclearly gives the SEC direct access to audit trails, coordinated marketsurveillance and inspection authority to pursue insider trading and otherfraudulent practices regarding the trading of single-stock futures.\"The SEC should not be required to seek the permission of any other entityto protect investors,\" she said.Both Sachs and Nazareth found it \"troublesome\" that Ewing's bill has a lowerthreshold than other proposals for determining what constitutes a\"sophisticated investor.\" That's important because the legislation allowssophisticated investors to conduct a wide variety of transactions with theleast amount of scrutiny from federal regulators.\"We do not believe that adequate consideration has been given to whether $10million in total assets is a sufficient indication of sophistication,\" shesaid. \"Moreover, the bill grants the CFTC broad discretion to declare anyonean eligible contract participant.\"Lugar's bill, as well as a report released last year by the nation's topfinancial regulators, defines a sophisticated investors as having at least$25 million in assets.Sachs also had serious reservations about the way Ewing's bill relievesregulatory burdens for futures markets, saying that there may be someunintended consequences for \"legislating\" relief.\"Once such provisions are written into law, the regulators will have noability to review and amend them should subsequent market developmentswarrant change or should other problems arise,\" Sachs said.In addition, Sachs was troubled by some changes to the rules overseeinggovernment securities that, he said, could \"undermine the laws that Congressput in place in recent years that were designed to uphold and strengthen theintegrity of the government securities market.\"Patrick Parkinson, associate director of the division of research andstatistics for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, alsocriticized a section of the bill that he said would \"leave uncertainty aboutwhether some electronic trading systems for financial contracts betweenprofessional counterparties were subject to the (Commodities Exchange Act).\"C. Robert Paul, general counsel for the CFTC, had concerns of his own aboutthe legislation. He highlighted problems with the way the bill handles metaland energy commodities as they relate to electronic trading systems.For his part, Ewing warned regulators that Congress may run out of time topass the legislation this year if the agencies can't agree on key aspects ofthe bill.\"I hesitate to say, let's pass those parts we agree on. It's pretty easy topat yourself on the back and just do the easy work,\" Ewing said.Several lawmakers criticized the SEC and CFTC for holding up progress forthe sake of politics. The two agencies have deep differences of opinion overhow to regulate single-stock futures.Ewing's bill gives the CFTC almost exclusive authority over single-stockfutures. The SEC wants to share jurisdiction over the new product.\"I really don't necessarily see this as a turf battle,\" Nazareth saidfollowing her testimony. \"There are significant challenges in crafting aframework that protects investors in the way they have come to expect in thesecurities market.\"Dow Jones Energy Service, 6/15/000Japan Online Power Trading May Spark More DeregulationBy Mika WatanabeTOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Partial deregulation of Japan's power industry in Marchhasn't exactly charged up the country's power sector, as industrial andcommercial users have yet to take advantage of their newly-won freedom topick suppliers.However, the launch of online electricity trading in Japan later this yearwill likely lure more independent power suppliers into the market, spurringtrading activity and possibly prompting the government to take furtherderegulation steps ahead of a scheduled review in March 20003, analysts say.Among the early birds hoping to provide the catalyst for this process in theform of a trading system are Japanese trading house Itochu Corp. (J.CIT or80001) and the U.S.' Automated Power Exchange (X.AUP), which plan to launch aWeb-based electric power exchange in November.U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) has also launched its global EnronOnlineInternet trading platform for a variety of commodities and financialproducts and is approaching companies here with the eventual target oftrading electricity.\"Even though the market will be limited initially, if the trading mechanismwere there, a substantial number of large-lot buyers who seek lower priceswould participate, while potential sellers who hold excess generationcapacity would also join in, to make money from their idle assets,\" saidNaoto Hashimoto, a senior utility analyst at Nomura Securities.As of March, Japan's 8,000-odd high-volume industrial and commercial users -which together represent 27% of total Japanese power demand - are now freeto choose their suppliers.\"The potential is enormous,\" agreed Hideki Yokoyama, general manager ofItochu's power project group. \"Though the performance (of our onlineexchange) won't necessarily be stellar at first, its early launch shouldpave a smooth way to grab some 65% of the Japanese electricity market, whichis slated to open in the next stage of deregulation within three years.\"Yokoyama also noted a chicken-and-egg effect: while trading activity wouldlikely lead to faster deregulation, specific liberalization measures wouldlead to more activity. Online electricity trading might take hold in Japansooner than expected if requirements discouraging potential entrants areeased in response to growing complaints from various industries, he said.Even after partial deregulation, independent power producers who want tosell retail electricity are still fettered by several inflexiblerequirements. For example, companies must sign a one-year or longertransmission grid leasing contract and a costly back-up supply contract withexisting utilities.Yokoyama predicts that the Ministry of International Trade and Industrymight relax such requirements before the 20003 review.\"Potential entrants' calls for online trading could set a wave of e-commercein motion, and that would put added pressure on the regulators,\" he said.Utilities' Participation Key To Boosting LiquidityExperts concede that online electricity trading liquidity is likely to bethin in the initial stage, but they say volume will snowball as domesticutility giants enter the market.APX and Itochu plan to form a joint venture in July for their onlineexchange, tentatively called JPX, and expect Japanese utilities as well asother energy concerns to invest in the Y1.5-billion venture.\"We will keep the door open for any regional power monopolies,\" saidYokoyama, adding that some utilities are now studying the trading mechanismwith keen interest.\"It's just a matter of time before some farsighted existing utilities usethe new mechanism to hedge against potential risks such as losing customersand falling prices, and this will consequently increase market liquidity,\"predicted Nomura's Hashimoto.Outside the power concerns, the likely participation of other domesticheavyweights, including Osaka Gas Co. (J.OSG or 9532) and Nippon Telegraph &amp;Telephone Corp. (NTT or 9432) should also provide a tremendous boost to theelectricity market, said Masanori Maruo, a Tokyo-based utility analyst atDeutsche Securities Ltd.NTT, Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas Co. (J.TYG or 9531) already unveiled in Marchtheir plan to team up in entering Japan's retail electricity business.\"Gas utilities and NTT hold massive excess power generation capacity, whileNTT is the country's largest electricity user which alone represents 0.5% ofentire domestic consumption,\" said Maruo. \"The combination will be able toplay a significant role in electricity trading by taking a two-way positionto offset risks,\" he said.In addition, some domestic and foreign financial firms, including IndustrialBank of Japan Ltd. (J.IBJ or 8302) and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.(MWD), are set to offer various electricity-linked derivatives, designed tomanage risks from fluctuations in demand and prices. Such products couldspur further market participation of existing utilities as well as potentialsellers.Analysts say the biggest long-term risks are those faced by utilities whichlag behind in doing business the new way. While market participation won'tbring them much financial gain, such power companies have the mostcompelling need to hedge against price fluctuations, as they surrender theirprice-setting monopolies to market forces.\"It may seem that power utilities have little to gain from participating inonline trading, but in fact, they have much to lose if they stay away fromthe trading mechanism,\" as they fall behind in hedging risks, saidHashimoto. \"Eventually, they'd end up playing a loser's game.\"The Wall Street Journal Europe, 6/14/000Philippines Relaxes Banks' Requirement To Raise CapitalMANILA --- The Philippine Central Bank has decided to withdraw a requirementfor banks to raise their minimum capital for 2000, a move expected to easeinvestors' concerns over the stability of the country's banking industry,analysts said.The decision to eliminate the third and final round of a capital increasefor banks effectively extends to Dec. 31, 2000, the deadline for compliancewith last year's minimum capital requirement of 4.95 billion pesos (1222.2million euros) for universal banks and 2.4 billion pesos for commercialbanks.Originally, universal banks were required to raise their minimum capital to5.3 billion pesos by the end of 2000, while commercial banks were requiredto raise their minimum capital to 2.8 billion pesos.In the Philippines, universal banks are commercial banks with expandedlicenses that allow them to venture into noncommercial banking operationssuch as investment banking and fund management.The central bank's decision to relax its capital rule will prevent a loss ofconfidence in banks that would otherwise have had a difficult time meetingthe new requirement, said Angping &amp; Associates Securities Inc. The move willalso prevent panic among depositors that could lead to heavy withdrawals atbanks or the banks' closure, Angping added.The central bank's capital requirement for banks may be adjusted next yearin line with the new risk-based capital framework contained in the recentlypassed General Banking Act.The framework allows the central bank to impose new capital requirementsbased on the activities banks are involved in and the capital risks tied tothem. Higher capitalization may be imposed, for instance, on banks engagedin high-risk transactions such as derivatives trading, central bank Gov.Rafael Buenaventura said.The central bank implemented a three-stage increase of the minimum capitalof banks in 19998 in a bid to strengthen the banking system to prevent afallout from the Asian financial crisis. Ironically, however, the highercapital requirements indirectly led to the closure of one commercial bankand heavy withdrawals at two other banks earlier this year. Last month,Urban Bank closed after experiencing a liquidity crunch after several daysof withdrawals by depositors.The withdrawals were triggered by rumors that the bank's previous downgradeto a thrift bank from a commercial bank was because of cash flow problems.The bank was downgraded because it couldn't meet the original 2.4 billionpeso capital requirement deadline for commercial banks as of the end of1999.The Economist, 6/10/000Danger SignsAn unusual thing happened this week in America. The prices of corporatebonds rose. Of late they have proved a dreadful investment-worse by far thangovernment bonds. How much farther their prices will rise depends largely onwhat happens in the market in which they are priced: the swaps market. Thatmarket is in turmoil.Swaps are the glue that binds together the world's financial system. Firstdeveloped in the early 1980s, they now dwarf other financial instruments. Atthe end of last year there were some $46 trillion of swaps outstanding,compared with $5.4 trillion in, for example, international bond markets.Broadly, swaps come in two forms: interest-rate swaps and currency swaps.Simply put, both allow parties to exchange cash-flows. In a currency swap,the two exchange currencies and re-exchange them at maturity at the samerate. In the meantime they exchange interest payments.   In a typicalinterest-rate swap, one side exchanges a floating-rate obligation (generallybased on Libor, the rate at which the best banks lend to each other) for afixed one.This simplicity has made swaps, and interest-rate swaps in particular, avery useful tool.   They allow banks, for example, to match their assets andliabilities much more closely. If they have lots of short-term floating-rateliabilities (such as savings accounts) but long-term fixed-rate assets (suchas loans) they can \"swap\" long-term assets into short-term ones. Likewise,companies can use swaps to convert fixed-rate debt (which investors mightprefer) into floating-rate debt, or vice versa.The level of the fixed rate in the swap reflects, among other things, thewillingness of the market to accept corporate debt rather than governmentdebt, which means that the swap rate is calculated at a spread overgovernment bonds. Euro swap-spreads have risen in recent weeks, but dollarswap-spreads have widened dramatically. Ten-year spreads peaked at the endof May at 140 basis points (hundredths of a percentage point)-a higherspread than ever before (see chart on next page). They have since narrowed,but are still wider than at the height of the financial crisis that followedRussia's default. At times in recent weeks, the swaps market has shut downcompletely; nobody was willing to receive a fixed rate.What on earth is going on? There are, broadly, two sets of explanations, onerelatively benign, the other emphatically not. The benign view is that therise in swap spreads is explicable by rising interest rates, greater defaultrisk, and the relative sizes of government-and corporate-bond markets.Governments are issuing fewer bonds. On optimistic assumptions, America'sgovernment could buy back all its debt by 2010. American companies, incontrast, are borrowing hugely. That makes government bonds more valuable,compared with corporate debt. It reflects what Stephen Compton, head ofbonds at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in Europe, calls \"the privatisationof the bond markets\".Rising interest rates, too, are partly to blame for widening swap spreads.When the market thinks that interest rates will rise, there is more of anincentive to pay, rather than receive, a fixed rate. That incentive isgreater at times when, as now, long-term rates are lower than short-termones (an \"inverted yield curve\"). This means that anybody receiving a fixed(long-term) rate and paying a floating one loses money.Then there is the increase in corporate debt Credit Suisse First Boston(CSFB) expects American companies to issue as many bonds this year as theydid last, when they sold record amounts. Importantly for swap spreads, onereason that firms are borrowing so much is to buy back their shares. SoAmerican companies are becoming ever more highly geared, and hence lesscreditworthy. Share buy-backs are running at double last year's level and,reckons David Goldman, a strategist at CSFB, will remain in vogue as long asdebt is relatively cheap, and firms' managers think that more leverage isgood for shareholder value.If this were not enough, swap-market folk also point accusing fingers atGary Gensler, under-secretary at the American Treasury. In March, he saidthat federally sponsored agencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whicheverybody assumed were guaranteed by the government, were not. The yield ontheir debt rose sharply. Since they are the biggest actors in the swapsmarket, so did swap spreads.Swap knotTaken together, these factors might seem enough to explain what hashappened. But James Bianco, who runs an eponymous research firm, thinks theyare not. Swap spreads, he points out, have been widening for the past threeand a half years-before any of these other factors cropped up. And they donot explain why swap spreads have risen so fast this year.Mr. Bianco argues that two things dominate the pricing of interest-rateswaps: interest rates and credit concerns. For most of the 19990S swap rateswent up and down with interest rates. That relationship has now largelybroken down, suggests Mr. Bianco, because markets have become more concernedover risks to the financial system, as a result of the crises of recentyears. If Mr. Bianco is right, this has important ramifications: it suggeststhere are growing worries about the riskiness of the swaps market, based onfears about the health of financial firms-by far the biggest participants.Pshaw, say critics: there is no credit risk in the swaps market. Forgetabout those telephone-number figures: no principal amount is exchanged in aswap, so what matters is not the \"notional\" amount at risk but the cost ofreplacing the swaps-a far lower number. Moreover, big banks post collateralif they are on the losing side of a swap, thus eliminating even any residualrisk.Really? \"Swaps are perceived as riskless. That must be wrong,\" says atreasurer at a big bank. Unlike futures exchanges, the swaps market looksonly at current exposures, not potential ones (futures exchanges demand adollop of cash up front to cover the second). And the market has grown somuch that these potential risks are becoming huge.So it is at least plausible that people are starting to fret about thebanking system. But why might this be a problem in America, of all places?Because it is taking ever more risk to generate the returns demanded byshare-holders. Bank lending is growing by 10% at an annual rate, andproperty lending by 13.5%, its highest rate since 1989. If anything, theserates are accelerating because, after nine years of growth and few defaults,banks' backward-looking risk models tell them that lending is a finebusiness.And not just in America. In Europe, too, banks are taking more risk togenerate higher returns. At best, the swap market is merely reflecting thisincrease in risk. At worst, it might be signaling that the world's financialsystem is in danger of becoming unglued.End of ISDA Press Report, Thursday, June 15, 2000.THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE LIMITED USE OF ISDA STAFF, ISDA'SBOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SPECIFIED CONSULTANTS TO ISDA.

I am an attorney with Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &amp; Feld, L.L.P. in Washington, D.C., and I was referred to you by Charles Moore.   Thank you for agreeing to help us arrange interviews with Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford.   To give you some background, we are representing Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. in a breach of contract dispute with Central Resources, Inc. regarding losses and costs resulting from Central's alleged default of its obligations under the terms of natural gas and crude oil swap and swaption transactions.   Statoil alleges that Central did not provide the credit assurances required once it exceeded its credit limit, so Statoil terminated the transactions.   During negotiations, however, prior to termination, Central and Statoil were negotiating with Enron regarding a possible assignment of the transactions to Enron.   This was not consummated, but we would be inquiring into the circumstances surrounding the proposed assignment.   We would like to interview Enron employees Fred Lagrasta and Bill Bradford regarding these discussions concerning the potential assignment, in o!rder to evaluate whether there is any need to depose either of these individuals.   Please let me know if you need anything further, and again, I appreciate your cooperation in arranging these interviews.   You can call me at 202-8887-4387, or e-mail me, to discuss arrangements.

Fiona, please pull together bios on each of Enron's team members and current job assignments at Enron and forward to Sid and John so they can know who they are dealing with - - - take a little of the mystery out of first engagements!   I will forward a hardcopy diagram of the Enron/MG plc Integration plan - - -John Gill.   John's role as Assistant to the Executive is a senior commercial position.   He was recruited + hired by MG from GE Capital and has extensive experience in M+A activities.   He is assigned to MG's merchanting division and is a relatively recent hire.   I believe he has been actively involved in recruiting a 9 person structured finance team.   John, along with Sid Tipples and David Tregar, has been tasked to co-ordinate the Enron/MG integration.Sid Tipples.   Like John Gill, Sid is an Assistant to the Executive working in the financial services division.   I've had limited conversation with him.   He is actively involved in corp development.Howard Carter.   Howard is the Director of Finance in MCC.   He started his career at Anglo Chemical and Ore Co transferring to Philipp Bros when it acquired the majority holding in Anglo Chemicals.   He qualified as an accountant in 1979 and became a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants in 1984.   He joined MCC (physical merchanting division) when it was established in 1989.   He talked to me about a \"control\" function that his group performs that sounds somewhat like a combination of Enron's tasks for originators and structurers.   He seems to pick up several functions in the merchanting division and Michael Farmer is keen to keep him in the loop for H/R assessments.David Tregar.   David is the Financial Director.   He was educated at Lancaster University prior to joining Arthur Andersen in 1973.   He became an associate of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in 1976 and   Fellow of the Institute in 1981.   Since leaving AA in 1978, he has worked continuously in commodity trading.   He joined MGAG in 19990 and was appointed Finance Director   of MGL in 19991.   Prior to this he worked for several US brokerage houses.   He is involved in just about everything at MG (risk, compliance, IT, treasury, banking).   Personally, David is very open and friendly.Bernard Page.   Bernard is a long standing employee of MG (since early 1970s) due to retire in October.   He's had various positions of responsibilities.   Prior to Enron's offer, he was winding down his career by planning MG's relocation from One America Square to 25 Cannon Street.   Now, it looks like he will be actively involved in relocating their offices to 40 G.   Bernard tends to be a little reticent until engaged in a conversation about MG's business, etc.   He has a solid understanding of the financial services division and an outstanding working knowledge of MG's office system infra-structure - - - if he doesn't know something, he knows where to get the answer.   I get the sense he has known Michael Hutchison for a long, long time.Michael Farmer.   Michael is Managing Director of the merchanting division and has over 30 years experience in the metals industry.   He started his career with A Strauss &amp; Co, a metal exchange broker and tin merchant.   He also worked for two other metal brokers and was formerly Desk Head (copper) for Philipp Brothers.   He jointly set up MCC, which is the (physical) merchanting division of MG, with Dieter Boettcher (Tom's father/uncle/relative???) who has subsequently retired.   Michael kindly explained the physical metals business to me and we immediately started connecting on commercial project development opportunities, particularly in copper.Michael Hutchison.

Hamish was a banker with Kleinwort Benson for 18 years and developed a strong relationship with MG during the latter part, which led to him being recruited and hired ~3 years ago.   He is very interested in promoting a \"credit culture\" that proactively assigns   limits and measures performance.   I get the sense that he has, in his quiet and friendly way, pushed for more credit control in a productive fashion - - - he wants to avoid adversarial relationships with the metals traders.   He is very open to Enron's ideas about credit and is known by a number of people (Lee Munden, Steve Young) at Enron.Tom McKeever.   Tom is the Executive Chairman and has been involved in the metals industry for over 222 years.   He joined MG in 19994 when he became responsible for the Group's US operations.   His experience with public companies (Amax) as a manager and director made him a very credible manager for MG during their IPO and period of public holding.   He lends stability and balance to the executive team.   He is very practical; for example, he wants to know who from Enron is going to contact MG staff - - - he doesn't want them, in their enthusiasm to be open with Enron, to reveal proprietary information to an unscrupulous competitor posing as Enron!Tom Boettcher.   Tom joined MGAG in 19993 as a Vice President of the Metal Division, Head of Copper.   He became a Director of MCC in 19995.

I'll forward over any other information I can find.   USA: Metal exchanges hold firm as Web trading blooms.06/222/2000Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000. NEW YORK, June 222 (Reuters) - The world's two largest metal exchanges said they will retain their roles despite the rapid expansion in Internet trading and as another major metal dealer announced the launch of an online trading system on Thursday. The London Metal Exchange (LME) is carefully planning its introduction of electronic trading in the second-half of this year and refuses to be \"spooked\" by those \"urging action, any action, as long as it is now,\" Jonathan Haslam, LME director of corporate affairs, told a conference in New York.His comments were echoed by Patrick Thompson, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), who said it would be very difficult for the new online trading systems to bring together those elements that underpinned the success of the traditional exchanges. Thompson told the Metal Bulletin E-Commerce 2000 conference that said these elements included the handling of counterparty credit risk, the clearing of trades and the existing pools of liquidity provided by the different segments of the metals market which use the exchanges. Haslam compared the LME's trading turnover averaging $8 billion a day with the around $1.5 billion a day traded online by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp. . Enron's expansion in the e-commerce market was earlier referred to by Thomas Pimpinelli, senior vice president of MG London Inc. part of U.K.-based metals trading group MG Plc . In May, MG agreed to a 3000 pence per share cash offer from Enron. Pimpinelli said MG's own MITS online metals trading system, launched in October 1999, has to date processed over 135,000 contracts with an overall value of $5.25 billion. He told the meeting that between 65 percent to 80 percent of MG's order flow, mostly from small metals clients, was now done over the Internet. Pimpinelli said the success of its \"Market Maker\" real-time trading facility within MITS for tonnages of up to a 1,000 tonnes, had encouraged the company to create a new product for the Managed Futures industry called \"CTA Trader.\" The product will differ from Market Maker in that the customer can trade larger volumes, request a volume quote on-line, and then have the facility to book the resulting live on-line quote. \"Once executed the customers will need to breakdown or allocate the transaction to his individual or multiple pre-approved clearing houses by way of a dropdown menu,\" he said. Pimpinelli added that CTA Trader would be launched in the next month or so. Sharing a platform with Pimpinelli, Karl Hackert, head of e-commerce at U.S. trader Koch Metals, announced the impending launch of his company's own online metals trading system by the end of June. Koch metals is a unit of Koch Industries Inc. . Hackert said the issue of the LME's daily forward prices valuation at 5.30 p.m. in London, meant that the level of these quotes wasn't clear during the rest of the trading day. Under the new Koch system prices will be updated every five seconds and out to 27 months. \"Koch are the first to do this (offer near real-time forward prices) and it is a big step forward in terms of market transparency,\" he said. Hackert said Koch had built its system to better communicate with its clients and it did not intend to go into direct competition with the LME. \"Making a generic mass system? I don't think that's the business we're in,\" he said. (((Steve Hays, New York Commodity desk, 212 8591640)))... ?UK: UPDATE 2-MG to widen access to online metals trade.By Andy Blamey06/13/2000Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2000. LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - U.K.-based metals trading group MG plc said on Tuesday it would broaden access to its online metals trading systems as the battle for web pre-eminence comes to the boil. MG, one of the world's leading metals traders, said it would allow London Metal Exchance clearing members to use the system, which had been restricted to clients, with immediate effect.The move comes in response to strong demand for access to the system, an MG spokesman said. MG has so far signed up 14 Category One (ring dealing) and Category Two (associate broker clearing) members of the LME. \"We have decided to broaden the availability of Market Maker following the rapid increase in volumes and substantial uptake by both existing and new clients,\" said Michael Hutchinson, CEO of MG's Financial Services Division in a statement. \"We are confident that we have an online product which will meet demand from other clearing members of the LME.\" The wider access to MG's system need not necessarily pose a threat to other online marketplaces, said Gavin Gross, head of LME metals at brokerage Spectron Futures Ltd. Spectron plans to launch online systems to trade London Metal Exchange contracts later this month. \"They're very different models. MG is a principal in the market, so you're looking at MG prices only. Spectron is neutral, we're just providing a platform. It's a multilateral system with lots of dealers interacting with each other,\" Gross said. \"The two can exist side by side,\" he added. Over 80 percent of MG's clients are now using its online services, the company said. Market Maker turnover stood at 3,000 contracts in May - a growth rate of approximately 50 percent per month since the launch in January of this year. Online deals still make up a low proportion of MG's total trading turnover, however. MG's MITS system launched in October 1999 and has now processed over 95,000 contracts with a dollar value in excess of $3.8 billion and a monthly turnover in excess of $1 billion. \"We are using it (MITS) for the one or two lot small stop orders that you previously missed and had the customer ringing up asking if we had done his trade,\" said one user of an MG system at an ABCM. However, it would appear that MG is now limiting the size of the orders it will accept on MITS from its non-customers, he said. Metals e-commerce sites are proliferating, but they follow no single business model. There are portals run by single principals quoting their own prices; intranets where big market players are cooperating; different rules for access; and a wide variation in revenue models, the key to profitability. The company announced in March it had joined Internet Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund to form the EMETRA joint venture, in which MG has a 25 percent stake. EMETRA is building a worldwide business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce marketplace for the non-ferrous metals markets, including physical trading a futures and options contracts. MG contributed its Internet systems to EMETRA and continues to use MITS and Market Maker under a licence agreement with EMETRA. In May, MG agreed a 3000 pence per share cash offer from U.S. energy and communications group Enron, a major player in the e-commerce market through Enron Online, which trades around 840 products in some 13 countries in 111 currencies... ?US Enron Bid For MG May Signal End Of LME Outcry TradingBy Adam Aljewicz05/23/2000Dow Jones International News (Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron's (ENE) offer to buy London Metal Exchange ring dealing firm MG PLC (U.MGA) could bring the exchange one step closer to ending open outcry trading, dealers say. Both the U.S.-based energy and communications group, and MG have pioneered electronic trading and are widely seen as being among the only participants on the LME trading floor capable of making the transition to on-screen trading. The LME, meanwhile, is also seeking to introduce on-screen technology for out-of-ring trading sessions.\"We're not surprised in the least to see this tie-up take place,\" an analyst at Deutsche Bank told Dow Jones Newswires. \"Everything we see now is pointing toward the removal of the ring-dealing sessions, and it's just a matter of time before it ends all together,\" she said. MG's chairman Tom McKeever said the company won't abandon its position as an LME ring dealing member, but market watchers doubt whether - after 123 years - open outcry can survive on the LME as fast-paced technological change sweeps through the industry. Enron has made a GBP3000 million cash offer for London-based MG in a bid to gain a foothold in the $120 billion-a-year world metal market. The U.S. company already has a substantial market share in natural gas and electricity markets, and with its electronic trading platform, Enron On Line, it has already executed more than 1110,000 transactions valued at over $45 billion since its launch in November. \"It's not surprising to see a strategic link up between an energy and metals company because they're both very big in industrial commodities,\" said an analyst for a U.S.-based commission house. \"I think it's almost inevitable that open outcry trading will be a thing of the past,\" he said. Enron's move into the metals market has also been linked to the LME's growing interest in initiating an automated trading system, and has lead some market watchers to suggest that the Enron-MG tie-up will lead to greater consolidation among LME members. Metals trading companies and brokerage firms are struggling to survive as profits wane amid the growth of banks and funds in the metals trading arena. \"Out of the 13 ring dealing firms on the LME, I think only six will be able to make the transition to on-screen trading,\" said a dealer for a London-based bank. \"And that's only because we have a banking background,\" he said. The six cited are MG, the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia, U.S.-based brokerage Refco Inc., Credit Lyonnais Rouse, Barclays Capital and Fimat Metals. The LME's existing system involves the trading of eight metals within its circular trading floor. Around 35% of the LME's trading takes place there, but this figure could drop if the LME decides to abandon open outcry, traders say. \"Market participants will have to decide whether to use the ring or go through the Internet,\" said a dealer. \"That's how it will startand will probably lead to the trading floor being bypassedaltogether.\" MG, which was spun off from Germany's Metallgesellschaft last September, has pioneered the use of metals trading on the Internet with the launch in October of MITS and MARKET MAKER, its Internet trading system. MG is the second-largest physical merchant of copper, nickel and aluminum in Europe after Switzerland's Glencore. \"When profit margins are narrowing and so many LME companies are looking more and more uncertain about their future, MG (is) arguably the pick of the crop in terms of stability and profitably,\" said a dealer for a North American-owned ring dealing firm. LME Considers Screen Trading Separately, the LME has considered a series of moves that would also hasten the demise of open outcry trading. It has repeatedly said it is looking to develop an electronic screen-trading system for use in out of ring trading sessions, and that it plans to press ahead with changes to its ownership structure by demutualizing in favor of becoming a shareholder entity. \"We've made very clear that there are proposals for consequential changes to the LME's governance,\" said Jonathan Haslam, director of corporate affairs at the LME. The LME set up an eight-member committee in February which comprised four ring dealing members and four associate broker members to map out a strategy for the implementation of new technology. However, it has so far declined to comment on how this technology will be executed, although Haslam has said the LME is looking at around 20 companies with the requisite knowledge and background to provide and implement the on-screen technology. \"We said we would look into setting up an interoffice screen trading system but we have yet to come to a decision on who our technical partner will be,\" he said. \"But we should come to a decision in a couple of weeks.\" -By Adam Aljewicz; 444-20-7842-9353; adam.aljewicz@dowjones.com -0- 23/05/000 12-56G... ?Financial PostMG exceeds $1B Internet trade targetMartin HayesReuters04/05/2000National Post National !@SERIES=C14&amp;copy; Copyright 2000 Financial Post from National Post (formerly The Financial Post Company).

LONDON - International metals trader MG PLC said yesterday that business on its six-month old Internet trading systems had comfortably exceeded its transaction value target of $1-billion (all figures in U.S. dollars). \"We are at $1.5-billion as of this morning. We are are very pleased with the progress and the rate of growth,\" said Tom McKeever, MG chairman.He noted that online trading in metals is seen growing rapidly, according to a recent study by Anderson Consulting. Just 2% to 3% of business in the non-ferrous industry is currently conducted online, while in three to five years it will be 40% to 60%, he said. Since the launch in October, volumes on MG's internet systems, known as MITS and MARKET MAKER, have increased by 50% a month and cumulatively exceed 30,000 contracts now. MG said it had also gained customers as its systems are the only ones that currently offer online trading. \"When we launched the system, we had requests from many new customers to register. We registered quite a few new customers. It is beyond our expectations,\" Mr. McKeever added. The increase in on-line business on MITS has been seen round the clock as customers have become increasingly comfortable with the system. \"We were the first to start the system. It has been late coming to the metals business, but we think it is good for the industry,\" he said.

The volume of transactions has been increasing by 50% a month since October and cumulatively exceeds 30,000 contracts.The trading systems have attracted new customers as well as MG's existing customers because it is the only system currently available that offers them an on-line LME trading and execution service. The launch of MITS was announced in October 1999 by MG. In February, MG announced that it had joined with Internet Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund to form the eMetra joint venture, in which MG has a 25% stake. eMetra is in the process of establishing a worldwide business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce marketplace for the non-ferrous metals markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options contracts. MG contributed its Internet systems to eMetra and continues to use MITS and MARKET MAKER under a licence agreement with eMetra. Once eMetra is fully operational later this year, MG will become a user of eMetra's platform. Michael Hutchinson, Joint Chief Executive of MG plc, said: \"We are delighted that so many customers to date have transferred their business on to the Internet - we see this trend as increasing significantly in the coming months. It is proving attractive to new customers and enables us to give our existing customers a more efficient service.\" For further information: Michael Hutchinson, Joint Chief Executive MG plc Tel: 0171 4888 222444 Nick Denton/James Longfield Hogarth Partnership Tel: 0171 357 94777... ?City: MG plans to launch metals websiteJames Ashton02/111/2000The Daily Telegraph Copyright (C) 2000 The Daily Telegraph; Source: World Reporter (TM) MG, the international metals trader, yesterday unveiled plans to develop an internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals, in direct competition with the London Metals Exchange (LME). The joint venture with the Internet Capital Group (ICG) and private equity fund Safeguard International will establish a worldwide business-to-business e-commerce platform for non-ferrous metals. This will include physical trading and the trading of options and futures contracts.MG shares soared 140 1/2 to 3337 1/2 p. \"We didn't go into this venture intending to put anyone out of business,\" said chairman Thomas McKeever. He added that the as-yet-unnamed new venture would attract new clients, particularly small and medium-sized companies who regard conventional LME trade as too costly and complex. He said he also hoped to open up the derivatives market to smaller players. \"When you develop a global marketplace you attract, presumably, most industry participants,\" he added. Safeguard and Nasdaq-listed ICG, which already has stakes in more than 50 companies offering online trading in sectors such as industrial chemicals, plastics and cattle, have invested a total of $25 million in the venture, taking 30 and 45pc stakes respectively. MG, the world's largest copper merchant, will hold an initial 25pc, with an option to increase that to 50pc within eight months. The company, which floated last September at 205p, after being spun off from German engineering group Metallgesellschaft, will continue to operate its internet trading system Mits for existing customers. It began live internet dealing of aluminium and copper in January... ?MG expects MITS to be a hit.CHRISTIAN KOHL10/14/1999American Metal Market 8Copyright 1999 Information Access Company. All rights reserved. COPYRIGHT 1999 Cahners Publishing Company DUSSELDORF --- Only one week after London Metal Exchange trader Metallgesellschaft Ltd. launched its web site system that allows trade execution services on the Internet, it is optimistic that the concept will be a hit. \"It's been quite extraordinary,\" said Alex Health, MG's director of e-commerce systems. \"We've had something like 3000 reactions so far from both existing customer companies as well as new ones logging on.\" He said that the non-customers entering MG'S site (ww.mgltd.co.uk) ranged from large groups MG had wanted to make contact with for a longtime to small companies that Heath said he'd never heard of. \"Of course, it's LME Week now, so we are busy with socializing and making contacts there before we can reply to the requests we've received,\" Heath said. He noted that LME Week was one important factor in launching the Metallgesellschaft Internet Trading System (MITS) in time to display it at Broker's House by Tuesday evening. MG Plc's recent floatation also provided a major motivation for the project to raise MG's profile, he said: Heath said that MITS has not had an immediate effect on trading volumes beyond the regular market, activity, but 70. customers so far had used the facility for deals. He added that MITS might soon contribute to MG's customer base, but it would take some time for new parties attracted to the site to be registered as regular customers. At the beginning of LME Week, few LME trading companies were prepared to comment on MITS and its possible effect on metals trading. MG's presentations at the LME event were aimed at providing a clearer picture. \"I'd be extremely disappointed if the idea didn't spread as the Internet will inevitably be a big factor in trading,\" Heath said. He noted that MG put itself under pressure by moving before some other company with a similar project-in-the-making could enter the scene. \"Speed is a definite factor in the Internet, and we can claim to be leading into the new millennium in this regard,\" he said, adding that MG received many \"flattering comments\" from brokers. Peter Sellars of Barclays Bank Plc conceded that \"certainly they got there before anybody else\" but added that \"they won't have very much of a lead time.\" He said that the Internet was going to be the way of the future and that Barclays was making similar preparations, but so far offered a web site order trading system only for non-metallic futures. He noted, however, that web site trading would not satisfy all requirements. \"It's great for the small bread-and-butter stuff, but for long-term contracts it's gonna be tricky, isn't it,\" Sellars said. A spokesman at Triland Metals Ltd., another LME member, questioned whether MG was really embracing technology or vice versa. \"It could be a gimmick for customers, and it doesn't really mean they're successful with enlarging their customer base,\" he said. He noted that people were always interested in coming close but weren't necessarily keen on taking the final step. He said that Triland had no immediate plans for a similar service and that it was confining its web site plans to statistics and other basic information. \"They jumped the gun to a certain extent, but we'll have to see if it's successful or not.\"... ?European &amp; Emerging MarketsMG Launches First Internet Metals Trade ServiceA Wall Street Journal Europe Roundup10/05/1999The Wall Street Journal Europe 16(Copyright &amp;copy; 1999, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)

MG, which went public on the London Stock Exchange in September, offers a full trading and execution service on the London Metals Exchange.The system, which is called MITS, will be supported by a real-time price screen for all the metals traded on the LME and includes a multi-currency facility. The LME trades copper, aluminium, lead, zinc, nickel, tin, silver and aluminium alloy. In addition, customers can listen to a direct voice commentary from the floor of the LME during trading sessions. Technical analysis and market research on all LME metals is available and regularly updated. Customers can also access their position and valuation statements over a secure encrypted link to the firm's computer system. MITS can only be accessed by registered customers of Metallgesellsc haft Limited, MG's LME brokerage and trading arm. \"It is a customer service and it is live now to our registered customers,\" said Michael Hutchinson, MG's joint chief executive. MG's customers will also be able to listen to a direct-voice commentary from the floor of the LME during trading sessions. They will also be able to access their position and valuation statements over a secure encrypted link to MG's computer system, MG said. The LME is the world's largest non-ferrous metals market with 14 ring-dealing members who participate in the twice-daily important open-outcry sessions. The LME settlement prices for metals which are realized in the official morning trading sessions are the benchmark reference prices for most of the world's physical contracts. Outside the open-outcry sessions, LME business takes place over a 24-hour period via an inter-office telephone market. \"We are always interested in any new uses of technology. We will watch this with interest,\" an LME spokeswoman said. MG said it intended to develop its website to eventually include real-time physical metal prices and premiums.

He said that although the traders were OK, he needed to track down internal approvals over the next few days.   Notwithstanding the deadline, it would still be extremely helpful to our case if we received the Affidavit over the next couple of days.   We would file the Affidavit, and deal with the judge, hopefully convincing him to allow the Affidavit notwithstanding the deadlines he established (there is a good likelihood he would do so).   As mentioned it would be very helpful if we weren't the only party advocating the need for a comprehensive index before the judge.   Accordingly, if you have any residual pressure to bear on MS, it would be greatly appreciated.Peter.\n"

In certain instances, ENA already has a master in place with the counterparty or in other instances (TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc. &amp; Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation), ENA Legal is currently negotiating a separate master with the counterparty.The Gas Desk is pressing hard for a number of new masters with additional counterparties.   While we are set up to handle their requests, in light of the organization changes, it seems this may be unnecessary.   Even where ENA does not currently have or is not currently negotiating a master, they may prefer that the document be handled by ENA legal and avoid having to assign the master to them at a later date.   I would like to have your thoughts before I commit resources to handle these requests.If you prefer that we continue to pursue these new master, we have the resources available to proceed. Jim\n"

I have visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing your major groups.   It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K committee did.   We would have Fulbright &amp; Jaworski give our people general instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.   Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group.   I believe we need this inventory.   If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.   Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in agreement with the proposed plan.

Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding))).   I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. I would like suggestions as to:1)   Where to go.2)   What should be the focus of the business meetings.3)   Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?   I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 4)   And any other ideas you have.In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.   The first one will be Friday May 111th at 2:30 p.m.   Please add this to your schedule.   I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.   Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   RegardsJohn\n"

What was odd though was that although your email address appears correctly as a hyperlink (\"mhaedic@ect.enron.com\"), I noticed that the actual email reference was to someone at El Paso Energy, \"morrissont@epenergy.com\".   You can see this by right-clicking on the hyperlink and looking at the link's properties.   I believe this will cause emails intended for you to go to El Paso Energy.I don't know how often this link would even be used so this may not be a big deal...If you have any questions I may be reached at extension 53707.Hal\n"

Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be implemented by Enron.   We as the legal department have been asked to express our view on are the following:(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly express its \"endorsement\" of these polices?(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy?&amp;copy; Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 15.

We continue to feel the name of the committee(including Power) is not sufficiently expansive to accommodate the growingmarkets involving energy and other new derivatives. We were consideringsomething like Energy and Developing Derivative Markets?   We thought the oldname Commodities had a traditional rather than a forward-looking sound toit. What are your thoughts?   I like Energy/Emerging Markets Committee or Energy and Emerging Markets Committee.   2.   As we discussed a couple of weeks ago, invitesshould go to US companies and non-US companies with a US presence in theenergy/commodity markets. Non-members should be invited as in London. Wetold people at the London meeting about the Houston meeting so they are onnotice. Also, if there are minutes of that meeting produced soon they willprobably refer to the meeting so there may be no need to invite them.Individual call-ins should be discouraged, but we might consider givingpeople an opportunity to gather at ISDA NY and plug a small group in fromthere. It's unlikely we will get many people from NY to go to Houston justfor this meeting.   I am ok with plugging people in from NYC so long as we know exactly who we are plugging in.   3.   When you suggested Enron as the venue, were youoffering a conference room or should we be considering the Doubletree orsomewhere else?   .   Did we ever settle hours, etc. and whether there shouldbe some kind of \"social event\" afterwards and for whom?   All of this isobviously intended to increase the profile/activity of the committee;highlight the upcoming conference; focus on the issues that are not assignificant to the European committee. Should we agree to a general socialevent, we'll include in the attached draft invitation.   I am ok having a social event, but wonder if we shouldn't see how this meeting goes and plan next time accordingly.   Please schedule a room at the Doubletree.   I would suggest 3:30 and plan on a two hours meeting.   4. Attached is a draft invitation. Pleasecomment on the text, etc.   Would you prefer to be the signatory? No   &lt;&lt;Energy Agenda Draft.doc&lt;&lt;   I look forward to your thoughts.   Many thanks, Ruth - Energy Agenda Draft.doc\n"

The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=\rt=20\rare underway to restructure   Enron=01,s operations in South America.   The b=\rasic=20\rorganizational framework has been set.=20\r As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=\r=20\rresponsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=\r=20\rJoe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=\r=20\rto Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.

In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=\rO=20\rof Elektro until its ultimate sale.\r The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20\rElektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=\r=20\rEnron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=\r=20\rFrevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=\rnd=20\rArgentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=\r=20\rreputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20\rmanaged prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=\rs=20\rare pursued.\r The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20\rAmerica will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=\rrk=20\rbusiness model.   This model employs people, market making, physical=20\rcommodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=\re=20\rproducts to our customers.   It is people and intellectual capital based and=\r=20\renjoys high rates of return on invested capital.\r In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =\rto=20\rJoe and Orlando:\r=20\rThe Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.   The team will=\r =20\rfocus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=\r=20\rnatural gas and electricity, with the following goals:\r ? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=\r=20\rneeded by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20\rcapabilities;\r? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=\r=20\rvalue chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=\r=20\ropportunity;\r? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=\r=20\rquickly to capitalize;\r?

(PG&amp;E), in filings with the California Public=20\rUtilities Commission (CPUC) and California Independent System Operator=20\r(Cal-ISO), has requested that a rate cap be placed on wholesale purchases=\r=20\rin the state. The utility is asking the CPUC to lower the current rate=20\rcap from $250 per megawatt hour to $1000, or 10 cents per kilowatt hour.=20\rIn seeking the rate cap, PG&amp;E is joined by Edison International, the parent=\r=20\rcompany of Southern California Edison, and The Utility Action Network (TURN=\r),=20\ra ratepayer advocacy group.\r ANALYSIS: The current rate cap of $250 per megawatt hour in the wholesale=\r=20\rmarket of California resulted from the price spikes experienced in San=20\rDiego this summer. As San Diego Gas &amp; Electric had paid off its stranded=20\rcosts, the retail rate freeze in its area was lifted and SDG&amp;E customers=20\rwere exposed to market-based prices, which doubled and at times tripled=20\rdue to increased demand in the state and power supply concerns. PG&amp;E=20\rcustomers=20\rwere not exposed to the price spikes because, at the time, PG&amp;E had not=20\rpaid off its own stranded costs and was still under a retail rate freeze.\r Yet the company has felt the impact from the price spikes just the same.=20\rPG&amp;E buys a great deal of its power on the wholesale market, and as a resul=\rt=20\ris about $2.2 billion in debt (some figures suggest it is as high as $2.7=\r=20\rbillion). Due to the retail rate freeze still in effect, PG&amp;E has been=20\runable to pass this debt on to customers by raising its rates. In real=20\rterms, PG&amp;E was paying up to 19 cents per kilowatt hour on the wholesale=20\rmarket this summer, when by law it was only allowed to charge its customers=\r=20\ron average 5 cents per kilowatt hour. In total, PG&amp;E has paid about $2.7=20\rbillion more to suppliers than it can bill customers for, and this amount=\r=20\ris growing by hundreds of millions each month. This explains the utility's=\r=20\rmotivation in wanting to see the CPUC further lower the cap on wholesale=20\rrates in California.\r However, even though PG&amp;E as a whole is in debt, the utility=01*as well as=\r=20\rother divisions under parent company PG&amp;E Corp.=01*is still making money of=\rf=20\rderegulation in California. For instance, PG&amp;E's Diablo Canyon nuclear=20\rplant has been able to capitalize on the high value of power on the wholesa=\rle=20\rmarket. The utility confirmed recently that altogether its power facilities=\r=01*\rthe=20\rones left after the utility was forced to divest the bulk of its power=20\rassets=01*still provide about $150 million a month to the utility. In addit=\rion,=20\rPG&amp;E Corp.'s unregulated energy commodity trading operation has been doing=\r=20\rvery well. And the unregulated National Energy Group=01*which operates in=\r=20\rmarkets outside of California, such as Massachusetts, Rhode Island and=20\rNew Hampshire=01*posted a 2333-percent profit increase for the second quarte=\rr.=20\rThus, it is important to note the distinction between PG&amp;E and its parent,=\r=20\rPG&amp;E Corp. Ironically, as a whole, PG&amp;E Corp. has stated that it does not=\r=20\rsupport rate caps, and has opposed the issue when it has surfaced in other=\r=20\rstates.\r PG&amp;E reported second-quarter earnings of $216 million on $2.3 billion in=20\rrevenue, representing a 26-percent increase over the same quarter last=20\ryear. Third quarter earnings also reportedly will be strong. This puts=20\rPG&amp;E in an awkward predicament. On one hand, PG&amp;E wants to convince=20\rshareholders=20\rthat the company is doing well and making money from the commodities that=\r=20\rit sells. On the other hand, PG&amp;E is attempting to convince regulators=20\rthat it is losing money due to the high wholesale prices that it must pay=\r=20\rfor power. In fairness, though, the revenue PG&amp;E has earned cannot come=20\ranywhere near to paying off the massive debt the company has accrued due=20\rto its obligation of serving customers.\r PG&amp;E's rate freeze is scheduled to end March 31, 20002, at the very latest,=\r=20\ror sooner if it is determined that PG&amp;E's stranded costs have been repaid,=\r=20\rsomething that utility executives say may already have taken place. Due=20\rto higher-than-expected revenues and higher-than-market valuations of the=\r=20\rutility's assets, it may very well be the case that PG&amp;E's stranded costs=\r=20\rare already paid off. When this is officially determined by the CPUC, PG&amp;E=\r=20\rwill argue that customers should be liable for some or all of the debt=20\rit has assumed while the rate caps were in place. The CPUC has scheduled=20\ra hearing to address these issues on Oct. 19. The core question of these=20\rproceedings will be whether or not PG&amp;E should be allowed to turn over=20\rits debt to customers through rate increases once the rate freeze is lifted=\r.=20\rPG&amp;E wants to be able to retroactively bill customers for its debt, based=\r=20\ron the date which the CPUC determines that PG&amp;E had in fact paid off its=20\rstranded costs, a point groups such as TURN will surely protest.\r It may seem surprising that TURN was among the group with PG&amp;E that filed=\r=20\rthe petition to lower the rate cap on wholesale prices. Typically, TURN=20\rand PG&amp;E (along with most utilities) are at polar opposites regarding most=\r=20\rissues. However, both agree that wholesale rates are too high and want=20\rto see a new cap put into place, but for completely different reasons.=20\rTURN says that PG&amp;E and other utilities took a risk when agreeing to the=20\rrate freeze and they should not be allowed to pass debts that resulted=20\rfrom that risk onto customers. TURN continues to retain a watch over the=20\rproceedings related to PG&amp;E's proposal, specifically with regard to the=20\rpossibility that the CPUC will allow the utility to raise rates on customer=\rs.\r Within the course of these new developments, it's important to be clear=20\ron PG&amp;E's motivations. Some California lawmakers and consumer advocates=20\rhave called for a complete return to regulation, arguing that deregulation=\r=20\rin California has become a failed experiment. Many have surmised that PG&amp;E'=\rs=20\rproposal for wholesale caps is essentially a call to return California=20\rto a regulated structure. I think this is a misinterpretation. PG&amp;E has=20\rvery clearly stated that its proposal is a \"necessary short-term step to=20\rtry to bring prices back in line.\" PG&amp;E's efforts really shouldn't be viewe=\rd=20\ras a move to return California to a regulated market. Rather, PG&amp;E is merel=\ry=20\rattempting to protect its own interests. The utility wants to secure=20\rtemporary=20\rlower rates for the power it needs to buy on the wholesale market and=20\rtransfer=20\rits debts to customers once the rate freeze is lifted. A return to regulati=\ron=20\rvia a permanent rate cap would not be in PG&amp;E's best interests as it=20\rcontinues=20\rto sell power from its nuclear plant. In addition, PG&amp;E probably recognizes=\r=20\rthat regulation would discourage additional companies from building new=20\rpower plants in California, which would not be good for the long-term econo=\rmy=20\rof the state. This also would do little to lower wholesale prices in=20\rCalifornia.=20\rAs we discovered this summer, the less supply, the higher the price for=20\rpower.=20\r PG&amp;E's proposal to lower rate caps on wholesale prices is, more than anythi=\rng=20\relse, an attempt to protect itself from what it perceives as disastrous=20\reconomic impact if it is not able to transfer its debt to customers.

However, we, IBJ, are probably the most enthusiasticabout it. Historically, we have kept the strongest relationship with theelectricity companies and oil refineries. Their bond issues keep oursecurities subsidiary on the top book runners list. Therefore, we areresearching on the product. Other Japanese firms seem to be lessinterested.Although I would think it should take a while to persuade those mostconservative companies like Tokyo Electricity et al., the product doeshave a potential here.In fact our derivatives and math men were really keen to talk to you andlearn more about the product.Please let me know if I can be of any further help.Terry\n"

As you may know, we are going through a merger here (Coastal/El Paso).? As a part of the merger-related activity, Engage (which is a limited partnership) is being split as between its two owners, Westcoast and Coastal. Virtually all of my clients (the \"big deal\" Structured Power Group here at Engage) are moving with a subsidiary of our other owner, Westcoast, while I am remaiining here in Houston with Engage, which is a Coastal subsidiary.? So, despite the fact that power is a growth area, my propsects vis a vis the merger are less good than if I were still supporting a substantial client base.? So, I am now looking at other opportunities that may be available, despite the fact I have been with Engage only a year.Attached you will find a cover letter and my resume.? I hope you find my credentials and background of interest and I hope to hear from you soon.I will forward a hard copy of the attached documents to you as well.?

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any \" future California\", we propose the following changes:1.   Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All Commodities --- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts.   Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.2.   Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures --- where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty, a \"bridge\" should be put place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters.3.   Merge EPMI into ENA --- power trades are done through EPMI.   Merging EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view.4.   No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event --- Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading.   I believe these changes will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (ii) develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve Enron's position in the next California type market.

Quinn Emanuel is a litigation firm of approximately 1000 attorneys based in L...A.   Their client list and litigation record are impressive.   From what I have read and heard, they strike me as the \"Susman Godfrey\" of L.A. (and could be even better).   Bill worked with Jonathan Sumption on an arbitration, they became friends, and now whenever Bill is in London he stays in Sumption's home.   I think we should keep the firm in mind for California litigation and international arbitrations. \n"

I think it is a good policy, although I am still not as convinced as Sami is that the courts in Brazil will so cavalierly disregard international arbitration provisions. Nevertheless, I think it was necessary to change our policy from a commercial perspective; we were getting too much resistance to foreign arbitration.   Now the question is, do we go the next step and see if Jim will approve submitting to the jurisdiction of some courts in Brazil which are generally reliable and free of corruption (e.g., Sao Paulo and Rio) if the counterparty rejects arbitration, and the largest sum of money that would ever be in dispute would be less than $5000,000?

Corporate Structure - To facilitate the meshing of EES' existing Canadian affiliate (Enron Energy Services Canada Co. Ltd. (\"EES Canada\"))) and Enron Canada Corp.'s mass market retail venture (Enron Direct Limited Partnership (\"Enron Direct Canada\"))), I propose a simple corporate structure as follows:Enron Direct Canada's business will be set up as a subsidiary of EES Canada.   This will involve:a. a general conveyance of the assets of Enron Direct Canada to its general partner, Enron Direct Canada Corp.;b. the sale of the shares of Enron Direct Canada Corp. from Enron Canada Corp. to EES Canada; andc.   a services agreement whereby Enron Canada Corp. provides key services to Enron Direct Canada.By setting up Enron Direct Canada as a distinct subsidiary of EES Canada, both entities will continue to operate as they do today.As such, (i) Enron Direct Canada will continue to be operated by the staff currently in place in Calgary, but within the EES corporate structure, and (ii) EES Canada's existing business will continue to be operated as it is currently.B.   Governance - I understand from Peter that a few years back, it was decided, for corporate law and, more importantly, tax-related \"permanent establishment\" issues, that all directors and officers of Enron Canada Corp. would be Canadian-resident employees of Enron Canada Corp.   Accordingly, Enron Canada Corp. was re-organized with a nominee board of directors now consisting of Rob (as the senior Canadian commercial employee) and Peter (as the senior Canadian legal employee) with officers being the Vice-Presidents or Managing Directors in Canada responsible for the various commercial or commercial-support groups. Following this model, Rob Milnthorp and an employee from the legal department would appear to be the appropriate directors of the EES' Canadian subsidiaries.   In the short term, the Iegal employee/designee would be me; however, the new lawyer hired to work for Enron Direct Canada would assume the role. With respect to the officers, no changes are required with respect to Enron Direct Canada.   With respect to EES Canada, I propose that Rob be appointed as the Chairman, President and CEO and I be appointed as Secretary for the interim.Unless I hear otherwise, I will proceed on the basis of these proposals.Regards,Mark Powell\n"

The concern is that having officers and directors located outside of the country of incorporation of the subsidiary could provide a basis for a country other than the one where the subsidiary is incorporated to assert taxing jurisdiction (the PE issue).   That said, I appreciate the control concern and so long as the authority of the non-Canadian Director is never exercised outside of Canada (of course, this presents a proof issue) having a non-Canadian Director is permissible (from a tax perspective, that is).   Let me know whether such a restriction would be compatible with the expressed control concern.   Steve.

My thoughts are as follows:1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place and there is master agreement already signed.3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.Please give me your comments.Mark   \n"

The place I was telling you about is Galeria Jacques Ardies.   Jacques' gallery is one of the two best (I think) specializing in contemporary Brazilian \"naif\" artists.   Most of his stuff is really interesting, vibrant, \"Brazilian\" pieces (many from the Northeast of Brazil where they have the greatest African influence and a very rich culture).   Kind of funky and \"out there,\"   but I really like it.   He also has some terrific textile works by Madeleine Colaco, an artist who has become very popular in the United States (we have one of her wall hangings in our den).Jacques' web site is at http:///ardies.com/quemingl.htm.   I don't think it is very representative of what you will find there, but take a look.There are plenty of other galleries that you can go to as well. Let's talk about what you want to see on the way down, and I will give it some thought.By the way,   I am scheduled to have lunch with Lance on Thursday, and I have a phone call into Alan asking for a time with him as well.   I will keep you posted.Regards,Randy\n"

This is a total energy management services deal where Enron Argentina is currently providing billing services to Azurix Argentina.   The TEM Agreement was executed on August 25, 2000.   The contract term is 3 years and the NPV is approximately US$9000,000.Azurix Argentina is facing a very difficult situation arising from its Buenos Aires Province water concession agreement.   Over the past few days, local newspapers have informed that Mr. Carlos Ruckauf, the BA Governor, has called a local congress extraordinary session \"to consider the early termination of Azurix water concession agreement\" (sic).   The BA Province is claiming that Azurix did not fulfill the contracted investments.   In case the Azurix concession is revoked, our agreement will also be terminated.Rgds,Sami\n"

One note,   Enron already adopts an entire needy Elementary School for the holiday seaso, and our employees adopt each child in the school by donating money, etc. to provide supplies and clothing for the children, so I am a bit concerned about another big employee drive during the holidays.   However, we have a number of ideas that I will share below, knowing that it may take some time to schedule a meeting for the three of us:1.   Partner with 104 KRBE to promote a Bike Drive in partnership with Sun &amp; Ski Sports (one of KRBE's sponsors).   Enron could pay for the advertising dollars and Sun &amp; Ski could get shoppers to make donations toward buying bikes.   Laura Schwartz is exploring KRBE's appetite for something like this.2.   BEAR/CPS table at our December 1 Big E Cafe which highlights ways for employees can get involved throughout the community during the holidays.   BEAR could use the opportunity to ask for donations as well as offer volunteer opportunities.3.   Partner with the Enron Cycling Club to donate bikes - leverage their connections with local bike stores.   These employees might be more likely to want to donate.2.   Utilize Matching Dollars (up to $15,000 per employee annually) if Mark or other employees are interested in contributing.   Additionally, if Mark or other employees volunteer with BEAR, using VIP dollars (up to $25000) to pay for bikes.Please let me know your thoughts, so that we can pursue some of these opportunities.   Elyse\n"

As we have blithely sailed along with BPA up until now, we often say to ourselves,   \"Oh, when you contract with BPA, you are backed by the good faith and credit of the United States of America.\"   I would like you both to put your heads together and decide who at your firm can give us a memo addressing BPA's payment mechanisms from a legal, statutory perspective.   It bothers me to hear things like;   \"they only have $7000 million in their warchest,\"   or \"if they can't make their Treasury payment they are toast.\"   What do these kinds of remarks mean to us legally?   Are we contracting with the surplus bloated   Treasury of the United States of America or are we going to have a rude surprise and find out that we are contracting with one of these discrete funds that can run out of cash and be held hostage by warring politicians?   We need a concise legal analysis of this point very soon. ---cgy \n"

I understand that our meeting with Jim Derrick and you has been rescheduled to the first part of March.   Your assistant gave us the choice of March 1 or 2.   Although we can accommodate both dates, March 1 works better for David Jackson.   Our understanding is that Blakes is not getting any further work from Enron as a result of the circumstances under which we could no longer continue acting for Enron in litigation involving Westcoast, another Blakes client.   As you can well imagine, the prospect of losing our valued relationship with Enron is extremely disappointing, especially considering the significant inroads we had made during the last couple of years in getting to know Enron, its various businesses and representing your interests on a number of major transactions and initiatives in Canada.   At this point in time, we need to better understand where we stand and whether there is any prospect of representing your interests in Canada.   One of our concerns in trying to mend fences is our relationship with your Calgary office which we perceive to be paramount in any effort to re-establish the kind of relationship we had with Enron prior to this incident.   As a result, we would like to seek your views on this prior to our meeting in Houston so as not to further aggravate our relationship with the Calgary office. David Jackson and Jim Christie, two key members of our senior executive, and I would be available to discuss this matter with you at your convenience Wednesday, Thursday or Friday of next week.   Perhaps you can let me know what works best for you and we could initiate the call.   Thanking you in advance for your kind consideration.   Best regards,   Dan   \n"

Neither does any other group but that is not my problem.   I have spent too much time reading DASH forms which really do not provide full authorization.There are two suggestions that I would like to be implemented:(i) DASH forms need to include all of the contracts which are to be signed under the deal.   So if a DASH is signed then this authorizes all of the contracts to be signed in the deal.   Any contracts which are not included need to go through the process outlined below.(ii) All contracts need a Contract Approval Form attached and Enron's legal team cannot initial any contract until this form has been completed (ie signed) by the following Enron staff.Trader/Originator ___Head of Group (VP or above)___Credit___Legal___Tech Services (where applicable)___Commercial Support (where applicable)___A database of all completed contracts on behalf of Enron Americas needs to be maintained by Legal.Thoughts please?\n"

I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.   We can't ignore that.   Let's generally talk that through with Jim.Regards,Mark\tPeter Keohane\t03/07/20001 08:46 AM \t\t\t To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Canadian CounselMark, a few thoughts:1.   Dan Fournier asked me to go to lunch so he could update me on his \"very positive meeting\" with Jim and you.   I told Dan, politely, that I am very tired of talking to the issue and really have nothing more to add.   I hope that is OK with you.   To be honest, I am really tired of talking to the issue and dealing with Dan Fournier's political maneuvering, but I am also concerned that it seems apparent that the result of his meeting with you and Jim is that he thinks he is back in the saddle with Enron.   I have lost trust and confidence in Dan Fournier and as I mentioned Dan's approach within Blakes becomes exclusive and results in inefficient allocation of Blakes resources to our files.   He tries to conquer the client and thereby alienates the talent within his firm.   I know for a fact, after he has squeezed others out on our work and his mismanagement of this issue with Enron, that if Dan is back in the saddle, many of his partners will not been keen on doing our work under Dan's terms.   I also know that there is a philosophy in Houston to commercial people not having say in legal retainers, but I believe that the senior commercial people who are responsible for the transactions, particularly in a smaller office in a smaller market, have an important place in the relationship, and in that regard, I know Fournier has lost the trust and confidence of Rob Milnthorp.2.   Regarding Donahue Ernst and Young, it should be borne in mind that the initial contact to doing work at their firm was through Jordan Mintz and Morris Clark on the tax side.   I also know Jordan thinks well not just of their firm but of the multidisciplinary business model.   I also think that Jim needs to understand that the business model is likely not going away, and likely to expand in Canada, the US and Europe and is something we likely cannot ignore.   Also, the circumstances you will recall for us using DEY initially was on regulatory and contracting issues affecting the retail market, where the incumbent firms with any experience in the area were all conflicted and in an area where Blakes is particularly weak in Calgary.   (We first approached Stikemans, which had conflict with Enmax, and Bennett Jones, which had a conflict with ATCO.   Other firms which we do not typically use but which had experience also had conflicts.   After that, I solicited written propsals from both Blakes and DEY and interviewed with them with the retail team.)   Frankly, DEY has done good work for us.   E&amp;Y is also very well situated on the market development side in Ontario, a leading proponent of deregulation of the Ontario market, and worked with us to set up our systems in Toronto for market opening.3.   Should I e-mail to Jim a proposed agenda for our call on the 20th outlining the firms we currently use in different capacities in Canada?   Blakes, Bennett Jones, Stikemans, Oslers, Donahue E&amp;Y, or is a less structurd call anticipated?Peter.Peter.\n"

Over the last few days, the form of the paper pursuant to which Enron Canada will trade physical power in Canada has been reviewed and (I think) finalized by legal in Calgary and Houston and the commercial people in Calgary.   We have determined that it is in the best interest of Enron to jointly promote the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) form of master which, as I described in my e-mail of yesterday, consists of a standardized base contract with an amending section, much like the ISDA form of financial master.   However, as the current form of the EEI master is a US document, containing many US specific provisions that have no application in Canada, commercially it has been identified as a concern that, with respect to counterparties that are not sophisticated trading companies, selling a US document with a Canadian addendum will be difficult if not impossible.Therefore, we are going to proceed to finalize the form of \"industrial master\" that I have drafted and sent out numerous times for review, a copy of which I enclose in both a clean and black-lined version (black-lined to the most recent draft distributed to you) in what I now believe is, in fact, final form.   Our commercial people can use this form, together with the form of GTC I distributed to most of you earlier today, to market power in Alberta to counterparties who will not accept the EEI form.We will immediately begin the process of supporting the use of the EEI form in Canada but will propose that a Canadian form of base contract be agreed to and implemented, thereby eliminating the problem of using a US document as the base contract for Canadian transactions.   I will begin the process of trying to create a first draft of this base contract which, other than with respect to removing US references and incorporating specific Canadian principles, will be identical to the US form.   I will also commence the process of preparing what Enron believes the form of addendum to this Canadian base contract should be.Sorry for the lengthy e-mail, but I wanted to ensure that everyone was completely up-to-date with the status and process.   I believe that this solution will address everyone's concerns without jeopardizing commercial transactions in Alberta.ThanksGreg\n"

In particular the opinion specifies that Section 2(a)(ii) should not be altered.   Enron has a standard alteration to Section 2(a)(ii) in Part 5 of its standard form Schedule, viz.   \"(a) Conditions Precedent.   The condition precedent set forth in clause (1) of Section 2(a)(ii) shall not apply to payments owed by a party if the other party shall have satisfied in full all its payment obligations under Section 2(a)(i) and shall at the relevant time have no future payment obligations whether absolute or contingent, under Section 2(a)(i).\"Obviously, in the case of Australian counterparties this condition precedent should not be included in our documentation.In addition, there are a number of other countries (including Germany, Italy, South Korea and Switzerland) where the effectiveness of the ISDA netting opinion presupposes that certain Sections of the Master, including Section 2(a)(ii), are not altered in any material respect. To that end I would suggest that our standard condition precedent does make a material alteration and that it should not be included in ISDA Master Agreements with counterparties trading from these jurisdictions.Certainly from the London end, I think that when we start negotiations with a new counterparty we should check the ISDA opinions to ensure that we don't trip ourselves up.Regards, Edmund\n"

There are still a few unanswered questions relating to the EWS structure --- such as whether EWS will be an actual entity or simply an unincorporated \"umbrella\" of certain businesses.   In large part, the revisions are simply more flexible versions of old language in light of these unanswered questions.

It was through that company that I developed a relationship with Enron and subsequently came to work here in 19993.   Since coming to Enron, I have maintained regular contact and networks with several of my former partners.   One of them, Barry Curtiss-Lusher, started up his own oil and gas exploration and production company, Nexus Resources, in Denver.   Barry has recently asked me to join his Board of Directors.   Reviewing the Enron Code of Ethics (specifically, page 57, July 2000 edition) I wanted to provide the following information:Nexus Resources, 650 S. Cherry St., Suite 420, Denver, CO   80246Barry Curtiss-Lusher, President/CEOprivately ownedprinciple business is oil and gas exploration and production in various basins throughout the U.S., primarily in Louisiana, Kansas and the Rocky Mountain statesMy role as a Board member would be similar to any other Board role with regular meetings on a quarterly basis (teleconferencing is permitted under Nexus' bylaws) with all expenses, if any, paid by Nexus.   Currently, Nexus does not pay any cash stipend to its Directors.   It does, however, compensate Board members with Nexus stock.   Additionally, I would be making a minor personal investment in Nexus stock.Pursuant to the Enron Code of Ethics, I would/will NOT be performing any managerial, professional or other duties which would interfere with my own specific job performance at Enron.   Nor is Nexus currently involved in any business which competes, directly or indirectly, with that of Enron Corp. or any of its subsidiaries.Although I have been nominated and approved by the current Board of Directors of Nexus Resources, I have NOT yet accepted the position pending resolution and approval by Enron Management pursuant to the Code of Ethics.

H.R. 4541 passed the House 3777-4 last evening and Enron strongly supports the legislation (I will e-mail Ken Lay's letter to Chairman Combest which expresses our support plus some talking points for your information.)   There is a real opportunity to enact this legislation this Congress.   The last deal which needs to be cut is with Senator Gramm (he is the only obstacle to enactment in the Senate.)   The \"Energy Provisions\" discussed in this press release are NOT IN PLAY and will not be changed in the Senate.   It is other provisions which do not directly affect Enron which are being negotiated.Contrary to this release's statement, no House member (other than one member who didn't make it for the vote,Congressman Baker) is asking for changes in the Senate.   The overwhelming numbers speak for themselves.   All and all, this press release is outlandish.This will be our highest priority next week and changes occur by the hour.   Please call if you do indeed get press calls and need our assistance.   Many thanks.EXCHANGE EXPRESSES OUTRAGE AT HOUSE PASSAGE OF H.R. 4541NEW YORK, NY, October 20, 2000 --- In response to passage by the House ofRepresentatives last night of H.R. 4541, the Commodity FuturesModernization Act of 2000, New York Mercantile Exchange Chairman DanielRappaport issued the following statement:   The New York Mercantile Exchange finds it particularly egregiousthat, by approving subsection (g) (3) of Section 106, the House wouldnot only remove the energy and metals marketplaces from public scrutinyand regulatory oversight, but also do this in a fashion thatdiscriminates between established markets versus start-up electronicforums.It is particularly outrageous, at a time when every U.S. consumer isfeeling the impact of high energy prices, to allow lobbying by a smallgroup of vested interests to influence Congress to take these marketsout of the public eye and create an advantage for people to trade onprivate, proprietary systems lacking the protections of a neutralself-regulatory organization. Policy makers, regulators, and theAmerican public will be deprived of currently available information onmarket participation, concentration, and financial performance.This is not only a matter of ill-conceived public policy but is alsoanti-competitive and directly contrary to the recommendations made bythe President'sWorking Group on financial markets.Even House members who voted in favor of the bill have been publiclyquoted as saying that it must be changed in the Senate.The New York Mercantile Exchange plans to fight adamantly at the Senatelevel to demand that this subsection either be eliminated or be amendedto create a consistent regulatory policy for electronic and open outcrymarkets.# # #---This e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains informationthat may be privileged and confidential.

The purpose of the Act is to eliminate unnecessary regulation of commodity futures exchanges and other entities falling within the   coverage of the Commodities Exchange Act (\"CEA\") and the provide legal certainty with regard to certain futures and derivatives transactions.   By enacting such changes, Congress intends to promote product innovation and to enhance the competitive position of US financial markets. Certain provisions of the Act open the door for Enron's further product innovation and growth.   Specifically, the Act provides important legal certainty for energy and other transactions occuring both on an over-the-counter (OTC) bilateral basis and on multilateral electronic trading platforms.   Enron was a leading advocate of passage of this legislation.Bilateral TransactionsUnder the Act, bilateral transactions in all commodities (other than agriculture commodities) that do not occur on trading facility (i.e. not on a multi-party exchange) are exempt from most provisions of the CEA as long as the transactions are entered solely between \"eligible contract participants\"(i.e. persons and certain legal entities satisfying capital thresholds and other requirements under the Act).   This provision essentially codifies and expands existing CFTC exemptions for swaps and forward contracts, thereby eliminating a degree of legal ambiguity that has frustrated product innovation and growth.   Multilateral TransactionsIn addition, the Act creates a broad exemption for any agreement, contract or transaction in commodities (other than agriculture commodities) so long as they the transactions are between \"eligible commercial participants\", are entered into on a \"principle-to-principle basis\" and that take place on a multi-party \"electronic facility\".   This exemption could facilitate expansion of EnronOnline to allow for multi-party transactions, however certain legal requirements will have to be met.Other TransactionsThe Act also creates a broad exclusion for a number of commodities that are of interest to Enron, including \"credit risk measure\" commodities and weather derivatives .   Again, the derivative transaction exclusion will have to meet certain legal thresholds.This legislation has been over six years in the making and the collective support of many Enron employees has been crucial.   Thank you to all that have contributed to the passage on this important legislation.   We will have a more through legal summary of this legislation in the near future. Do not hesitate to contact me at (202) 4666- 9158 of Mark Taylor at (713) 853-7459 with any questions.\n"

First an attorney in our Philadelphia office has been askedto do some work for Wiser Oil Company as follows.   Wiser is acquiring thestock of a Canadian Corporation called Invasion Energy.   Enron Canada ownsabout 50% of the stock of Invasion.   Wiser has Canadian counsel who has askedus to work with them.   Enron Canada is represented by Bennett Jones LLP.Although we don't do any work for Enron Canada, I thought I needed to see ifanyone at Enron had any problems with Reed Smith getting involved in thistransaction as stated above.   I'm told an answer to this one ASAP would benice.Second question is a little more confusing.   An attorney in our New York officehas been asked by a broker for Enron Global Services to get involved innegotiating a financial guarantee insurance agreement about providinginsurance coverage for Winterthur International.   We would be representingWinterthur in the transaction.   I can get more information if needed.Thanks for checking on these Marty.   Let me know \n"

Centrans apparently plans to sell a piece of its interest to a Fund, in which Enron also owns and interest (although I do not know how much).We would represent Centrans in selling its interest to the Fund.   I am not sure, but I do not get the sense from my conversation with my partner that Enron plans to take an active role in the Fund purchase.   So, from a conflicts analytical standpoint, this would seem to be analogous to LeBoeuf representing a buyer in connection with the sale of an asset to a corporation in which Enron is a shareholder.Do you have any concerns with LeBoeuf representing Centrans on this sale?   Are there any unique facts or circumstances here that you may be aware of that could create a potential problem from your standpoint?   I assume this transaction would fall within your \"world\" but, if not, is there somebody else that I should check with on this?   We understand that Thelen Reid &amp; Priest is representing the Fund.Thanks, as usual, Mark, for your consideration.

Here's the story:   On October 30, I received a funding request for my approval of approximately $260,000 representing a cash advance request on   the Bernard No. 1 well, a 16,5000 exploratory well in the Cypress Program.   The request appeared pretty routine but as is our procedure, I had Don Rollins check it out .   Don discovered that we had already paid our cash call and this cash call represented our working interest partner, Kelley Oil's share, which is a highly unusual situation.   Checking further we discovered that   the well is being drilled under a farmout agreement from Kelley, who wanted to be operator.   Our guys (Thompson/Josey) wanted Enron (not Kelley)   to operate the well during the drilling phase but did not want to be official operator of record so they set up Rozel Onshore, our prospect generator in Lafayette to be our surrogate operator.   Kelley was upset about this and would not sign the Joint Venture Agreement unless the cash call provisons were deleted.   Thompson/Josey and team agreed and signed the agreement which has no initials from the Legal Department.   The effect of this was that Rozel/Enron would have to incur all the costs then bill and collect from Kelley.Rick, as you are aware, the cash call provision in a JOA is the primary credit risk mitigant that an operator has to ensure that his partners pay their share of well costs before costs are incurred.   This can be particularly good protection if a well gets in trouble with lots of cost overruns that partners don't   want to pay.   In this case, our surrogate operator, Rozel has no established credit with oil service companys and no money of his own so all services including the drilling rig are having to be prepaid by Enron 1000%.   The well is heavily front end loaded with costs with a total drill and complete exposure of over $4.0 million (if thing go ok!)I discussed this with Dave Gorte and Brad Larson and we all agreed   that we are forced to fund since the well is drilling and failure to fund would shut down operations.   Also, keep in mind that this will be an ongoing obligation (and risk exposure) during this entire drilling phase.Lessons Learned:   1) The E&amp;P merchant finance team has no business operating a deep S. Louisiana exploratory test.   2)   Important provisions, like \"cash call\" should never be given away without appropriate risk assessment and approval.Please call if you have questions. \n"

MSEB is now approx. 45 days late on payment in full of the October invoice.   They have paid only a relatively modest portion of that bill.   Payment on the November bill is about 15 days late.   The MSEB Chairman says that MSEB can't pay these invoices.At present, the Governments of Maharashtra and India are refusing to engage in a constructive dialogue on solving the non-payment issue and the 14000 MW that will come on line as part of Phase II.   They say that they recognize their obligations as guarantors of MSEB's obligations but are not interested in helping in any different capacity (e.g., GOI buys some or all of Phase II).Until just a few days ago, the lead India bank was refusing to fund even their own ongoing interest obligation.   At present, they are refusing to continue funding any other Phase II draw request.   The India banks have a great deal to lose and, in our opinion, should strongly consider continuing to fund Phase II.   It would seem that the lead India bank is scared, knaive or, worse yet, very pessimistic about Dabhol's future --- perhaps there are other reasons for their current position.We are meeting with the international banks in NY on Tuesday.   Our main goal is to convince them to continue to fund and to use their influence to have the India banks do the same.The current India legal crisis team is nearly identical to the 19995 India legal crisis team.   The same law firms and lawyers (both Indian and international) are continuing to play much the same roles.We have not identified any particular \"holes\" in Dabhol's legal position.   While the India newspapers have offered up various theories that might allow MSEB to cancel the PPA (frustration of purpose, etc.), none seem compelling.   No counterparty has offered up any of these theories directly to DPC.In the short term, we are preparing (1) a demand under the GOM guarantee and (2) a \"meet and discuss\" letter under the PPA.   The current plan is to serve these next week.   We are also preparing (3) an arbitration notice under the GOM guarantee, (4) a demand under the GOI guarantee and (5) an action against MERC.   MERC is the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission.   They have issued \"orders\" over the last year limiting the amount of power that MESB buys from Dabhol.   We do not believe that they have jurisdiction to do so.   We may or may not ultimately file this action.Let me know if I can provide any further information.Bruce\n"

Sandeep Katwala led a group reviewing our permits and approvals.   They feel pretty good about our compliance with these permits/approvals.   As you have heard on previous phone calls, the day tank seepage some time ago makes us the most nervous.   It seems to us that a release from the site resulting in substantial groundwater contamination plays pretty well in the court of public opinion given DPC's failure to \"come forward\" on the issue (even though it was advised at the time of the release that it had no legal obligation to do so).   Sandeep's note is below.PPA Review.   Paul Kraske led a group reviewing the PPA.   His memo on this issue is also below.   He feels pretty good about our ongoing compliance with the PPA.   The instances of the non-compliance are not particularly material and none would appear to play well in the court of public opinion.   I should also note that it would be very difficult for MSEB to lawfully terminate the PPA --- that remedy is not readily available to MSEB under the PPA terms.Both review efforts have relied somewhat on the representations of DPC personnel.   The India legal team was able to \"tie down\" many significant issues with written documentation but in many cases have relied on the oral representations of our own employees to confirm compliance with our obligations.There are a number of other legal review efforts underway and I will keep you apprised as these reviews progress.Bruce---",

Based on discussions with DPC personnel and a review of correspondence where relevant, no material non-compliance issues have surfaced which I feel would pose a problem under the PPA. There are two instances under the Reserve Bank of India approvals DPC has failed to submit reports to the Ministry of Finance within the time frame indicated; these are however minor issues. We have to accept that there may be practical instances where there may not be strict compliance at the site (eg the actual construction of physical assets is not strictly as per the layout approved by the authorities) but, from the discussions with DPC personnel none of these have come to light. On the environment approvals DPC has submitted compliance statements to the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board which confirm that DPC is in compliance with the conditions in the relevant approvals. We have relied on these statements as being accurate. With respect to the water pollution issue, as we saw on Saturday, DPC has notified MPCB pursuant to the show cause notice of the measures taken to mitigate the pollution off the site. That correspondence seemed to indicate that there should be no further problems with this issue. However, my sense is that we have not seen the end of this issue and in particular, the report currently being prepared by GSDA has not yet surfaced in final form. There is no guarantee that it will be positive. Shobhan's view that it is difficult to see how a Court would support an injunction of some sort shutting down the plant \"permanently\" given the remedial measures taken by DPC is persuasive - you can however see that it provides excellent ammunition for PR purposes.SandeepPaul Kraske12/111/2000 06:23 PMTo: Sandeep Katwala/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Bruce Lundstrom/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: jonathan.inman@linklaters.com, Pancharatnam Ramaswamy/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Suhas Tuljapurkar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: PPA Compliance - Attorney Client PriviledgedGentlemen-Attached is a short note we prepared summarizing our conclusions after an initial review of PPA compliance.

Davis is already planning to violate confidentiality provisions of CDWR contracts signed earlier this year.   The State of California simply cannot be trusted to honor its agreements.   Look at Davis's spin on breaching contract provisions:   State negotiators \"worried little about the [confidentiality] clauses\" in their haste to sign the contracts, but now, \"administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in long-term contracts.\"From here it is a very small step for Davis to justify breaking long-term contracts once prices go down in a year or two:   \"We didn't think a lot about the prices we were paying at the time because we were just trying to keep the lights on.   But now we are attempting to find a way around the payment clause.\"* * *On another note, thank you for meeting with me on Wednesday.   I am thrilled to be working for Enron.   Meeting with you, Jim Derrick, and others in the legal department reinforced my decision to join your company.   I am excited about our prospects for the future and will work hard to continue to add value and keep your confidence.Best regards,SteveDavis to divulge details of costly energy buys By Steve GeissingerSACRAMENTO BUREAU SACRAMENTO --- Amid mounting attacks on Gov. Gray Davis' energy-crisis secrecy, administration officials said Thursday they will soon begin revealing full details of the state's costly, last-minute power purchases aimed at thwarting blackouts. The Davis administration told ANG Newspapers that in the next two weeks it will start disclosing information on the initial, multimillion-dollar purchases it made on the volatile spot market in January. In doing so, the administration will begin honoring Davis' promise to reveal the details after a period of six months or less. The governor said disclosing the information any earlier would compromise efforts to hold down power costs. But there has been a growing chorus of protest of the secrecy from open-government advocates, consumer activists, Republican lawmakers and others. GOP legislators and news agencies have filed separate lawsuits, under the state's Public Records Act, seeking disclosure of details on about $8 billion in emergency, short-term purchases and additional billions on less costly, years-long contracts. A San Diego Superior Court judge is scheduled to issue initial rulings on the lawsuits today in San Diego. On Thursday, the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called on Californians to phone the governor's office in protest. \"The public has a right to know how our money is being spent and who is getting it,\" said Harvey Rosenfield, the group's director. The governor \"won't let us look at them (contracts) to make sure they won't cause further rate hikes in future years,\" Rosenfield said. \"It is also important to know how much power he has negotiated for this summer so we can determine how much it will cost us to stop the blackouts,\" he said. \"We believe the governor is refusing to divulge because the contracts are inflated and contain damaging provisions.\" Administration officials dismissed critics' assertions and said that full disclosure will eventually come when the data is no longer a sensitive marketing matter. Officials acknowledged for the first time, however, that some of the state's less costly, long-term power contracts with generators contain secrecy clauses that may prevent public disclosure. The administration said state negotiators were so intent on securing less expensive, long-term power supplies that authorities worried little about the clauses requiring them to keep terms of the contracts secret unless they have the suppliers' permission to divulge them Though violating the agreement could void the contracts, industry representatives said they doubted generators would break existing pacts. Suppliers might, however, sign no more contracts with the state, the representatives said. \"Apparently there are some contracts with that (secrecy clause), and our legal people are looking at it,\" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. \"I don't know what the end result is going to be, but it's the governor's intent to release the contracts.\" While administration officials insisted they are attempting to find a way around the secrecy clauses in long-term contracts, they said disclosure of the initial short-term purchases will soon begin. Maviglio said the administration will start posting the details of short-term, spot-market buys made in mid-January within the next two weeks on the Internet, easing a controversy that has enveloped two of Davis' fellow Democratic statewide elected officials. State Controller Kathleen Connell scrapped plans to reveal the costly state power bills in February during a dramatic, 111th-hour reversal under pressure from the Davis administration. The controller, who has emerged as a sharp critic of the administration's handling of the energy crisis, indefinitely postponed plans to put information from electricity-purchase invoices on the Internet and canceled a news conference to announce the disclosures. In March, Attorney General Bill Lockyer, representing Davis in this instance, provided Connell with a letter of advice that the governor is not legally bound to reveal the details of billions of dollars in state power purchases. Lockyer's letter said the public's interest in maintaining confidentiality in matters relating to negotiations between the state and prospective power contractors far outweighed its interest in disclosure. But Lockyer, a former East Bay politician, said last week he personally favors making public the details of the purchases. \"In my mind at least, and as a matter of philosophy, the expenditures are so extraordinary, the issues are so important, that the contracts ... need to be made public,\" he said at the annual meeting of the National Freedom of Information Coalition. Open-government advocates point to a recent poll conducted for the California First Amendment Coalition that indicates seven out of 10 Californians believe they are getting too little information about how state officials are responding to the power shortage, and a whopping 86 percent want details of long-term power purchasing contracts made public. \"Californians reject government secrecy as a matter of law in the state's Open Government Act,\" said Kent Pollock, the coalition's executive director. \"The poll results are an overwhelming repudiation of state policies that shield information from public scrutiny.\"\n"

E&amp;Y set up many of our systems in Toronto and Donahue E&amp;Y is currently assisting us on the wholesale side with Ontario Energy Finance Corporation (one of the deregulation off-shoots of Ontario Hydro) on finalizing the NUG management arrangement.   They are also very strong on tax, and may be able to assist non-ECC business units (i.e. Global Markets and EES) in Canadian initiatives.   Representatives of their firm are considering a trip to Houston in the Spring and asked me if they could visit with you and others within Enron in Houston.   I told them that we would be pleased, once the timing is right.   Once they have a date I will let you know to see if we can set something up. Peter.\n"

As we discussed several weeks ago, I am concerned that within Dan Rodgers current group of resources there is no one with ECT commodity transaction experience.   This lack of experience is very noticeable to our commercial team as the current legal group is on a steep learning curve and given our immediate deal requirements.   Dan and I spoke about this yesterday and agreed that he will expedite the effort to recruiting someone from within ECT.   I believe not only will this person help enormously within our current deal flow but he/she would be a great resource for the other EGM legal team members regarding commodity transactions.   The main reason for this note is to enlist your help to get the right person into the group.   I will routinely be checking with Dan as to the progress we are making on this effort.

Outside Costs --- require internal sign-off by GC and COO to spend more than $10,000 on a potential transaction AND a written transaction budget for proposed outside legal expenses more than $10,000.   Wherever possible, a firm cap on legal fees should be negotiated.   A memorandum will be sent from the GC and [Chairman of the Wholesale Group?] laying out the procedure to all employees.   3.   Selection of Outside Lawyers --- expressly add billing rates and efficiency as key considerations, in addition to quality, in the selection of outside counsel.   [Dave, we need to complete our discussion on this point.]   Our new policy needs to be reviewed with outside counsel.4.   Reopener!   --- need to review where business changes significantly.\tDavid W Delainey\t10/19/2000 12:333 PM \t\t\t To: Wes Colwell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephen H Douglas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Tholan/Corp/Enron@Enron, Brian Redmond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Thode/Corp/Enron@ENRON\t\t\t cc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mark Frevert/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t Subject: ENA Group ExpensesGuys, notes from the morning meeting.

While I think we should accept the risks, here they are all from our vantage point:First, El Paso could move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claimthe Guaranty Agreements do not follow.   Second, we could lose on our claims.   This would give El Paso the right to move the Swap Agreements from EPME and claim the Guaranty Agreements do not follow. Third, El Paso could fight us on the arbitrability of the GuarantyAgreement claim.   We could end up with two proceedings --- our arbitration anda court proceeding El Paso initiates on the Guaranty Agreement claim.Unfortunately, El Paso would have the opportunity to choose the forum on theGuaranty Agreement claim.Fourth, El Paso could counterclaim on the breach of the confidentialityprovision.   I think they would have a good argument that we have breachedthat provision by showing the Swap Agreements etc. to people outside thecompany such as our bankers.   I am not clear what damages they could claimbased on that alleged breach.I haven't heard anything to suggest there are other claims out there for ElPaso to assert, but we haven't done much investigating in that area either.I suppose if El Paso got really mad, they might look back over the negotiations in this deal and others to see if they have any other claims they could construct.Andy\n"

Inevitably, we have to fight hard for these \"concessions\" in our negotiations and end up leaving a lot of Enron consideration (not to mention blood and sweat) on the table to get these provisions inserted in our contracts.   If we are really being \"taken\" by these crafty Brazilian lawyers (like the former General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group), I think we should re-think the policy in this specific instance.Elektro, because it is the fifth largest electricity LDC in Brazil, has a long history of litigation in the Sao Paulo courts (we had a number of cases, you will recall, when we bought it, and have had others since). It is clearly not the only substantial, high-profile Brazilian company Enron has down here, making it a little hard for us to negotiate these provisions as \"foreigners\"   the way we do elsewhere.   By all means we should check with Jose Emilio, but if he shares Sami's (and, I have to say, my) concerns, I think we should consider making a special rule for Brazil-to-Brazil contracting transactions.   Perhaps we could have the first position be ICC arbitration in Sao Paulo (in English?), with a forum savings clause that states that if the arbitration provision is held unenforceable that the litigation will be in the courts (federal, if possible) of Sao Paulo.   The worst thing that could happen is that we enter into an arbitration provision, thinking we are safe, and end up in some court in a smaller city in a backwater part of Brazil where they are a little loose on the law and perhaps even looser on the concepts of justice, due process, etc.If you would like me to be involved in the further discussions, let me know.RandySami Arap01/10/20001 06:20 AMTo: Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, margalith@elektro.com.br, Randy Young@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Rob Walls@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project   Thanks again, Bob.I will call Jos, Emilio to check.   I agree that a foreign arbitral award is enforceable in Brazil (whether international or local aspects are under discussion) provided that you follow the \"exequatur\" procedure at the Brazilian Supreme Court.   I have personally participated in the enforcement of a foreign arbital award against Odebrecht a few years ago.However, the point I am raising is that in case one of the two Brazilian contracting entities challenge such foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter under dispute to a local court, it is most likely that the Brazilian judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case, in accordance with Article 888 (I)(II)(II) of the Brazilian Civil Procedure Code.   In such event, if Enron (please note that I am always &amp; only referring to an Enron Brazilian entity) agrees to a foreign arbitration clause with a Brazilian counterparty, it may end up resolving its contractual disputes at the Brazilian courts (and this is exactly what I am trying to avoid by suggesting ICC arbitration in S?o Paulo for all contracts entered into between two Brazilian entities).Even if the two Brazilian contracting entities refer the matter under dispute to foreign arbitration and, at the same time or at a later stage, one of the parties decide to challenge the foreign arbitration clause and refer the matter to the local courts, it is most likely that the Brazilian Supreme Court will recognize the local courts jurisdiction and decide that the foreign arbitration clause was null and void.I will be in Houston on Friday, January 26, and would very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter in detail with you and possibly with Rob Walls and/or Jim Derrick.Regards,SamiRobert C Williams@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT01/09/20001 10:18 PMTo: Sami Arap/SA/Enron@ENRONcc: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, margalith@elektro.com.br@ENRON, Randy Young, Rob Walls Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project   Sami,I agree on the issue of Brazilian law.   But on the question of foreign arbitration, our advice has been that such a clause will be enforced by the local courts, even if the dispute has no international aspects other than the parent is foreign (although there was a dissenting opinion from one lawyer on this issue).   Could you check this point with Jose Emilio Pinto at Tozzini or Fernando Serec?   As to local arbitration, we have accepted this where the dollar amount of the disputes is likely to be less than $5000,000.   We should probably also have a cumulative cap of, say, $5 million.   On bigger deals, Rob orJim have resisted local court jurisdiction.   The most flexible they have been to my knowledge where more $ is at stake is to agree to ICC-administered arbitration in Sao Paulo.   In this case, I think we should propose the local arbitration procedure which would is best calculated to result in an impartial award, whether that be ad hoc, ICC, FIESP, or Canadian-Brazilian C of C.   Jose Emilio would have a view on this, too.   Hope this is helpful.Bob   Sami Arap@ENRON01/09/20001 04:48 PMTo: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: margalith@elektro.com.br Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project   Michelle and Bob;Thanks for the reply.   The issue here is when Brazilian entities (only) are entering into a contract which obligations will only be performed in Brazil and such agreement is governed by Brazilian laws.   My understanding of the Enron arbitration policy (and please correct me if I am wrong) is that when Enron (as a foreign company) is dealing with foreign governments, governmental agencies or government-owned companies, or private companies from the host company, we must follow our internal policy by choosing preferred arbitration rules, preferred place of arbitration and preferred governing law.In case of Elektro, as well as any other Brazilian Enron entity (EAS, ECE etc), entering into a contract with another Brazilian party with obligations to be performed in Brazil, such contract will most likely be governed by Brazilian laws.   Although the parties are in principle able to select a foreign law in Brazil, the contracting parties must comply with local public policy.   I strongly advise that two or more Brazilian parties contracting obligations in Brazil agree that the respective contract be governed by the laws of Brazil.With respect to the dispute resolution mechanism, we are all aware of Enron's policy to avoid referring disputes to the Brazilian courts.   In case of the above mentioned Elektro deal, the idea is to submit all contract controversies to arbitration under ICC rules in S?o Paulo.   To me, the question is whether we use \"ad hoc\" arbitration OR institutional arbitration (i.e. submit the matter to FIESP or the Canadian-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce to act as the \"arbitration administrator\").FYI since I joined Enron, I've been told that all of Enron's Brazilian entities should use foreign arbitration as their contracts' dispute resolution mechanism.   In my opinion, this concept may not work the way Enron wants.   If the local Enron entity is dealing with another Brazilian party and (suppose) both parties have agreed to use ICC arbitration in NY, it is most likely that, in case the Brazilian counterparty decides to refer the matter under dispute to the Brazilian courts, the local judge will accept jurisdiction and review the case.   You may ask \"why\".   The reason is because there are two Brazilian parties contracting obligations to be performed in Brazil under the laws of Brazil; as a consequence a local judge will accept jurisdiction.I'd very much like to emphasize that, while working as General Counsel of the Odebrecht Group, I use to accept foreign arbitration clauses in contracts entered with Affiliates of foreign companies because I knew that, at the end of the day, I could always challenge the dispute resolution mechanism agreed in the contract and refer the matter to the local courts.   Since Odebrecht's counterparties did not do their homework properly ...Arbitration was first introduced in Brazil through the Federal Constitution of 1824.   The Civil Code of 1916 ractified the use of arbitration, however, it obliged the arbitral award to be reviewed by the local courts.   Only in 19996, with the issuance of the Brazilian Arbitration Act (Law 9307), it was recognized the use of arbitration as a definitive dispute resolution mechanism without having to submit the final arbitral award to the review of the local courts.With respect to enforceability, please note that the arbitral award is final, binding and enforceable towards the contracting parties.   Only in case a Party decides not to comply with the final arbital award, the other Party may refer the arbitral award to a local judge to obtain an \"exequatur\".Please feel free to contact me at the earliest possible convenience to continue to discuss this arbitration matter.Rgds,SamiRobert C Williams@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT01/09/20001 03:555 PMTo: Michelle Blaine/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Sami Arap/SA/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Elektro's telecom project   There was a concern at one point that FIESP would favor big, \"homegrown\" companies.

The SPC will be named \"SP Telecom\".   SP Telecom will develop telecommunication services using the LDCs' infra-structure.   After SP Telecom's formation, an investor will be selected to purchase the majority of the company's shares.   Elektro will have a 5% participation in SP Telecom and this deal will generate approximately US$10MM in revenues for Elektro.The Parties have been discussing a draft MOU for several months, however, this matter came to my attention only a few weeks ago.   The MOU has been reviewed by all Parties and is currently on final rounds of negotiation.There is one pending issue which I need to discuss with you before I get Jim Derrick's sign-off.   CTEEP and EPTE (state and private owned LDCs) have requested that the MOU, as well as any other SP Telecom project agreement, includes a dispute resolution mechanism through the courts of S?o Paulo.   I have discussed this matter with Jose Margalith (Elektro's in-house counsel) and Randy Young, and have suggest Margalith to offer ICC arbitration at FIESP (the S?o Paulo State Industries Federation) as an alternative.Orlando Gonzalez asked me to assist him to resolve this pending issue at the earliest possible convenience.   Any thoughts or ideas ?   Please feel free to call me (555-111-55503-12226).Tks for your assistance to this matter.Sami Arap\n"

To take this=\r a=20\rstep further, one could argue that an employee who trades the equities of=\r=20\renergy companies for Enron should not trade energy company equities for his=\r=20\ror her own account but could trade other equities - if it were me, I would=\r=20\rcertainly make sure that Ted Murphy agreed with my analysis before I did it=\r. =20\rOf course, a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for=20\rpersonal trading - metals, ag commodities, bandwidth, freight, lumber, amon=\rg=20\rmany others - for all employees.

Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so.2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am aware of by separate email...I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on that draft, but nothing has been signed.3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the initial draft of the \"talking points\" for the disclosure discusison. It is new and has not been discussed internally yet.4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.   Kay Mann is handling the \"State\" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be.5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will depend upon the timing of the option vesting.   My gut reaction is that we will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.   I do not know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and again request Kay to please advise us on that.It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.

Policy on Noncompetition.   I would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.   Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron affiliates) by Monday, October 2.Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation portfolios into a single company (Newco).   Newco would be charged with making the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.   The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a \"dumping ground\" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation opportunities in Asia.   As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that would bind their respective affiliates.   The following is a summary of these competition provisions:Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first offering the opportunity to Newco.   If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties provided that the terms do not materially improve.   Development or ownership does not include the provision of construction, O&amp;M, offtaker or risk management services.There are a number of exceptions to this rule:   (a) small projects involving 20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; &amp;copy; projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and (f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition restriction.\"Affiliates\" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).\"Asia Pacific Region\" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).   It does not include Japan and Australia.The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 20003.Thank you,Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI\n"

AIG Declines to Pay Flashpoint Bonds, Triggers 18-Notch S&amp;P Cut2/8/1 13:3 (New York)AIG Declines to Pay Flashpoint Bonds, Triggers 18-Notch S&amp;P Cut   London, Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) --- A pair of ```AA'''-rated bondsissued by Flashpoint Ltd. suffered an 18-notch downgrade byStandard &amp; Poor's after a unit of American International GroupInc. said it won't pay on insurance that guarantees the bonds.   The $149.1 million of bonds, named Hollywood Funding No. 5.and No. 6, were sold by the U.K. company to finance films andtelevision shows. S&amp;P assigned its top rating to the securitiesbecause they're guaranteed by Lexington Insurance Co., asubsidiary of AIG, the world's largest insurer.   Investors who bought the zero-coupon bonds were to be repaidby the revenue from a basket of films. When the films didn't makeenough to cover those payments, the insurance policy was designedto kick in. Lexington, though, said it won't cover the shortfallbecause the film company broke its contract. Now, S&amp;P regards thebonds as ```vulnerable to nonpayment,''' and rates them ```CC-.'''   ```There has never been a downgrade of that magnitude inEurope,''' said Kurt Sampson, head of structured finance ratingsat S&amp;P. ```We are voicing our concern about the implications forthe capital markets. The degree of our concern is evident by thefact we are going public with this.'''   S&amp;P, which downgraded the Hollywood bonds on Friday, saidLexington's actions have prompted it to review other securitiesinsured by Lexington in case the insurer seeks to ```raisedefenses to the payment''' due on other bonds.   Joe Norton, AIG's spokesman, said the company won't commenton the bonds. Graham Johnson at Flagship Group, which handlespress communications for Flashpoint, said the company regards thebonds as ```not a matter that it's appropriate for them to commenton.''' Credit Suisse First Boston, which managed the private saleof Flashpoint's six Hollywood Funding bonds, also declined tocomment.   Cash Shortfall   Hollywood Funding No. 5, a $48.4 million dollar bond, wasdue to be repaid on Jan. 5, according to people familiar with thesecurity. Bondholders haven't been paid, and agreed to wait fortwo months before triggering a default because Lexington isinvestigating whether the issuer broke its contract with theinsurer, S&amp;P said.   ```The policies were to provide for sufficient funds to paythe notes in full, should revenues in the trustee's otheraccounts be insufficient,''' S&amp;P said. ```S&amp;P believed that theoriginal policies''' would pay out under any circumstances, ```andthat any such matters were not supposed to constitute a defenseto payment on the policies.'''   S&amp;P's defines ```AA''' ratings as those applying to issuerswith an ```extremely strong''' ability to meet their obligations.   The rating company also said that Lexington won't be meetingshortfalls on Hollywood Funding No. 6, a $1000.7 million bondmaturing on June 18, because the issuer broke its contract by notmaking as many films at it agreed to.---Alice James in the London newsroom (444) 207 3330 7195, orajames@bloomberg.net, with reporting by Sean Farrell /mgStory illustration: {HOLFUN 0 6/18/01 &lt;Corp&lt; DES &lt;GO&lt;} for theterms of one of the bonds.NI CRA   NI BON   NI EBN   NI ABS   NI INS   NI REDNI COR   NI FILM   NI TV   NI ENT   NI LAW   NI ENHNI EUB   NI PVT   NI WINAIG US &lt;Equity&lt; CN-0- (BN ) Feb/08/20001 18:03 GMT\n"

So, I=01%ve decided to write these few words. Certainly you =\rdo\rnot remember me as you meet lots of people everyday around the world. But I\rhad the pleasure of meeting you when I was attending a SAP training course\rin 2000 when I was in Houston.\rI worked for the Legal Departament in the Sao Paulo office and had been\rdeveloping a good job (at least my performance evaluations said so) when I\rwas said teh company was firing many people and I was included in the fatal\rlist. My immediate supervisors tried to do everything they could to keep me\rthere and all the answers were no.\rI want you to know that this message is not to complain about my firing.\rEveryone who works is subject to this fact, specially in Brazil. I simply\rbecame astonished when I was told that two people are being hired for the\rsame position I had less than 2 months after I left the company.\rSo, my question is WHY? Why and how does Enron commit such a mistake? I\rreally trusted the company I used to work for, I really enjoyed working for\rEnron and why? Why did Enron fired me and two months later started hiring\rtwo others for the same position? How can such a big company like Enron be\rso unreasonalble and why not to say insensitive?\r Sorry for this emotional words but I had to say that. I know you might not\reven   read this message but I had to try, specially because I did believe i=\rn\rRICE and I felt I had found out a company where the speech did correpond to\rthe action, but unfortunately...\r Thank you for giving me a little piece of your time and wish success for th=\re\rcompany because I still have friends working very hard there and they reall=\ry\rlike it as I did once.\r Thanks a lot for your attention.\rAna Cristina Carvalho dos Santos\rex- S?o Paulo office\remail: anacristina32@hotmail.com   ___\rGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com.   \n"

Until that is complete, however, Sami &amp; John have identified the following spot market contracts as needing immediate approval for dispute resolution clauses agreeing to ICC administered arbitration in Sao Paulo or Rio.   As you are aware, this is somewhat contrary to our traditional policy for out of country ICC arbitration.   The counter parties in these transactions will not agree to arbitration outside Brazil.   Given the nature of these contracts, I believe ICC administered arbitration in Brazil is an acceptable means for dispute resolution.   I've discussed this with Rob and he is in agreement subject to your approval.Regards,MichelleFrom:   Arap, Sami [mailto:IMCEAEX-_O=ENRON_OU=NA_CN=RECIPIENTS_CN=NOTESADDR_CN=8DA5AE3C-E63010333-862568E0-To: Subject: arbitration for Brazilian PPAsImportance: HighMichelle;Our commercial guys are negotiating a number of PPAs in Brazil (spot market deals) and we need to close these deals before the Brazilian Wholesale Power Market (MAE) starts accounting and settling the long &amp; short differences among all players (LDC's, Genco's, marketers etc).   There are deals which were \"closed\" last year (\"closing\" meaning that price, MWh volume, term, power profile, center of gravity etc were agreed upon between the contracting entities).   Some of these MWh's have already been physically traded but MAE haven't yet calculated the system's settlement.Karla and I are currently working on the below listed deals:Moema-2: 10-year PPA to purchase 8MW; PV of apprx US$5,130,000.; MTM value of US$1,2000,000.Sgu?rio: 2-year PPA to purchase 0.5MW; TBDFurnas Collar: 2-year PPA to purchase 20-90-130MW (collar concept); PV of apprx US$37,696,000.; MTM value of US$12,534,000.Cofepar: 15-year term to purchase 2000MW; PV of apprx US$171,014,000.; MTM to be defined.CSN: 14-month PPA to purchase 13.4MW (10,000MWh/month); PV of apprx US$5,865,000.; MTM value of US$786,000.Eletropaulo Metropolitana: 60-day PPA to purchase 7,000MWh/month; TBDGerasul/Pactual: 24-month PPA to purchase 29,57MW; PV of apprx US$19,096,000.; MTM value of US$4,235,000.CEMAT/Pactual: 13-month PPA to purchase 46MW; PV of apprx US$12,201,000.; MTM value of 6,107,000.Celtins: 30-day PPA to sell 80MWh during peak hours; TBDCemat: 30-day PPA to sell 950MWh during off-peak hours; TBDSINOP:   10-month PPA to purchase 8MW; PV of apprx US$8,850,000; MTM value of US$1,723,000.AES Sul:   4-month PPA to purchase 333,6MW; PV of apprx US$2,470,000.; MTM value of US$8666,000.We are not (yet) working under \"umbrella\" type of agreements where Enron and the counterparty will execute a General Terms and Conditions (GTC) with several Annexes, each of them related to a specific deal.   Each contract is to be treated as one single deal. Some of the above listed deals are 1QTR commercial priorities and I need to know if you would be OK with Enron's Marketing Co (ECE) using ICC-administered or FIESP-administered (as a second alternative) arbitration under ICC Rules in S?o Paulo as the PPA's dispute resolution mechanism.   Although I am schedule to meet with Tozzini, Freire this week, I doubt I will have time to get their legal opinion, discuss it internally, prepare a recommendation to Jim Derrick etc etc.   I've already talked to some of the counterparty's in-house counsellors and none of them is willing to accept offshore arbitration.   Our counterparties' position has been arbitration in Brazil under int'l rules OR local courts. Rgds,Sami\n"

We exchanged 2 drafts of a Letter Agreement which says ENA (or an affiliate) will buy their 999% LP interest in Landfill Gas Investments, LP (LGI) on or before Jan 31, 20001.   Included in our draft was a provision whereby the ENE Guaranty would be extinguished.   However, late yesterday Fidelity came back and said they're not willing to extinguish the Guaranty completely.   The way the deal w/ Fidelity will be structured, ENA will pay them the delta between the $5.2MM initial payment they made less the accrued tax credits on the date we close (est to be $3000K+/-).   Fidelity wants 2 things:protection in the event the IRS disallows/disqualifies the tax credits accrued (i.e., the $3000K), andprotection against any environmental claims that may have occurred while they were a partner in LGI (June, 2000 thru Jan, 20001).There are 2 basic alternatives to consider:replace the existing guaranty to LGI with a new guaranty to Fidelity with a specific cap on the tax credit amount ($3000K+/-) and with the same environmental coverage (up to $5MM) as currently exists but restricting it to issues which occurred while they were a partner.   The probability of either ever being triggered is extremely remote.   Replacing the benefactor from LGI to Fidelity is significant for us because it eliminates future environmental exposure related to LGI as well as prevents potential future buyers of our LP interest from seeing that ENE once was willing to issue such a guaranty.replace the existing guaranty with an indemnity from ENA which provides Fidelity with the same protection as alternative #1.   Per ENA accounting since the amount of exposure is limited to $5.3MM in aggregate, this would not be significant/material enough to be separately identified as a balance sheet item.The problem we have is Fidelity has a Guaranty \"in hand\" and unless you give me approval to go back and structure our deal around them, we don't have any leverage to get them to release it.   They are willing to work with us on either of the 2 alternatives listed above.   This is the only remaining commercial issue left w/ Fidelity.Please advise or call to discuss further.   Ext. 333212.   Thanks!RANDY\n"

In addition to any positive results for the foreign institutions from these operations, the spread, commissions, premiums, and other related sums. when remitted abroad, will not be subject to any income tax withholdings.   With respect to the tax treatment of losses that Brazilian companies may incur as a result of hedging operations, such losses may be deductible for the purpose of determining taxable profits, only in the event that they occur in investments on exchanges abroad.   If these transactions are not carried out on such exchanges, the losses will not be deductible when determining the taxable profits.Brazilian entities are not prevented to enter into swap or other derivative transactions on the international market in case they do not meet the requirements established above.   The consequences, however, will be the following:payments and receipts arising from such transactions as well as remittances to or from abroad inherent to these transactions could not be effected in foreign currency upon prompt closing of exchange on the commercial exchange market, but only through mechanisms available in the or related to the floating (or \"tourism\") exchange rate;the inflow of foreign currency through the floating rate market would be subject to IOF (tax on financial transactions) assessed at the rate of 2% on the Brazilian currency equivalent of the foreign funds entering Brazil;remittance of any amounts that are considered income of a foreign resident shall be subject to withholding income tax at 15% or at a reduced rate if the creditor is domiciled in a country   with which Brazil has entered into a double taxation treaty .To the best of my knowledge, you will appreciate that the ISDA Master Agreement has been widely used by foreign swap dealers with Brazilian counterparties.Rgds,SamiFrom: Mark E Haedicke@ECT on 04/111/20001 02:47 PM CDTTo: Sami Arap/SA/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Re: Financial Trading in Brazil   Sami:   What is the net net of the new policy?\tSami Arap@ENRON\t04/10/20001 03:36 PM \t\t\t To: Brent Hendry/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Financial Trading in Brazil   - CHAR5.DOC - M2689II.DOC\n"

As a suggestion you might want to allocate these questions, or any others to be asked to your direct reports at your regular meeting on Monday and where necessary they can provide you with any particular details to give as full an answer as you would like. Janette could possibly ask question numbered 1. Let me know if there is anything you would like me to do. I will of course be happy to ask any question, provided you have had the opportunity to prepare an answer. Regards, Marcus1.When will EWS Legal Department be moving to the new building and where will we be located? 2.Will all attorneys have an office?3.While we expect all areas of the EWS business to grow, which areas , over the next 6-12 months, do you believe will grow the fastest and require the greatest support from the EWS Legal Department?4.With the bankruptcy of PG&amp;E what were we able to do using our existing contracts to mitigate our exposure?5.Are there any changes that you believe we will need to make to our contracts or any new contracts we will need to consider entering into with counterparties to assist us in managing our risk in the event of future bankruptcies? 6. Are you able to tell us what we estimate financial our exposure is to PG&amp;E as a result of their bankruptcy?7.Why is Enron winding down its power trading operations in Japan?   \n"

The reason is I am working with a very successful LBO firm of medium size by French standards.   The project is in the process of being defined, but it is essentially a web site that brings together a number of elements of the energy field including electricity, gas and petroleum.   I would like to find out what the Enron person thinks is available and what is not available that would be useful.   It might be that Enron would want to participate in some fashion eventually, but the contact would not be about that.   It does not matter if it is an English or a French speaker.   Perhaps they run their presumably modest operation out of some other place like London.   I would be happy to go wherever the person is.   By the way, did you see the article in this week's EUW that says there is going to be an electricity trading market in France starting in May?   Because of EDF's expansion ambitions elsewhere especially in Europe they are beginning to get serious about opening up the market here.   Regards. Doug\n"

You may be getting a call from JoAnne Pinkettregarding a proposal for future funding of the BEAR program.   There hasapparently been some difficulty in communication between the BEAR board andour board.   Any proposal has to make its way through the Children's Services Committeethen the Executive Committee.   It is then put before the whole board for avote.   I thought that you would be an idea person to advise the BEARrepresentatives as to how to structure the proposal to the Children'sCommittee to ensure that it is given a fair and expeditious review anddecision - a proposal that would be comprehensible to board members who arenot directly involved with the BEAR program.   I also thought you could givethis advice without having to commit a great deal of time (including traveltime for meetings).I think everyone agrees that it is a great program and that we should besupportive of such public-private partnerships.   There is probably somedifference of opinion amongst the board as to how much support (and at whatpace) we should give the program.   I would deeply appreciate your helpingthe BEAR folks make the clearest proposal possible.   I, for one, want thisprogram to succeed.   As good as its current work is - I think it holds evengreater potential for benefiting the children we serve.Thanks for your help,ErnestErnest Frug,,, Ph.D.Assistant Professor   Department of Pediatrics   Department of Family &amp; Community Medicine   Baylor College of MedicineDirector of Psychosocial Programs   Texas Children's Cancer Center   66621 Fannin St., MC 3-320, Houston, Texas 777030 USAEmail: efruge@bcm.tmc.edu   Phone: 832-824-42000\n"

His name is Takuro Shioda and he has been working on the commercial side with Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, with whom we are currently negotiating an ISDA master.The ISDA people here are trying generally to get more non-legal non-documentary   trading types involved in the Japanese language committees because of how valuable this sort of feedback is in terms of practical application of the ISDA docs and they have indicated that they would be particularly   grateful for help from Enron in this regard.None of our Japanese traders have any real ISDA experience but I have taken this as a first step.   We cant do much more for ISDA on this front at this point in time but obviously as we put ISDA masters in place and trade under them this situation will change.Jane\n"

This is something that Kim Theriot's group can help us with.Meet with our   fundamentals leader and our head scheduler to try to understand as much as we can about how   shortage scenarios might unfold and what power flow behavior at the key delivery points might look like.   Meet with Steve Walters of Stoel Rives to get his mind focussed on big picture early positioning moves we might wish to take with BPA.Get Marcus Wood to help us refine our understanding of BPA Surplus firm and Excess Federal Power and how BPA might reasonably be expected to act with respect to each.Get credit to figure out if there is anyway we can get BPA to post a large amount of LC collateral to us.   ---cgy\n"

For what it is worth, outside counsel does have some concerns with just arbitrating the confidentiality issue. First, they raise the possibility that by only raising the confidentiality issue, we might be waiving the guaranty assignability issue. To try to prevent this argument, you will note that we have put preservation language in the arbitration statement of claim.   We will need to do some additional legal research to make sure that would do the trick.   Second, outside counsel tends to think the two claims together (confidentiality and the guarantee assignability) work better together.   Let's talk soon. - Letter to Timothy D. Bourn.DOC\n"

Status update on court proceedings;2.   Evidentiary matters, including:(a)   formal industry support for our position - without it, we are fighting an uphill battle, and I understand the other side will be filing evidence of industry support for their position; and (b)   a detailed and focused analysis of the pre-NGX and post-NGX index consequences, in terms of volume and pricing consequences - our analysis to date has proven weak;3.   Goals, including can we live with the risk of no CGPR AECO index.   In other words, our best argument is likely that CGPR cannot pass off what it purports to be an AECO index reflecting the broader market, but NGX (and EOL for that matter) are free to publish their own index.   The result might be that NGX (or EOL for that matter) is free to publish their own index, provided it is not passed of as being the CGPR AECO index reflecting the broader market, and Enerdata then must publish the broader index, if it wishes, as the CGPR AECO index.   However, if CGPR chose not to continue publishing, it is likely going to be free to do so, with the effect that there would be no CGPR AECO index as referred to in our Confirms and Transactions, which would have to then be altered to account for a separate and new index, which for the time being could be NGX or EOL.I have asked our outside lawyers to join in on the call at 2:000 p.m. (Calgary time) tomorrow.Peter \n"

We will be managing the position under an incentive fee arrangement, as well as providing back-office operations for sheduling, dispatch, settlement, etc.   I understand that commercially this was something we wanted to win badly.   Chris did a wonderful job together with our commercial people (involving some very late nights) to put together an excellent response to the RFP, which was deatiled in identifying and managing the risks.   I understand that although our response was to the RFP was therefore non-comforming, it showed such a detailed thought and understanding of the issues that we were awarded the contract with all of our conditions accepted.   Everyone here is very pleased.   We now need to develop the definitive agreement with Ontario, which I will help Chris on due to the many demands on his time.   At this time I am hoping to try to avoid using external counsel.   If we need to use external counsel, I will speak to you regarding an appropriate firm.Peter.\n"

Sorry for the long memo but it might make our discussion more efficient.I wanted to see if I could recruit someone with 4-6 years major law firm experience and whom I knew or could confirm by my contacts as having a reputation as a quality lawyer and person with broad corporate and commercial experience.   Perhaps I am getting too far removed from that level, but I was able to come up with only one candidate that I think is worthy of pursuing.   If he proves unsatisfactory, I will then have to go to an out-placement/recruitment agency, which is relatively expensive.   That said the candidate I am suggesting would to my mind be as good or better than any candidate that we may find through a formal recruitment process.   His name is Derek Flaman.   I will send his resume to you by fax.A couple of points:Strengths:(a)   Derek comes from the Donahue Ernst and Young firm and to my knowledge is a highly regarded commercial associate.(b)   Prior to that he was at Macleod Dixon and a highly regarded commercial associate there.   The Managing Partner of Donahue Ernst and Young Calgary came from Macleod Dixon Calgary and brought Derek over with him.&amp;copy;   Derek has never done any work for us, but I have met him socially a number of times and have spoken to him about this job possibility.   I think he has a down-to-earth and comfortable personality that would suit the atmosphere and stresses of Enron well.(d)   Derek was seconded internally to Husky Oil - one of DEY's major Calgary clients - for a period and has experince in-house.   He worked for an internal lawyer at Husky who is a friend of Greg Johnston and who gave excellent reviews.(e)   Although I do not have his law school grades, he tells me he finished in the top third of his class at Queens University - which among the reputable schools in Canada.(f)   He is qualified both under Alberta and Ontario law.(g)   He has met with Milnthorp and Greg Johnston, both of whom were favorably impressed.Issues:(a)   Derek graduated from law school in '94 and since that time his career has been a bit traveled.   Although there is an explanation, his continuous experience at Macleod Dixon and Donahue Ernst and Young started in '97.   Before that the history is he is from a small town in Alberta.   After graduating he wanted to work at a small firm in Toronto and had an interest in labor law, and spent his first year articling to a Toronto labor boutique.   After that year he wanted to get into commercial work and out Toronto, and moved to Fraser Milner in Edmonton.   His wife then took a position at Stikeman Elliott in Calgary however, and so he moved to Macleod Dixon in Calgary.   He moved to Donahue Ernst and Young when they established their office in Calgary.   All things being considered, I am comfortable with his experience at say a 4 to 5 year level - although compensation could then be an issue (I have not discussed compensation with him).(b)   Derek's experience has been primarily in large commercial projects, especially the off-shore oil and gas developments in Hibernia and Terra Nova for Husky.   This would require some very good legal and large project organizational skills but is obviously different from a faster paced, commercially oriented, higher volume trading atmosphere.   In his secondment to Husky however he was more involved in their retail gasoline business and natural gas marketing and,   although I am sure not the atmosphere at Enron, he tells me it is an atmosphere he is comfortable with and enjoys.&amp;copy;   Do Jim Derrick's accounting/law firm concerns apply to hiring a lawyer (as opposed to retaining counse)?I would like to get back to Derek soon to discuss next steps (interview in Houston? with whom? Vicki Sharp? get a feel for compensation expectations?), or look to other alternatives.Peter.\n"

No.If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy?   Given the limited physical presence of EGM in foreign locations, I would not expect implementation to be a problem.Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?   The commitment under the \"Consultation and Advice\" section of the statement on \"Interactions between Companies and Public Security\" provides: \"In their consultations with host governments, Companies should take all appropriate measures to promote adherence to international law enforcement standards, particularly those reflected in the U.N. Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms.\"   I believe we should take note that \"all appropriate measures\" is very broad and could publicly be construed to mean an obligation to withdraw our operations from a particular country that fails to abide by these principles.My response pertains only to the operations of Enron Global Markets.   I will be checking my emails while I am in Singapore and will be happy to address this further if you would like me to do so.

These have been worked out over the past several months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and Foreign Secretary Cook.   As a result, we really don't   have the ability to change the text, which is fixed. As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these issues are of primary concern.   (I am separately collecting comments/concerns from within EES and EECC.)The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be implemented by Enron.   We as the legal department have been asked to express our view on are the following:(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly express its \"endorsement\" of these polices?(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in implementing the policy?&amp;copy; Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get our feed back to Lauren by November 8 (Thursday).)You cane-mail your comments or phone them to   me at 713-646-6309. If I get suffucient expressions of interest for a conference call by Monday, I will set up a call in number for Wednesday morning US. Thanks, I appreciate your views and comments. ---",

I wasn't sure if you were suggesting the policy for trading contracts or all contracts of greater than a year.My thoughts are as follows:1) Policy Scope: I think we need to address whether the Policy will extend to trading as well as origination transactions. As you know, often there is a very blurry line.2) Existing Masters: If a master is in place, confirmations will be used for terms of one month to greater than one year. I don't think it will be practical for us to approve these confirmations before signature unless there are material modifications done to the pre-approved confirmation template in the master, which would require Legal approval in the present state of affairs.   I assume the Policy would only apply to individually negotiated contracts outside a Master Agreement.3) Order of Magnitude: We should consider having a dollar figure (determined simply by multiplying the notional or contract volume x the contract price or the Enron financial commitment amount), coupled with the one year or greater term, that would require the additional OGC/AGC approval in order to make sure the requirement is imposed only for higher dollar contracts.I would be happy to discuss this with you further.Alan\n"

Ontario's electricity sector was failing us.Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third highest in Canada. The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done.That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that:The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the electricity market to competition will exist by May 20002. The government is committed to an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and reliable supply.There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive markets are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and benefit consumers. There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to ensure the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are committed to opening the market at the earliest possible date, while ensuring all of the conditions required for a smooth transition to competition are met.And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 20002.First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to the lowest possible costs and better service for all. Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current needs. Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater certainty to potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion dollars in new generation projects. Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity sector. They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the province's environmental assessment process.And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they want, including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help promote the demand for cleaner, greener electricity. And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity sector will open by May 20002.

Of course we would have been much happier with an outside date or target of November 1, 20001 or   an unconditional May 1, 20002 date; however, it at least shows a commitment to deregulation. While Enron Toronto will be busy with ongoing marketing and certain major projects in the near future (the OEFC NUG Contract Management Agreement, the G6 retail initiative and the ENERconnect amendment),   the obvious umber one priority of this office in the short term will be negotiating an extension to the British Energy Supply Contract.Regards CJG---"

These meetings are mandatory for all Director and equivalent level staff within the organisation across all Enron companies in Australia.   The meetings will be held in the boardroom at 4.30PM on each Monday (or Tuesday in case of holiday).   Accordingly, I encourage you to avoid scheduling any conflicts with this timing.The first meeting will be held on Monday 30 October.David Minns will play a central role to the coordination of the commercial activities of this group.   Please supply David with a list of your group's major deal initiatives should you intend to be absent from this meeting.   In David's absence please provide me with this list should you be unable to attend this meeting in person or not be in a position to dial in to the meeting. In addition, Heidi Mason will assume greater responsibility for coordinating support resources throughout office.   All administrative staff will report to Heidi in addition to their current direct report.The assumption of greater coordinating responsibility for David and Heidi is designed to maximise the amount of effort each Director is expending on direct commercial activities as well as increasing efforts to maximise existing resources and cross-commodity deal opportunities.A general office email will be sent advising of this initiative.   This email will also incorporate explicit comment on reporting and expense obligations.   Your cooperation in supporting this initiative is appreciated.\n"

As background, it was understood at the time we took Carlos on board that his long term career interests were not limited to our construction work, and, consistent with his resume, I have kept him mostly focused on our equity and finance related matters (including work-outs).

As background, I have been at EECC since October last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financing agreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategic investment transactions.   Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houston office of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &amp; Mosle)   where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.   Lastly, I started my legal career in 19994 at Patton Boggs in Washington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m &amp; a work, and securities offerings.   Thanks for your consideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return from vacation (my extension is 6-6127).   \n"

I am involved with a potential power plant development project with the Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida.   The project would be on their land and would potentially involve a joint venture with them.   Although we are at a preliminary stage, even the initial letter of intent that we are negotiating raises unique issues that will set the precedent for our project development agreements with respect to enforceability, jurisdiction and dispute resolution matters.   I have identified and spoken with Lynn Slade of the New Mexico law firm of Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris &amp; Sisk on whether he could advise us on the Indian law issues associated with this project.   Lynn and several of his colleagues specialize on Indian law matters, and Lynn has experience both with representing Enron and in handling energy transactions in general.   In fact, Lynn gave a presentation at the 1999 Enron law conference entitled \"Energy Business in 'Indian Country': Opportunities and Obstacles\" (credit goes to Jeff Hodge for remembering that presentation and suggesting I contact Lynn); Lynn has represented several of Enron's pipeline companies, as well as the government affairs department, in connection with their Indian law issues and, at one time, prepared an opinion letter for ENA in a transaction involving the Ute tribe.   Lastly, please note that I had asked our Florida counsel of Greenberg Trauig on whether they had any Indian law expertise, including specifically, any experience involving the Seminoles.   Unfortunately, the Seminoles are one of their clients so Greenberg cannot represent us in a manner adverse to the Tribe.   Thanks in advance for your attention and consideration of this request.Carlos Sole'Senior CounselEnron North America Corp.14000 Smith StreetHouston, Texas 7770002-7361(713) 345-8191 (phone)(713) 646-33393 (fax)\n"

(i.e. All physical transactions, Confirms, GTC's, Masters, etc. are documented out of Calgary, all with the proper controls.)   Honestly, I am not clear on this point.   My understanding is that responsibility for financial trading for Canada is with Mark Taylor.   i.e. I understand that Confirms which do not require legal input have been moved to the Confirm group in Calgary, but Confirms which require legal input, ISDA Masters with Canadian counterparties, structured financial transactions, etc. remain with Mark Taylor, and that Calgary Legal is not, generally speaking, responsible for financial transactions.   I do not want to re-visit this issue, but merely clarify any confusion so that I can get back to Milnthorp.

The bid qualification documentation needs to be in Friday and US Thanksgiving is Thursday/Friday.   I wanted you to be aware of this, and determine from you if any corporate approvals need to be obtained.Firstly, Derek Davies/John Zufferli will only be bidding to the extent authorized by Lavo.Secondly, bid qualification commits us to the rules of the auction, the forms of documentation to govern both the auction and the purchase if we are successful, and requires a bid deposit (approximately C$6.5MM), but does not obligate us to bid and, provided we comply with the auction rules, the Bid Deposit will be returned after the auction.Thirdly, unlike the PPA auction the risks are much less significant in terms of volume and term.   In terms of documentation, if we are the successful bidder, we will be buying power from the Balancing Pool under a physical Master, which seems to be a Canadianized version of the EEI Master and which, although not entirely to our liking, is generally satisfactory.Fourthly, the position will, I understand, be managed in the power trading book within approved position limits.   Note:   The nominal amounts owing (i.e. no up front payment is required) on an unhedged basis for the entire 3000MWs in year #1 would be something like C$260MM, assuming a C$1000/MW purchase price.   Year #2 would be C$1114MM and year #3 would be C$57MM.Given the nature of the transaction, the short time that we have with US Thanksgiving intervening, and numerous other demands, I do not believe that a DASH, Risk Memo and/or Board Approval is necessary, but please let me know.I will leave you a brief voice mail to follow-up.Peter.\n"

In terms of a risk memo, I agree that one should not be necessary as in many respects this can be characterized as normal course trading within position limits under a standardized Master Agreement and without an outlay of capital, but hopefully the following (together with my memo from last night - copy attached) suffices to the extent a risk memo is required.In terms of unusual risks:1.   We do not have any rights to collateral under the proposed Master.   However, the counterparty is the Balancing Pool which is essentially Government of Alberta credit risk.   Derek Davies is I believe dealing with Credit to resolve credit issues.   In fact, I believe the Balancing Pool is taking significant risk as it is selling the power firm under a Master which does not match up to the interruptible nature of the PPAs it holds.2.   The Balancing Pool will be secured under the Master by a parental guarantee of Enron Corp. and has a somewhat discretionary right to call for collateral from us under the Master if there is a material change in Enron Corp.'s creditworthiness.3.   It is a requirement of the auction that we will have entered into back-to-back physical hedges for 70% of the volume we acquire, and we are currently working at putting those deals in place conditional on us bidding and being successful in the auction.   Penalties can be imposed if 70% of the volume purchased is not properly hedged.4.   As we are dealing with the Government of Alberta, we always run the risk (as we are somewhat seeing now with respect to the Sundance PPA we acquired in the first auction) that they can change the auction rules, the market rules or the legislation in ways that are adverse to us.   In terms of the auction rules, as with the first auction, they could be better drafted, but our fundamental concern will be to make sure that it is clear that if we post a bid deposit and do not bid that we get the deposit back, and to ensure that the rules are clear enough that we are comfortable that we are in complete control of whether or not we can comply with the rules.Peter.(Milly, sorry for not copying you on my first memo - see below.)---"

The reason I ask is that I am going to be involved in the industry push here in Ontario to develop a standard physical bilateral agreement.   While it is my understanding that many participants want to start with the EEI form and OPGI believes that they already have a next to final form, for obvious reasons Peter and Milly would like to see our form become the industry standard.Another thing that would be helpful is a brief memo describing the differences between the EEI form and our form and the rationale for the differences.   Some of this may be readily apparent from running a blackline, but I would like to have the benefit of the knowledge you have built up in developing the form.   Timing of this is fairly tight as the next meeting on this initiative is November 9th.   My goal is to show up at the meeting and advocate a \"Canadianized\" version of the EEI form and then describe the great time and effort Enron has expended on this already and table our draft as a starting point.Apparently EEI will also be in attendance.   I will follow up with Elizabeth Sager on what is the status of our relationship with EEI and what was the US experience in developing the EEI master.RegardsCJG\n"

He said he would check with Reliant to ensure there were no conflicts.   When he returned my call, Reliant was unwilling to permit LaBeouf to proceed on our behalf.   Because I had been told earlier this year that Reliant would probably never be opposed to   us anywhere but Texas in the future, I called a contact at Reliant who referred me to Mike Jines in the general counsel's office.   Mr. Jines was unavailable, so I left him a voicemail message.   I told him that as I understood it, Reliant is only in the generation business in CA and not in the retail sales of electricity as we are.   We should both be interested in options that create better markets, lift rate caps and foment competition.   Consequently, I felt there was no conflict here.   It took Mr. Jines some days to respond.   The intervention date was quickly approaching and needed legal assistance, I turned to Arter Hadden.   Some time after we had made that commitment (and after the intervention date), Mr. Jines called and suggested that perhaps something could be worked out.   Due to the press of other business, I did not return the call as the immediate situation had been resolved.In October then, as we searched for a lobby firm in Sacramento, one person who was highly recommended told us Reliant would be \"extremely uncomfortable\" if she were to represent us, too.   She opted not to interview with us.   Since the message was similar to the original message to LaBeouf, I have moved on to find another lobbyist and have not followed up with Jines.If you would like to discuss this more, please call.\n"

As you know, the Caledonia facility is currently scheduled to be sold to Cinergy Capital &amp; Trading, Inc.   The anticipated closing date is March 27, 20001 (but this is subject to change depending on when we obtain the requisite regulatory approval).One of the things that ENA was seeking to do, prior to deciding to sell the plant, was to establish a second interconnection to the Southern Company (currently Caledonia is interconnected to TVA).   In pursuit of this second interconnection, certain ENA developers were charged with the responsibility for obtaining options for easements.   The easements were needed in order to run the transmission wires from the plant to the point of the interconnection with Southern.   To date, we have obtained all but one of the required options (the \"Galiano Option\").We are obligated to cooperate with Cinergy from now until the closing date in pursuit of the Galiano Option.   Ms. Galiano and her lawyer have insisted upon adding an indemnity in the form of easement which requires the grantee (Caledonia Power I, LLC) to indemnify the grantor against liabilities arising from grantee's use of the easement.   They have adamantly rejected, however, my request that the indemnification be limited to actual damages (and that special, consequential and punitive damages be waived).   Cinergy has asked us to execute the Galiano Option without the waiver of consequential damages and I am seeking your permission to do so.I think that this should be acceptable from ENA's perspective for several reasons:1)   It is likely (999%+) that we sell Caledonia Power I, LLC (the proposed counterparty to the Galiano Option) in the next several weeks;2)   The Galiano Option is structured as an option to obtain an easement and the waiver of consequential damages issue only arises if the option is actually exercised; and 3)   If for some odd reason the sale doesn't go through, we finally decide to complete the second interconnection and we exercise the option for easement, we can probably mitigate our risk by procuring additional insurance.Please let me know, at your earliest possible convenience, if I may proceed with the execution of the Galiano Option.   Many thanks.Stuart\n"

We hope to have a recommendation shortly on an action plan for the regulatory compliance requirements, a recommendation on contracting forms (separate commercial and residential consumer forms) and to begin drafting forms.However, as discussed, outside counsel legal support will be required (i) to set up/register the retail entity to do business (subject to confirmation of the outstanding structuring issue, on which I await an answer); (ii) confirm all regulatory/statutory/licensing requirements for a retail affiliate; (ii) review and advise on contracting forms; and (iv) take an advocacy position for us at upcoming regulatory hearings.   In this regard we had agreed to talk to Stikeman Elliott about representation.   It turns out the Stikemans has an unresolveable conflict, as it acts for Enmax, the City of Calgary's retail affiliate and a direct competitor.   From asking around, it also seems that any of the firms which have/may have experience in the developing retail market, have acquired that experience for a client that would put them in direct conflict as well (ex. Bennet Jones - Atco/Canadian Utilities;   Macleod Dixon and McCarthy Tetrault - TransAlta;   Burnet Duckworth - City of Calgary/Enmax/City of Medicine Hat;   Borden Ladner Gervais - EPCOR), many of whom we have no experience in dealing with in any event.   It seems to me that the available alternatives are Blake Cassels &amp; Graydon and Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt, neither of whom to my specific knowledge have specific expertise in this area.   However, as noted, those with any actual (or purported) expertise tend for that reason to be conflicted.   Accordingly, my suggestion is that I speak to Blakes to see what expertise they have, but likely nonetheless retain them (assuming there is no conflict) on the basis of their general capabilities and their understanding and commitment to Enron.   At the end of the day, even if there is a learning curve, it is seemingly learnable and inevitable.   Please let me know if you have a problem, as we need to move quickly to get on with the project.To confirm, you were going to let me know how we should proceed with structuring the affiliate (liability vs. tax efficiency), which may be affected by how and if EES participates.Once the ball is rolling on the Alberta electricity front, we will re-focus on gas and other jurisdictions, such as Ontario.Regards, Peter.\n"

ENA/EEES issues.   I have not been involved so I don't know where it is at.   As request by Dave P., Mark P. has sent a copy of his preliminary issues memo to Vicki S.   2.   Market Achievement Plan for unsold PPAs.   The Government is expected to announce October 31st.   This will impact the market in many aspects, including the viability of competitive retail market options v. regulated rate options.   3.   We have proposals from two law firms.   Donahue Ernst &amp; Young and Blakes.   My preference would be DEY for diversification reasons, but DEY may have unresolvable conflicts which I would have to discuss with you if we are to proceed.   Blakes proposal may also have significant conflicts, which may be resolvable but which may limit the effectiveness of their representation.   Nonetheless, it seems a decision will not need to be made until the end of October.   In the meantime, Mark P. is working on scoping out legal and compliance issues, as well as forms.Peter.\n"

I did note that there were 4 categories for low risk jurisdictions, and only 3 categories for each of medium and high risk jurisdictions.   Maybe we cannot have a \"no legal\" risk in a high risk jurisdiction; but what about \"many significant\" legal issues in a medium risk jurisdiction?   Is this then too many categories?   Also, would it make any sense to have ratings of 1 through 4 only, with a requirement to specify whether we are dealing with a low, medium or high risk jurisdiction?   In other words, could anyone be confused into believing that   a rating of 4 is better than a rating of a 5?   As currently set forth, a higher rating does not necessarily equate to a greater risk.   Unless a reader were very familiar with the rating scale, someone might interpret a low number, out of say 10, as having minimal risk, when ratings 4, 7 and 10 may actually be the \"worst\".As for the OGC and Legal Committee:   I note only that Dan and Lisa would no longer be on the LC.   How do you think we would convey this to them?   Also, I was understanding that Stuart would start to be included.   I have also been asked recently where Randy Young technically fits within the system.   He is on the OGC, but I am still confused where he is technically on some organization chart.   Thanks.

(I heard on the radio this morning that Hakeem may beback.)   So the Rockets have sent out invoices for playoff tickets.   We are supposedto respond by this Friday, March 30. This year (perhaps because they know there's a decent chance they won't makethe playoffs) the Rockets are invoicing playoff tickets in two installments.The first installment covers rounds one and two, and the second covers theWestern Conference Finals and the NBA Championship. I can't tell whether if you commit for the first two rounds you have a legalobligation to buy the second and third if they make it to the WesternConference Finals, but I assume that doesn't matter (we should assume that acommitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs). Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games.   $549 per seat, or $2,196 total.   That'stwo games in Round 1 at $888.50 per ticket, and four games in Round 2 at$93.000 per ticket. Rounds 3 and 4 (which we wouldn't have to pay for until later) are $916 perseat, or $3,6664.   I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games. For the regular season I had 6/444 of the tickets, which is 13.6%.   That'sapproximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4.I'd be glad to spring for that, although if you all want all the playofftickets that's fine also. So I suppose how much it's going to cost each of you depends on whether myticket is Round 1 or 2.   If it's in round 2 each of you would pay $912 forthe first two rounds, and if it's in round 1 each of you would pay $921.   Ifthe two of you want all the playoff tickets, each of you would pay $1,098for Rounds 1 and 2. This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you canask for a refund by the same means that you paid.   So what I would proposeto do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don't make theplayoffs that charge will be reversed; and it may not even make it on mybill if they don't make the playoffs. Since I will put it on my card I won't need your money until about the 20thof April. So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to takea ticket out of each of the sets of rounds. (I'm fine either way)   Robert S. Baird Vinson &amp; Elkins L.L.P.

My thought is to insert a clause in our Master Agreements in the nature of a \"floating charge\".The problem with this concept is that it may be resisted within the industry.   For example, certain counterparties, i.e. a financial institution or a near-financial institution, such as a bank, a brokerage, a trading institution, etc., would not likely be willing to provide us with security over their assets.   In general, counterparties will also have concerns with granting security over their assets, particularly as that security may have restricting consequences for their treasury/banking relationships and covenants, and/or on their ability to conduct business, including disposing of assets which may then require our consent.   In addition, it would likely be necessary to introduce this concept on a bilateral basis, such that it would also be binding on us in similar circumstances.   (Counterparties could go so far as requiring this concept in our Enron Corp. guarantees.)For example, in the natural gas business in Canada at least, older form marketing agreements and agreements used by gas aggregators with gas producers used \"reserved dedication\" covenants, whereby reserves were dedicated to a particular contract.   These covenants did not, however, create security, to avoid the complicating issues addressed above.   To the extent that the reserves were not available, the marketer/aggregator could have a claim, on an unsecured basis, for breach of covenant, but was not in a secured position.   I do not believe we want to go to this type of concept.However, we may be able to think of some creative way whereby the counterparty is free to deal with us (and we are free to deal with them) on an unsecured basis, subject to our standard collateralization requirements, but also provide that upon the occurrence of a particularly serious event, such as a Material Adverse Change, a Triggering Event, an Event of Default, etc., the security automatically takes place.   We would need to consider whether such a \"prospective\" security interest could be made to work and be enforceable.I have discussed this concept on a preliminary basis with Rob Milnthorp and Mungo Hardwicke-Brown of the Blake firm to see if we could create a relatively simple clause to be inserted into our Master Agreements which artfully deals with this issue.   In essence, the idea would be to get ourselves in a position of being one step ahead of all of the unsecured creditors in the event there is an insolvency.Would you please let me know whether you think this is a worthwhile project or whether we have considered such a thing in the past in Houston.   As noted above, the clause would have to be one that could be \"sold\" to counterparties and be acceptable to us on a bilateral basis (and that may well not be possible).   If you believe that it is a worthwhile project, I will continue to work with Mungo Hardwicke-Brown to see if we can come up with something.   If you do not believe that it is a worthwhile project or have considered this idea in the past and found it to be unworkable, please let me know, and we will not work on it further.Regards,Peter\n"

We had this approach from Stu Staley and Pierre Aury. My line to them has basically been: we will provide best shipping advice promptly: please refer all your queries in this regard to Justin Boyd's team ie first contact: Robert Quick, Rahul Saxena, then any other team members, including Justin and failing them, me. So far, we are far from being swamped with technical shipping issues that we cannot deal with in-house. As and when we get to that position, we have good relationships with the best shipping firms in London, including Richards Butler and Sinclair Roche and Temperley. This may be adequate cover at that stage. Alternatively we may decide to recruit. In making that decision we would of course consult with George and Stu and the rest of the team. My view is that we are not at that stage yet. I would love this business to expand to the position where we needed to do that, and I hope we get there soon. When we do, we will ensure these business areas are properly covered until we get new staff on board. The business will not be prejudiced by a wait and see approach.This approach has satisfied Stu and Pierre. Of course we have to be flexible; if George is adamant and prepared to fund the recruitment, then off we go. I think I could persuade him however that he didn't need to do that now. What are your views on this?Subject to how you want to play things / have already played things with George, I would propose to speak to Stu and Pierre about this again and then call George to ensure he is happy with the game plan.I'll try to call you both tomorrow morning your time to discuss this.Thanks.

Australia --- Northwest Shelf LNG \"Wedge Quantities\" bid.   Proposal for mid-term, firm (but declining over time) LNG supply for merchant trading activities prepared and being sent to NWS next week.   Preparation and negotiations of SPA, transportation and marketing contracts to follow.2. Australia --- Northwest Shelf LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement --- draft prepared and being sent to counterparty next week.   Negotiations to follow.3. Indonesia --- PERTAMINA Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement --- draft prepared and being sent to counterparty next week.   Negotiations to follow.4. Japan --- Osaka Gas Co. Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement --- draft prepared and sent to counterparty.   Expect responsive comments next week.   Negotiations to follow.5. Malaysia/Spain --- LNG fuel supply for Enron's Arcos IPP in Spain --- initial term sheet under development.   Expect this one to heat up in the next few months.6. Malaysia --- Malaysia LNG Master Spot LNG Trading Agreement --- draft prepared and will be sent to counterparty later in the month.   Negotiations to follow.7. Malaysia --- \"Bintulu Hub\" e-commerce venture with Malaysia LNG, Malaysia Int'l. Trading Co., Enron LNG Marketing and Enron Networks --- under development.   Legal needs will depend somewhat on final deal format.   Goal is to be set up for LNG commodity and LNG transportation capacity e-trading (possibly on a Deal Bench auction site platform) by year-end.   May expand to cover crude oil commodity and transportation capacity trading as well following recent meetings in London.8. Japan --- LNG Receiving Terminal &amp; gas and power marketing joint development project with Enron LNG Marketing LLC, BHP and EnCom.   Initial draft of joint development MOU prepared.   Negotiations to follow.9. Korea --- KOGAS Winter Cargo Supply &amp; Transportation Opportunities --- under develoopment.   Various MOU drafts have been exchanged, but deal structure and timing keep moving around.   Legal needs will ultimately depend somewhat on final deal format. 10. Master LNG Vessel Transportation Capacity Access/Trading Agreements --- under early development, but should accelerate to match pace of no. 7 above.   Document will then be used to propose access to numerous other LNG vessel owners/charterers who may wish to participate with Enron in making a market for spare transportation capacity.   Initial draft underway in Houston, but may be handed off to Singapore at some point.As you can see, there's presently quite a lot of activity being undertaken from Singapore.   Much of this has arisen since the beginning of this year.

Moss\re-Journal Number: 8387\rJudge(s): Per Curiam - Neff, Talbot, and Sullivan\r The prosecution introduced sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact=\r=20\rto conclude that defendant acted willfully and maliciously, regardless of=\r=20\rwhether he was intoxicated to some degree, when he set fire to the victims'=\r=20\rhome. Even if defendant was drunk when arrested approximately 222 hours afte=\rr=20\rthe fire, his intoxication did not bear any relation to his state of mind o=\rn=20\rthe night of the fire. The testimony indicated that even if defendant was=\r=20\rintoxicated, he remained fully capable of entertaining the necessary specif=\ric=20\rintent.

Rose\re-Journal Number: 8385\rJudge(s): Per Curiam - McDonald, Sawyer, and White\r The trial court erred in suppressing defendant's statements to police on th=\re=20\rbasis that defendant was in custody and thus entitled to Miranda warnings=\r=20\rfrom the outset of the interview.

The officer's failure to=\r=20\rtell defendant that he was being investigated for CSC did not alter the fac=\rt=20\rthat defendant was told he was free to leave, or render the interview a=20\rcustodial one. Further, under the totality of the circumstances, defendant'=\rs=20\rstatements were knowingly and voluntarily made, and were not the product of=\r=20\rpsychological coercion. Defendant was 21-years old, had completed three yea=\rrs=20\rof college, and discerned the focus of the officer's inquiries soon after t=\rhe=20\rinterview began.

Jeff Hodge, please let me know if my assumptions are correct in the US.\tPeter Keohane\tSent by: Sharon Crawford\t06/01/20001 02:56 PM \t\t\t To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Jonathan McKay/CAL/ECT@ECT, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Sumas IndexMark, our contracts at Sumas (which is a U.S. border delivery point in British Columbia) are settled against the Inside F.E.R.C. Sumas Index.   Inside F.E.R.C. is now requiring that, in addition to pure trading data, we must also provide counterparty identification.   On the basis that we cannot provide that counterparty identification, both due to contractual obligations and business policies/practices, our information was excluded from the Sumas Index for the last index period.   I know, for example, in negotiating the settlement with NGX, that the provision of counterparty identification was a matter of very serious concern, particularly for Andy Zipper who manages EOL.However, I am advised by Jon McKay that, notwithstanding these apparent contractual restrictions and business policies/practices, Houston provides counterparty identifications to Inside F.E.R.C.The problem is that if we do not provide these counterparty identifications, our information will be excluded from the Sumas Index, which is particularly problematic with Sumas already being a relatively illiquid point.   On the other hand, if we do provide counterparty identification, we run the risk of breaching confidentiality obligations, business policies/practices and upsetting our trading counterparties.I guess we have two alternatives, one is to continue to not disclose counterparty identifications and hope that Inside F.E.R.C. will change its view on this (although, as I mentioned, their position is that Houston provides them with that information), or provide counterparty identifications at the risk of getting offside our counterparties.My preference would be to do the former, but I think this is a matter you may want to review with Lavo and let me know how Houston intends to proceed.Regards,Peter\n"

More good news from Argentina!   Today the Argentine Supreme Court granted TGS an injunction against payment of the stamp tax assessed by the Province of Rio Negro pending resolution of the matter.   Rio Negro recently rejected TGS's final administrative appeal against payment of the tax with penalties and interest in the amount of US $436 million!   Rio Negro had ordered payment by April 26 and threatened to commence collection proceedings.   Recall that 3 weeks ago, the Court also granted TGS an injunction against payment of the tax in Santa Cruz in the amount of US $17 million which was unprecedented.Dodged another bullet!Cheers!Michelle \n"

I believe we made some progress yesterday on the overall look and feel of the site. Meeting Notes:Mark - Presented ideas for the look and feel of the web site based on law firm web sites and intra-Enron sites.   I will continue to pursue work with the IT group on the design and implementation of the site.Michelle - Reported on her progress with the ENA PR group on a name.   click.legal or click.law seem to be the favorite addresses; however, \"legalmatters.enron\" was also suggested.   Michelle will continue to work with the ENA PR group to develop a name, possible logo and slogan/tag-line consistent with the Enron vision statement.Janette - Reported on the status of the organization chart information to be used on the site.   Indicated she is still waiting for responses from several of the groups for the \"who are we\" paragraph.   She is also making progress on matching the org. chart to the individual legal team members.   Work on this project will continue.Ed/James - Both reported on the status of link identification.   Discussion took place regarding the further identification of categories associated with the links and those links that will be useful to the Department, realizing that few clients will actual access our site for links.   Work on a listing of categories and sites for these categories will continue.General Information:Subsequent to our meeting, I met with our designated IT project coordinator - Tamika Hebert.   We spent almost two hours discussing the functionality we want in the site.   Unfortunately, John Reese, our IT designer, was out of the office and unable to provide me with the design ideas he has to date.   I hope to receive these designs later today or tomorrow and will make them available to everyone for comment.   I also provided Tamika with references to some of the sites we reviewed during our meeting so that she could understand some of the look, feel and functionality we want.Concerning actual development of the background structure, the \"programmer\" has not been identified for this project, but should be by the end of this week.   Once he/she is identified, work will begin on the design of the functionality of the site.   Concurrent with this effort, it is necessary that we start providing content to Tamika so that site areas can be tested and reviewed.   Accordingly, once information is available in your respective areas, please provide it to me or forward it directly to Tamika.Reminder - Please remember to note that we have moved the time of the meeting from 2:000 to 2:30.   Our next meeting will be next Wednesday, November 1 in EB38C2.Thanks again for the hard work.MarkSenior Counsel, ENAPhone:   713-345-88897Facsimile: 713-646-3940E-Mail:   Mark.Greenberg@enron.com\n"

Mark\tChristian Yoder\t01/04/20001 03:37 PM \t\t\t To: William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tracy Ngo/PDX/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Earline Kendall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Holsworth/Corp/Enron@ENRON\t\t\t Subject: The Ongoing CalPX Indemnity Agreement IssueThe CalPx has written us a letter saying that if we do not sign their proposed indemnity agreement by January 12, we will have to post collateral (letter of credit) for the full extent of our exposure to them (approx $25million).   Implicit in this demand is the threat that if we do not post the collateral, they will not allow us to do any business with them.All things considered, I recommend that we consider posting the collateral and that we do not sign the indemnity agreement.   This recommendation assumes that we want to continue to do some residual business with the CalPX.   Obviously, if our traders don't care about doing any business with them, we should just call their bluff and quit trading with them, but I don't think we would really want to do this.The reason why I do not think we should sign the indemnity agreement is because it exposes us (Enron Corp.) to the very real PX credit meltdown risk.   Under the PX's Surety Bond with AIG,   if creditors of the CalPX,   say, the big three California Utilities for example,   teetering as they are on the brink of insolvency,   were to default to the PX, then AIG must keep the CalPX whole.   If AIG pays any money to the PX, it will immediately turn to its indemnity agreements with all the non-defaulting participants (including ours)   and try to recover from them.   Although the indemnity agreements purport to limit   AIG's ability to recover from us to our own specific default with the PX,   I do not think we should rely on the wording of the agreement to guarantee that we would not be washed into some kind of broader claim by AIG in a meltdown situation.   The wording is too ambiguous.   If I were outside counsel, I would not write us a legal opinion saying that if we signed the indemnity agreement we would not have any exposure in a meltdown.   Therefore, given the solvency crisis with the big three utilities, I think we should assume there will be a major payment default and   I think,   if we must continue to do business with the PX, we should do it on the basis of posting collateral for our exposure.   Such collateral would be clearly tied to our own default and we should be able to control our own default risk with them.   I have asked Tracy to set up a conference call to go over this reasoning.   ---cgy \n"

Immediate changes include the following:* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). * Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. * Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. * Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). * Create congestion management design proposal. * Establish generation inter-connection procedures. * Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. * Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load and reserve requirements. FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 20002: * Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below $150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this amount in the auction. * If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price paid by all. * Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. * The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n"

One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market.   The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids.   So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.---"

In essence, we thought that:Only upon the parties' mutually agreement would the use of a qualified independent expert (arbitrator) subject to AA rules (note: the current language in the draft would need to be changed to clarify that AA rules would apply to the IE's proceedings) be the appropriate mechanism for the expeditious handling of a narrow group of technical disputes (\"Technical Disputes\"). Primarily, these would be disputes over the adjustment of the contract price for a change order or the date of a milestone or completion date due a change order. In the interests of an expeditious resolution, the current draft should be changed to reflect that the IE's decisions would be final, and non-appealable, as contrasted with the current draft where in certain instances they can be appealed to the three-arbitrator panel.The \"baseball arbitration\" approach required in the current draft should be used by the IE for these Technical Disputes only, and would not apply to disputes handled by the three-arbitrator Panel. The commercial people on the Enron LNG side of the table like baseball arbitration b/c they believe it mitigates the possibility of claims inflation by the Contractor in these change order price disputes. All other disputes under the Contract would be handled by a three-arbitrator panel (\"Panel\") subject to AA rules, which would also handle all Technical Disputes if the parties cannot mutually agree to an IE.The Dispute Resolution Section of the draft Contract should be refined in some areas to provide greater clarity. Andy and Ned are in the process of doing this.If you have any questions before you visit with Vicki or John, please advise any of us.Alan---"

As noted below, Jim Newsome has been selected as Acting Chair.   I mentioned this to Ken Raisler and Stacy Carey.   Everyone agrees that Newsome is a known quantity, though he may not be a superstar in the mold of Bill Ranier.   Ken said Newsome knows our issues and is favorable to a \"free market\" approach to energy and metals.   However, there is some concern about his ability to reign in the CFTC staff.   Newsome is the favorite currently for the position with boosters in Senators Lott and Cochran and his college roommate Rep. Jerry Moran (R-KS).   However, it is still early in the game and unknown Chair candidates could still be out there (including officials passed over for more high profile positions).If Newsome is nominated as the Chair, an additional Commissioner (a Republican) position opens and will be named by Speaker Denny Hastert.   Hastert is from the suburbs and the assumption is that he the Chicago exchanges may influence the appointment.   Stacy Carey is poking around to determine what Chicago exchanges are thinking.   One name that has been mentioned often is retired Congressman Tom Ewing who has expressed interest in a Commission seat, but not the Chair (Ewing is supportive of our issues).David Spears is also likely to leave, but no date has been announced.   This is also a Republican seat.   The Democrats Barbara Holum and Tom Erickson are likely to stick around until their terms expire.We can try to float names of persons we would like to see either Chair or join the Commission.   Also, we have learned that Wendy Gramm has list of names she may be shopping around for CFTC and SEC - it would be good the see who Gramm is proposing.Please advise how you want to proceed in either reviewing or suggesting the appointees.Thanks - Chris No. 05 Monday January 8, 20001\tPage A-4 \tISSN 1523-567X\tRegulation, Law &amp; Economics \tFutures TradingNewsome Elected Acting Chair;Favors 'Free-Market' PhilosophyThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission has elected Jim Newsome as its acting chairman, the agency announced Jan. 5. Newsome, a Republican, will assume the role played by outgoing Chairman William Rainer, who announced last month that he would resign his position effective Jan. 19. Newsome, a native of Plant City, Fla., was nominated to the CFTC in July 19998 and sworn in Aug. 10 that same year. Immediately before joining the commission, Newsome was chairman of the Mississippi Agribusiness Council and served as executive vice president of the Mississippi Cattlemen's Association and Mississippi Beef Council. Levels of OversightNewsome, who could not be reached for comment Jan. 5, told BNA last month that he favors a \"free-market philosophy,\" something he said helped him work productively with the like-minded Rainer, who was a Democrat. He praised in particular the CFTC's new regulatory framework that was approved by the commission last fall. The rulemaking largely was withdrawn after Congress essentially codified the initiative in the Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed in December. The new tiered-system creates different levels of oversight meant to differentiate between different levels of investor sophistication. \"We've tried to develop a much more flexible regulatory scheme that allows for more competition for futures markets participants,\" Newsome said.

I have visited with Jim Derrick about having a legal/business committee representing your major groups.   It would function in a similar manner as our Y2K committee did.   We would have Fulbright &amp; Jaworski give our people general instructions, our business people would canvass our companies to determine what we considered proprietary trade secrets and if we were not protecting our proprietary information appropriately, we could address that issue.   Fulbright could also be used on an ad hoc basis.   Costs would be shared proportionately between the major groups except special fees attributable to a specific operating group.   I believe we need this inventory.   If we try to enforce our non-competition agreements and we can't prove that we kept such information on a need to know basis and properly secured, we could lose the law suit.   Jim asked that I contact each of you regarding this to see if you were in agreement with the proposed plan.   Please respond as soon as possible if you agree so we can get the project off the ground.\n"

Mark\tMichelle Cash\t04/111/20001 111:333 PM \t\t\t To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: Mark,As a practical matter, I believe that it will be difficult to maintain an updated inventory of confidential information on an ongoing basis.   That conceivably could be someone's full-time job, given the vast amount of confidential and proprietary projects at issue just within EWS.   I do agree that we need to put some protocols in place with regard to how Enron handles different levels of confidential information (including trade secrets).   Rather than have an ongoing commission guided by outside counsel, I would suggest that Pete, Scott Tholan, the IT security team, internal corporate security, as well as legal subject matter experts get together to put forth guidelines on how information should be retained and protected.   Those guidelines would describe the type of information at issue and the corresponding security measures to put in place to protect that material.   For example, trading positions and curves would have one standard for access and disclosure, while personnel information would have a different one.   The benefit to this approach is that we can set the guidelines and manage on a periodic basis to make sure that they are followed, rather than create updated inventories.   It also presumably would save on outside counsel fees.   I would not view this type of approach as requiring much, if any, assistance from outside counsel.Let me know your thoughts.Michelle---Michelle CashEnron North America Corp.14000 Smith Street, EB 3823Houston, Texas   7770002(713) 853-6401michelle.cash@enron.comThis message may contain confidential information that is protected by the attorney-client and/or work product privileges.\tMark E Haedicke\t04/111/01 03:000 PM \t\t\t To: Michelle Cash/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Mark Holsworth/Enron@EnronXGate\t\t\t Subject: How would we do this efficiently in EWS?

The reason for the meeting was really a pitch of second round funding from Enron to the tune of $10MM to $15MM.   The secondary focus was on the product and its usefulness to Enron. Steve made it clear that any funding decision would be driven 1000% by a decision by the Legal Department to use the tool and, thus, it was up to Legal to review it and see where to go.The demonstration of the tool was impressive.   Though it does act as a traditional shopping type site in many respects, it also has functionality to create a \"myelaw\" page customized to the information you, the user are the most interested in seeing.   It also allows for a query into further information, which query is then forwarded to the law firms (or firm) supporting the practice area (e.g. Labor/Employment) for comment.   There is also the ability to set up an Enron library so that information on topics developed by Enron retained firms can be loaded, organized and maintained, including legal opinions, memoranda on various topics and form pleadings/documents.   This area is secure from the balance of the site so that other users cannot access the information.   The loading process is fairly easy and could easily be implemented within a firm environment.   Some of the functionality that would be the most useful is due to be released in a new version coming out early Q1 and by the end of 20001 there is the plan to have at least 10 or so practice areas available.   Right now the focus is on Environmental, Intellectual Property, Health Care, and Tax.I think the tool could be useful, especially in relation to the organization of information we obtain from our outside sources.   It may also complement the website/portal concept we are currently looking to make a part of the website/portal development process.   I would be curious to see, however, what other tools are out there doing the same or similar function.eVelocity - I met this afternoon with Mike Griffs (sp?) to discuss the eVelocity tool.   It was presented as a portal concept to link the law firm and our legal department solely for the movement, review and payment of law firm invoices.   While it is billed as a system capable of interfacing with a matter management system, it can, itself, be used as a matter management tool.The capabilities of the system revolve around the determination of a set of rules that are applicable to law firm invoices.   For example, say Enron does not pay more than $0.10 per page of copying.   This can be set as a rule so that any invoice loaded into eVelocity by a law firm containing more than this amount per page would be automatically rejected.   The rejection would then require the law firm to adjust the bill accordingly and resubmit it to the system.   This same functionality can be put in place on the Enron side so that the rule requires the bill to come into Enron for review, but notes that it is not compliant with the established rules so that the reviewing attorney is alerted to the issue.   The system does identify the problem so you do not have to search the entire invoice to see what differs from the rules.   It is possible to   establish rules that would allow an invoice, presuming it complied with all rules, to be automatically approved and moved to AP for payment.   This would require interfacing with AP and the SAP system, but it could be done.In addition to the above functionality, the system can also track matters, budgets for matters, costs incurred for a matter and the name of the law firm people who are authorized to bill against a specific matter.   Reports can be generated in an number of formats to assess financial performance against a budget or overall costs for various matters.   Finally, since it is a web/browser based system, implementation is not difficult and there is not a lot of IT involvement needed.I specifically asked why any other matter management system would be needed and received the response that there really is no such need.   Mike indicated a pilot program would take no more than two to three weeks to set up.In keeping with the ideas surrounding the technology plan developed for EWS, as well as similar ideas presented for the Corp. portal/website, it makes sense to look at implementing a matter management system of some sort that goes beyond litigation tracking.   Whether or not it is eVelocity or another comparable tool would require further research into the available products, but I believe it would be worth while to pursue maybe in a pilot program atmosphere.What I have provided above is a general overview of the products and meetings surrounding the demonstrations.   If either of you would like further information or have any questions, please let me know.MarkSenior Counsel, ENAPhone:   713-345-88897Facsimile: 713-646-3940E-Mail:   Mark.Greenberg@enron.com\n"

I am looking forward to an offer coming in this week from a small public company that wants me to develop a new business development group and increase their sales from $10MM to $50MM over the next couple of   years and get the stock price up. I am still operating the fitness company but it is quickly coming to an end due to running out of money so I am looking forward to finding a new position in the next couple of weeks. Everyone is settled into school and doing well. What is new with you and your family? Debbie and I sent you and Susan a gift a month or so ago for having Bryan stay with you. Did you receive it?

The Legal Team meeting will be held every other Friday at 9:000 Houston time (currently 12:000 noon S?o Paulo/Rio time) starting tomorrow.   The idea of the smaller group meeting is to get updates on the key deals/assets in the region so we can keep Houston current on a weekly basis when the larger legal staff meeting is not scheduled.   While the group included on this call may change from time to time as deal priorities change, currently I would like to allocate reporting responsibility as follows:   Arap (key trading/origination deals); Watanabe (Eletrobolt); Vasco (Elektro); Porto (CEG/Gas Business Unit); Mendoza (Transredes sale process); and Novak (Cuiab?).I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.Rgds, JohnTime: 9:000 a.m. (Houston time)/12:000p.m. (Brazil time)Intl call in #: 1 (954) 797-19444Domestic call in #: 1 (8777) 475-92228Participant code: 22249333Host code: 66622276Host: John Novak\n"

Restructuring MeetingMemo to Credit Derivatives Documentation Task Force:We have arranged for meetings of the Credit Derivatives Documentation TaskForce to take place simultaneously in New York and London on Monday,November 13, at 9:30 NY time/2:30 London time. The New York meeting willtake place at the offices of Chase Manhattan Bank, 270 Park Avenue, 111thFloor, Room C. The London meeting will take place at the offices of MorganStanley Dean Witter, 20 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14.   Please RSVPto Barbara Hanlon at bhanlon@isda.org indicating at which location you willbe attending.At each meeting, I will arrange for several individuals to present theirview on the Restructuring issue. There will then be an opportunity in eachmeeting to ask questions of those individuals and for more generaldiscussion. We will then link the London and New York meetings by telephoneto share views between the meetings. This distribution list is drawn from participants in the documentationprocess. The Restructuring issue, while focused on a term in thedocumentation, is nevertheless one of market practice and not really one ofdocumentation. We, therefore, encourage you to ensure that the views of yourtrading desk are expressed at the meeting, preferably by having someone fromthe desk at the meeting. We expect a large number of people at the meetings,however, so we also encourage you to consider who from your institution ismost critical to be in attendance to ensure that your views are heard. We look forward to hearing from you on the 13th.

The methodology I used is as follows:   (1) We each ended up with one exhibition game.   (2) The two of you expressed a preference for weekend nights.   Thereare 12 Friday and Saturday games, so I gave each of you six.   (3)   I tried to give you games where you will not be out of town(although I ended up giving each of you one game where both of you will beout of town).   (4) I divided the teams into good teams (Trailblazers, Jazz, Heat,Spurs, Lakers,   Knicks, Pacers and Sonics), medium teams (Timberwolves,Hornets, Kings, 76ers, Cavaliers, Suns, Celtics and Nets) and bad teams(Bulls, Pistons, Grizzlies, Wizards, Magic, Clippers, Mavericks, Bucks,Nuggets, Warriors, Raptors and Hawks), and I tried to divide the teams sothat there was a realtively even distribution of team levels. Mark ended upwith 5-7-6, Rob with 6-3-9 and I ended up with 2-1-2.   Although Rob has onemore good team than Mark has, he get to see more dogs.   I am not 1000%certain that I have a good handle on whose going to be good, mediocre andbad, and there were some teams that might be bad but I put in a mediumcategory because they are interesting (e.g. 76ers, Celtics and Nets).   (5) Finally, I attempted to minimize the repeats.   But it ended upthat Mark has the Timberwolves and Grizzlies   twice, and Rob has theWarriors and Nuggets twice.   And, of course, if you don't like what I did you can always trade.   This was a highly scientific process, done with the aid of Lotus1-2-3.Mark: please note that I have given you Tuesday night's tickets vs. theLakers.Bob   5   Tuesday, 111/14, Chicago Bulls   12   Tuesday, 12/19, San Antonio Spurs   15   Wednesday, 12/27, Seattle Supersonics   16   Thursday, 1/4, Detroit Pistons   333   Thursday, 3/15, New Jersey Nets   Mark   1   Tuesday, 10/31, Minnesota Timberwolves   3   Tuesday, 111/7, Los Angeles Lakers   4   Thursday, 111/9, Vancouver Grizzlies   6   Thursday, 111/16, Charlotte Hornets   8   Tuesday, 111/28, Sacramento Kings   9   Saturday, 12/2, Portland Trailblazers   17   Saturday, 1/6, Utah Jazz   20   Wednesday, 1/24, Philadelphia 76ers   21   Friday, 1/26, Vancouver Grizzlies   222   Tuesday, 1/30, Miami Heat   25   Tuesday, 2/13, Washington Wizards   26   Saturday, 2/17, Cleveland Cavaliers   28   Friday, 2/23, Orlando Magic   30   Thursday, 3/8, Los Angeles Clippers   34   Saturday, 3/17, San Antonio Spurs   36   Thursday, 3/29, Phoenix Suns   37   Tuesday, 4/3, Dallas Mavericks   41   Tuesday, 4/17, Minnesota Timberwolves   Rob   2   Thursday, 111/2, Milwaukee Bucks   7   Saturday, 111/18, Phoenix Suns   10   Tuesday, 12/5, Dallas Mavericks   111   Saturday, 12/16, Denver Nuggets   13   Thursday, 12/21, Los Angeles Lakers   14   Saturday, 12/23, Golden State Warriors   18   Saturday, 1/13, Sacramento Kings   19   Tuesday, 1/16, Toronto Raptors   23   Thursday, 2/1, Los Angeles Clippers   24   Monday, 2/5, New York Knicks   27   Tuesday, 2/20, Boston Celtics   29   Monday, 2/26, Portland Trailblazers   31   Saturday, 3/10, Golden State Warriors   32   Tuesday, 3/13, Indiana Pacers   35   Tuesday, 3/27, Utah Jazz   38   Thursday, 4/5, Seattle Supersonics   39   Saturday, 4/7, Atlanta Hawks   40   Tuesday, 4/10, Denver Nuggets   Robert S.

The various trade associations will be mostresponsive to the idea if they are hearing strong support for a singleagreement from decision-making levels within member firms. We willseparately continue or commence a dialogue with the trade associations thatsponsor various agreements or are active in the areas of the financialproducts that would be covered by such an agreement.The trade associations we have identified as likely to be important to thisproject are the following:Securities Industry Association (US)The Bond Market Association (US)International Securities Market Association (principally Europe)European Banking Federation (Europe)The Foreign Exchange Committee (NY, London, Tokyo)Emerging Markets Traders AssociationThe following associations may also be helpful to the process:Australian Financial Markets AssociationBritish Bankers AssociationJapan Securities Dealers AssociationCanadian Bankers AssociationInternational Primary Markets Association (London-based)ACI (The Foreign Exchange Association)(Paris-based)_If your firm is active in any of these organizations, we encourage you todiscuss as soon as possible with your representative within thatorganization the need to support the development of a single agreement forfinancial products and urge them to express their support to theassociations. If it would be useful to share with them the thoughts in mymemorandum to the board, please feel free to do so. I have attached anedited version which deletes the last couple of sections on my discussionswith the BMA, the Russo-Carlin group, Ernie Patrikis's letter and possibleapproaches for ISDA.I will try to contact each of you over the course of the next week to getyour feedback.

Mark and I will discuss with Alan his original proposal of adding a footer to company emails and get back to the group.   Until then no footer will be added.   With respect to Paulette, I understand that each of you agree to bear your proportionate share of her cost for the budget year 2000---although the basis of that allocation is still to be agreed.   Finally, we agreed to discuss what projects we would like for our technology committee to undertake.   I propose that we discuss this topic during next Thursday's meeting---since Jim will be out of town we can have this meeting in lieu of the regular meeting.   I think having this discussion now would be helpful and I think the technology group would greatly benefit from the meeting as well.   Let me know if that is acceptable to you.   Thanks.---",

        " Michael R Brown/LON/ECT on 09/08/2000 111:49 ---Mark Elliott08/08/2000 14:59To: Joe Gold/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve W Young/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Sage/LON/ECT@ECT, Andrew Cornfield/LON/ECT@ECT, Tim Davies/LON/ECT@ECT, Diana Higgins/LON/ECT@ECT, Tina Ward/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael Schuh/FRA/ECT@ECT, Gregor Baumerich/LON/ECT@ECT, Heribert Kresse/FRA/ECT@ECT, Sandip Joshi/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: URGENT &amp; IMPORTANT: Note re main legal risks re the EEX Spot MarketJoe,Further to our discussion yesterday, when you mentioned that you wished to commence trading on the EEX Spot Market on and from Wednesday 9th August, I set out below the main elements of legal risk, as I see them, in the various elements of the Exchange Rules.   You should note as a general matter that the Exchange Rules are largely vague and ambiguous which only heightens the potential legal legal risk.The Counterparty to our tradesEnron's counterparties to trades will be the individual market participants with whom our bids and offers get matched - our counterparty will not be the Exchange itself or a clearing house.We shall only be told the identity of the counterparty(ies) with whom we have neen matched after that matching process has occurred.   There is no mechanism to filter counterparties based on credit quality, types of counterparty etc.   Hence, there is no effective credit control left to trading participants over whom they should do deals with.Collateral ArrangementsAs far as security by way of collateral for trading exposures among the participants is concerned, initial collateral of Euros 1000,000 is posted with the Exchange in one of the prescribed methods (bank guarantee, cash,etc) via one's \"clearing\" bank.   The Exchange will monitor the exposures of all the counterparties and can require more collateral to be posted overnight, on a variation margin basis, if a counterparty is exposed over the level of collateral previously posted.   Note that the collateral which the Exchange may require to be posted does not seem to include cover for any unpaid amounts where a participant has not paid for power delivered - it appears that it will only cover the mark-to-market value of deals struck on the Exchange which remain outstanding (i.e., pre-delivery)In terms of the amount of collateral required to be posted, it would appear that each trade will be calculated on a gross, rather a net, basis (even for buys and sells with the same counterparty and not just trades with different counterparties).   The rules are very vague here.   I would suggest that your traders and RAC touch base on this issue and understand - by speaking to the Exchange if necessary - exactly the methodology of calculating our collateral posting requirement.   Whilst the Exchange will monitor the participants' exposures and call for margin from the Participants' clearing banks as appropriate, there is an obligation imposed on each participant itself to be able itself to monitor its own exposures and its own collateral posting requirement.   It is unclear whether the Exchange has provided sufficient information in relation to the model to be used to enable us to fulfill this requirement.   I suggest that back office and RAC look into this immediately in conjunction with your trading staff.   Technically we can have our membership suspended if we do not comply with the Rules; more importantly,   from a good buisness practice perspective, we should be able to comply with the rules plus be able to know these figures each day.   RAC and your traders should therefore check that we can do this immediately.   In the event that a counterparty defaults, there are two points to note.   Firstly, what constitutes a default is unclear.   The Rules state that a default is where a counterparty is, to quote, \"unable\" to meet its obligations under the Rules.   Strictly, inability (e.g., insolvency) would not cover unwillingness (e.g.,,, counterparty can pay but does not wish to pay for whatever reason).   Clifford Chance Germany have advised me that they feel that a German court would stretch the meaning to include unwillingness to meet obligations   but, of course, point out that this would be for a judge ultimately to decide.Secondly,   even if a counterparty is in default as defined, there is no absolute legal obligation on the EEX to realise / call upon the collateral posted with it.   This will depend upon whether the management board of the EEX exercsies a discretion to instruct the EEX to do so.   In my view. the Exchange could well take the view that as the trades are a matter between the individual participants (as the Exchange is not the counterparty), the Exchange may well be unwilling to realise collateral until the outcome of arbitration between the parties to a dispute.   Clearly this could be a number of weeks or months after the non-payment dispute arose and hence increasing our credit risk.   Please note that there is no clear recourse to the Exchange in the event that the Exchange itself refuses to realise collateral.If the Exchange does realise the collateral however, it will hold it for the benefit of all Participants.   Note, however, that this does not seem to cover previously unpaid amounts as mentioned above. TaxesEnd consumers can be participants on the Exchange.   As this is the case, if we get matched with an end consumer, then apparently we open ourselves up to potential liability to pay German energy taxes.   Clifford Chance have advise me that, whilst this remains an unresolved issue, apparently the German fiscal authorities appear only to ensure that German-based entities pay such tax, rather than foreign-based ones such as ECTRL, which is our trading participant.   If you require further details on this, please refer to Tina Ward in Tax Department.Renewable Energy Sources Act.Again, if we, as a seller, were matched with an end-consumer, then under this Act we are obliged to ensure that we source approximately 3.45% of the energy sold from a renewable source.   I understand that this is approximately 4 times as expensive as normal domestic power, coming in at around 16.75 pfennigs per kWh.   It is entirely unclear how this will be monitored and enforced in respect of dealings on the Exchange, although Cliffords' view is that this will be done in some way through the Balancing mechanism.   May be your traders should look into this in greater detail, should it be of concern. SettlementOn a purely logistical level, for your general information, please note that physical power delivery is T+1, whereas Buyer settles T+2. The Exchange states that bills from sellers to buyers will go to the buyers via the Exchnage.   It is unclear how the mechanics of this work (they are not dealt with in the Rules to any greater extent).   I would suggest that your trading staff and our settlements staff look into this immediately, by speaking directly to the Exchange if necessary.   It should also be borne in mind that I assume that invoices will have to raised and issued within the T+2 framework.IMPORTANT NOTE:Clearly we want eventually to put this trading participation thorough a formal and final CACs   process (the rules have totally altered since we CACs'd it last time three weeks ago).   However, I understand that you would like to be able to trade from tomorrow, which will be a few days in advance of the CACs   process (additional rules in German have only just been sent to me, and hence I cannot tell you at present what is the import of these).   In this respect, please note that ECTRL is joining as a Market-Maker and hence, under the Exchange Rules, if you wish to proceed, we would have the obligation from tomorrow to quote firm two way prices during normal market opening hours.   The Exchange can promulgate rules prescribing the length of time for which bids / offers are active, minimum / maximum volumes bid / offerred, the width of spreads, etc.,.; I understand from Clifford Chance that the Exchange has not yet prescribed these rules.   What we do know at the moment is that if we fail \"too often\" to quote as a market maker, then the exchange can remove / suspend us as a trading participant.   In order to mitigate your risk at present therefore, you may wish to consider the size of volumes we would quote and width of spreads, etc..., and discuss with RAC and / or Credit beforehand.Finally, I understand that: (a) Dresdner's banking terms for us have still not been agreed (apparently these are being dealt with at an Enron Houston Legal Department level) and therefore I cannot tell you whether Dresdner would be willing to provide the collateral guarantee etc before these are agreed and (b) I understand that the EEX still has some outstanding points re our Balancing arrangements which would need to be finalised before we could trade.   Sandip is in contact with Enron Houston over (a) and I understand that Heribert and Michael Schuh are dealing with the Balancing arrangements.   Subject to clearing the items in (a) and (b), and discussing volumes, spread etc with RAC / Credit etc.,   if you wish to proceed tomorrow, please let me know as I shall need to write to the Exchange this afternoon informing them of this (our application forms were submitted under the caveat that we would write to them when we wished our membership to go active).Kind regardsMark   \n"

One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market.   The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids.   So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.---",

Immediate changes include the following:* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). * Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. * Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. * Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). * Create congestion management design proposal. * Establish generation inter-connection procedures. * Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. * Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load and reserve requirements. FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 20002: * Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below $150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this amount in the auction. * If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price paid by all. * Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. * The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n"

The following is such list:January through June with ENANSTAR All RequirementsTransaction - While similar in structure to the United Illuminating transaction, the NSTAR deal provided challenge in that it came together in a very accelerated time frame.   We did not have the luxury of 6 months of negotiations as we did in UI.   We essentially structured and executed a deal in less than 3 weeks.   It was also a challenge in that I had no experience working with these particular clients (Kevin Presto, Dana Davis, Ed Baughman and John Llodra of East Power Trading/Mid Markets.   Another significant hurdle was the education process of the utility and its attorneys which was essential to get them comfortable with the complexities of an all requirements trading document.Consolidated Edison Turbine deal - This transaction was blown up at the eleventh hour, it was another challenging deal which required a creative structure to flip turbines into a project and take back a call on power.   Again the education of the utility and structuring of the transaction made this particular deal difficult.July through November with ECCSunoco structured power transaction - This was the first project I worked on in the Toronto office and was the first back to back transaction completed off of the British Energy PPA.   While the Calgary lawyers had put together a very good back to back precedent, there was still a great deal of negotiation involved in completing the deal and complexity involved in maintaining the requisite back to back transaction.G-6 structured transaction - This deal just (as of 40 minutes ago) blew up.   Notwithstanding that the deal will not be completed, it was a very complicated deal which involved a highly negotiated services agreement, arrangements for ECC to take initial equity and an option for additional equity and trading documentation.   This project required negotiating with 6 municipal electric utilities who were trying to set up a retail affiliate to market power in Ontario.   The structure would have ECC as a risk management and settlement services provider in exchange for being the exclusive wholesale supplier of energy to the G-6.   This involved mitigating and structuring around a myriad of legal issues.TransCanada structured power transaction - This was another back to back transaction off of the British Energy position.   These deal was challenging in that it involved a more sophisticated counterparty who had certain idiosyncratic issues such as regulatory risk and credit.   We were able to structure a deal which balanced the parties competing interests and maintained the commercial value of the transaction for Enron.OEFC Non-Utility Generation Contract Management - We have just recently been awarded the project and have begun negotiations with OEFC regarding management of the NUG contracts.   However, the teamwork exhibited among legal and commercial and between the Toronto and Calgary legal and commercial groups showed how effective the ECC operation can be.   Your advice and initial review together with my implementation structured an RFP response that did the right thing: protected ECC from potential legal risks.   While there was commercial pressure to bend from these principals we stood our ground and as a result have a much stronger bargaining position.Transition from Houston to Toronto - While both you and Mark know that there were some initial issues with respect to working out the arrangements for my move from Houston to Toronto I believe that I have transitioned quite smoothly.   I think that I have quickly gained the respect and trust of those in the Toronto office and of Rob Milnthorp.   Being the lone lawyer in a satellite office presents unique challenges; especially when the commercial folks are not content doing bread and butter type transactions but rather present highly structured deal on a weekly or even daily basis.   I understand and appreciate that you have gone out of your way to provide support to me when I have had issues arise on Toronto matters. In return I feel that I have provided you with comfort that the legal interests of Enron Canada are being protected and that our commercial team is receiving top notch legal support.   I have done this while still managing all of the little things that go along with moving your family 2000 miles.RegardsCJG\n"

EPE --- FineFYI, I received verbal notice today that EPE has been fined in the amount of R$2.2 million (approx US$1.1 million) for failure to comply with its IPP license --- specifically, the failure to dispatch at 450 MW per the instructions of the ONS.   Aneel previously had delivered a notice of noncompliance to EPE and our response was delivered to Aneel on Friday, so the fine probably crossed our response in the mail.   This is another salvo in the ongoing dispute as to whether our PPA, which pre-dates the new regulatory scheme, is to be treated as an exception or whether it needs to be completely renegotiated in order to be able to comply with the current regs.   In any event, it is not good news.   I will keep you posted as I get more details.Regards, John\n"

After an e-mail harassment incident, Image First, a New Castle, Del., uniforms maker, notified workers that e-mail will be reviewed for any violation of its antiharassment policy.Fully 31% of more than 1,000 human-resources officials surveyed by Philadelphia labor-relations lawyer Stephen Cabot and the American Management Association reported that employees have sometimes gotten sexually harassing e-mails; 85% of the employers have policies to avert problems. Employers including First Union Corp., Charlotte, N.C., have fired people recently for sending harassing e-mail.Unlike in-person conduct, e-mail harassment is easy to prove since the electronic trail documents allegations, says Kathleen Neville, a sexual-harassment consultant.[...]---Albert R.
