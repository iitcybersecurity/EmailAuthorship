I can't believe that I've just finished my fifth month with Enron.   It's been great, though.   Everything is new so I'm learning a ton.   Working on a trading floor is quite a different environment than Pirnie.   My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico, although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,   and the number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.   I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in to become a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'll start trading.Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to the island (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't help feeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggae tour or diving trip.   So I was wondering if maybe I should come down some weekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back in alignment.   So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for a weekend and maybe do some diving or something.   If not, then no big deal, there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.   Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.   By the way, it was bittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.   Had he done so sooner, I would have taken his spot!   Anyway, wish everyone well and I'm curious to hear what's happening on the island these days.   Take care,Mat\n"

Technology has helped Enron create new=20\rbusinesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20\rresponsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.   You=\r=01,ve=20\rseen what technology can do at work.   Now we want you and your family to=20\rrealize its benefits at home.\r With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\rhe=20\rClickAtHome\rprogram, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20\rtechnology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=\r=20\rclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\r=20\rInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\r We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\r=20\rthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\r=20\rcase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\r=20\rcomputer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20\rClickAtHome includes the following:\r ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=\r=20\rdisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\r=20\rsoftware. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\r=20\rconnection, including broadband, where commercially available.\r? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\r=20\rand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\r=20\rhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\r,=20\rEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\raccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.   Eligibility includes being=20\remployed at the time of implementation. =20\r? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 20001, with delivery of=\r=20\rthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.   Delive=\rry=20\rof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 20001.\r Details about this program are still being finalized.   To address some of=\r=20\ryour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\r=20\rhttp:///clickathome.enron.com.   We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=\rar=20\rfuture where you will have an opportunity to ask questions.

I hear that business is well in Puerto Rico(although that was quite awhile ago so who knows).   I'm assuming that youare, indeed, still there.   I can't believe that I've just finished my fifthmonth with Enron.   It's been great, though.   Everything is new so I'mlearning a ton.   Working on a trading floor is quite a differentenvironment than Pirnie.   My desk is so small it reminds of Puerto Rico,although there are no bomb threats, the bell does not sound at lunch,   andthe number of holidays does not exceed the number of work days in the year.I've recently been accepted into a subprogram of the program I'm in tobecome a trader, so my next year is pretty much planned and eventually I'llstart trading.Anyway... I was just thinking the other day that I miss my trips to theisland (especially my accomodations at the Excelsior), and I can't helpfeeling a little shorted that I didn't get a follow-up event of the Reggaetour or diving trip.   So I was wondering if maybe I should come down someweekend and make it right., you know put all of the planets back inalignment.   So I was wondering if you might be able to put me up for aweekend and maybe do some diving or something.   If not, then no big deal,there's about zillion places I'd like to visit in the next few months.Just drop me a note sometime and let me know what you think.Please say hello to Pat, Joanne and Juan Carlos for me.   By the way, it wasbittersweet to hear Barry left soon after I did.   Had he done so sooner, Iwould have taken his spot!

      "body": "\nRegan,Hey, I hope things are still going well.   I've been thrown right into the mix right away and have barely had a minute to breathe.   I'm scheduling gas after the morning trades have been made which basically entails lining up the buyers and sellers to exchange contract numbers.   However, it's a great place to learn operational logistics.   The intent is that I'll be productive in the role immediately while learning the ropes.   As they hire the needed full-time schedulers and I get up to speed, I'll move into market research for the traders.   My first such assignment is to value storage in different markets based on historical gas pricing and injection-withdrawel strategies.   Let's just say my plate looks to be full.By the way, I'm sure you saw the previous email from our buddy, Ted Bland.   Looks like he got the message, although I'm still feeling like there's still some orientation regarding the A/A program itself that we're missing.   For instance, did you see that there's a whole page in the intranet dedicated to the program.   It mentions month guest speakers and lunches.   I also saw mention of a mentoring program.   Of course, the A/A happy hours important as well.   I'd like to know more. Anyway, the real reason I wanted to drop the line is to find out if you're spending all your time in Georgia, or if you want to grab lunch sometime this week or hear of any after work activities that would help in meeting other people at Enron.   You can reach me at 3-0472.   Later,Mat \n"

If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily print for April 8th.   If we do not change the model, I think we need another sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.   Of course, eventually we need to fix the model.Mat   Tom Halliburton02/02/20001 08:25 AMTo: Matt Smith/NA/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Interpreting Curves DataMatt,Here's a one page document showing how I have interpreted the curves data.

These 4 points are reported on the Northwest site, but do not appear in our PIPELINE_LOCATION table as of yet (hence the foreign key violation):458 OWYHEE COMPRESSOR - 355536111 NORTH DOUGLAS RECEIPT (20001) - 37032608 NOVELTY HILL M/S - (mkup one)612 FOUNDATION CREEK PLANT (20001) - 2603If we can get these matched to their IHS DRN counterparts, that would be great.   If not, we can make up the IHS number as we have in the past.Thanks,Chris\n"

      "body": "\nLeo,Well, actually that is how I spell my name as well...but not Enron - one of the drawbacks to working for a large company.   Your analysis of the database structure and its intent is correct.   The extra table enables the use of a many-to-many relationship between regulatory items and facilities.   Joanne and I previously discussed the need to \"keep track\" of all facilities referenced in a particular order.   This relationship allows users to query facility and review data related to an order.   For instance, if an order required the upgrade of chlorination facilities at several plants, one could develop a query and report that produced the results of all equipment inspections for the related facilities.   This would not be possible (or at least not achieved as easily) without the many to many relationship.   So yes, you are giving up functionality, so I would only consider eliminating the table if it would causing undo problems with the database.   As far as actually modifying the database, there would be some manual labor required for those orders with multiple facilities already assigned.   I have to go, but if you or Joanne need to discuss it over the phone, I'd be happy to with a little notice.   Mat\n"

I don't think I'm going to come now, so the time constraint is off. Matkathy.scully@milliman.com on 01/08/20001 02:20:41 PMTo: Matt.Smith@enron.comcc:   Subject: okay, i'm taking a break from trying to figure out this excel spreadsheet i'm working with.   it took me forever to remember how to use pivot tables.   it's pretty interesting though once i get past all the annoying parts.well, i really would prefer to explain my thoughts to you through another media (i.e., speaking to you), but i guess you need to know asap, so i'll attempt it through email (even though i HATE email for explaining my thoughts b/c there's always misunderstandings).   i guess the reason i'm very hesitant about you coming is b/c i don't know what you expect from the visit.   we both know things are obviously different b/w us more recently than they had been when you initially moved.   i'm not sure about the reasons you feel different about me, but i can attempt to explain the reasons i feel different about you.   first, we don't really see each other often and that obviously makes someone feel less for a person, regardless of who it is (you have agreed with this).   second, since i started my job and have other things going on in my life, i realized that nothing will happen with us and i don't like being emotionally tied to someone knowing nothing will happen.   so, i've tried to get rid of all my feelings for you.   also, i don't like limiting myself as if something will happen. i don't know about you, but regardless of how much we said we weren't anything and we were free to do what we want, there was still a limit on what we could do.   with us visiting each other (in more than a friendly way), i felt somewhat limited. by limited i mean i always felt i could not be even slightly serious with someone else with us visiting each other as more than just friends.   don't worry, there isn't anyone else, it's just the thought of feeling limited if the opportunity arises that i don't like (especially when i've realized it's hopeless to expect anything with us).   so, i guess the reason i'm nervous about your visit is b/c i think you would want it to be like our other visits (i.e., you stay over my place...in my bed...and we hang out together all weekend) where i don't think i want that.   i would like if you visited, but not how we usually visit.   those are my thoughts (although not clearly explained b/c of hte email thing).let me know what you think...\n"

The reason I feel bad is Jan was out today (she usually does Socal) and either Ted or I was going to fill in for her.   Neither of us wanted to do it, and Ted got stuck with it.   Well...I would have done it, but I was out until 2 am last night and I didn't want to fuck up because of it.   Socal can be high stress because there are huge time constraints and its the most expensive gas in the country.   Anyway, a bunch of shit got fucked up.   It's not Ted's fault, but he really had a rough day because of it.   I think I might have been able to do a better job, but I knew there was chance for error because neither of us have done it in a while.   I feel bad.   Regardless, I'm pretty whipped and am looking forward to going home.   Of course, I have a whole weekend of work to look forward to!

      "body": "\nPhillip,I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.   Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price curve to calculate the mark to market.   Then that day's transactions can be entered to calculate the P &amp; L of transactions which close out previous positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.   Initially, I thought that daily P&amp;L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&amp;L whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time value and storage costs would be included).   However, this only works if the person is 1000% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which require marking.   As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 1000% hedging, I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.   The main question I have is simply, \"Should I be calculating the P&amp;L for each person's storage book for open and closed positions?\"   Then beyond that, if we do calculate the P&amp;L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.   So, I guess I could apply the model for that purpose.   Does this make sense to you?   Any comments are appreciated.   Thanks.Mat\n"

The numbers in the Test Sheet for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for February 5th.   I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's website for the 5th.   Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.   It appears the Test Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.   However, the website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as late as 7 am (we are not sure why).   I understand you may pull the numbers from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers earlier.TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.   We pull the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.   It looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.   They differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the other.   To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.   The numbers for February 6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.   Is this a reporting or a scrubbing problem?   It is possible you are pulling the data from the website before they update it with the next day's data.   We manually type these numbers in.   If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would not be in when this report is run.El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant receipts.   The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because I don't think this is a cycle problem.General - The \"Difference\" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.   This can cause intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day fluxuations.   Any \"Difference\" column should compare identical cycles.   I suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day and the previous day.   This way we can compare identical cycles as well as pick up any intraday fluxuations.As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.   These notes should give us a great place to start.   I look forward to getting this report ready to use.Mat\n"
