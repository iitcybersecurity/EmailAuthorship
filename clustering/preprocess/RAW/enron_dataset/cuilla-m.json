      "body": "\nAmy and Alec are definitely welcome!   Actually we had already planned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.   We have a whole room to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.   I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.   Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.   As far as the bill just let me know what you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.   The food bill with tax and tip will be about $1,350.   We are very appreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.   However, we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.   Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents standards.   We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the difference.   Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.   The bottom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.   Our most   important concern is that all our family and friends to have a great time.   While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinner.   If you think they will please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey and I are.   Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick toast.   We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.   Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.   We haven't received a reply card as to whether he will be there or not.   As to this weekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.   I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could get a ride from him.   I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.   Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad to have all our family there to support us!   If you have any questions please call me tonight at the house.Sharon.Cuilla@nlrb.gov on 09/19/2000 12:57:000 PMTo: martin.cuilla@enron.comcc:   Subject: Plans   Hi Marty,   Amy and I were talking over the weekend and she said she did not plan   to attend the rehearsal dinner because there was no one to keep Alec.   Would you and Zooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for   dinner only and left as soon as they were through eating?   She said   she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or   Zooey to feel any pressure.   This is your special time and she doesn't   want to detract from it in any way.   I feel sorry for her missing out.   It is hard for Alec to be still and quite for very long but I think he   would be fine while we are eating.   Would you please talk with Zooey   and ask her how she feels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.   Amy   would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.   If you prefer   he doesn't come, just say so.   There will certainly be no hard   feelings over it.   I spoke with Betty Joyce Sunday and Julianna and her husband are not   going to be able to come.   Joyce, Chester, Renee, and Travis (her   boyfriend) are planning to arrive in Houston Friday afternoon the   29th.   Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and   should arrive early in the afternoon on Friday.   Mike decided to fly   and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.   There will be 9 or 111   (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal   dinner.   I know that is more that you had planned on but I will pay   for the extra people.   Why don't you call me when you have time and we   can talk about it.   Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.   She   called me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had   really wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to   come.   I'm glad I was able to work it out.   Grandma Ina will arrive here this week on Thursday.   It seems like I   remember you and Zooey were going to be in town this weekend for her   class reunion.   I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time   to come by, but if you do let me know when and we will plan lunch or   whatever.   If you have time you can see the new house.   It is looking   better every day.   Love,   Mom\n"

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 888 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.   So far things are looking good.   We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.   I wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.   After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical   moisture.City   \tForecast   Date \tMax   Temp\tMax Temp Deviation\tMin Temp\tMin Temp Deviation\tPOP (%)Houston\t09/20/000\t91\t 3\t70\t 3\t53Houston\t09/21/000\t86\t-1\t72\t 5\t52Houston\t09/222/000\t91\t 4\t67\t 1\t57Houston\t09/23/000\t93\t 6\t74\t 8\t52Houston\t09/24/000\t83\t-4\t67\t 1\t555Houston\t09/25/000\t80\t-7\t59\t-6\t27Houston\t09/26/000\t82\t-4\t58\t-7\t 7Houston\t09/27/000\t86\t 0\t61\t-4\t14Houston\t09/28/000\t86\t 0\t62\t-2\t26Houston\t09/29/000\t85\t-1\t64\t 0\t16Houston\t09/30/000\t86\t 0\t62\t-1\t16Houston\t10/01/000\t86\t 1\t64\t 1\t20\n"

We are on a very tight schedule so prompt attence is appreciated.   The location is the SE corner of Kirby and Westheimer.   If you are coming from 59 you turn left on Kirby (north) and go to Westheimer and turn right (east) and it is on your right.   Also, the rehersal dinner is following the rehersal at Buca di Beppo at around 7:30.   We hope you will be able to attend.   \n"
