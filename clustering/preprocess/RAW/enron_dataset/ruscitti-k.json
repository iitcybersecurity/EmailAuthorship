The parties agree that time is of the essence in this Agreement...3.   Add 4.2 to read as follows:   4.2   If Vector fails to purchase and receive from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under the heading \"Daily Price Survey\" under the listing applicable to Chicago and using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and receive from Seller for such day.4.

      "body": "\nStamos,I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get crushed this year.   There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase inplant shutdowns and company layoffs.   The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'llbe little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.   I feel we've just seen the beginning.   I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.   The crisis is not a short termproblem.   As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what wouldkeep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state???   If you own anyCA real estate, sell.   The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytimesoon.   So, how do impact demand???   You have to price energy(power/gas) so high thatthe discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cuttingback on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.   California will seethis reduction in demand over time.   If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses haveclosed their doors for good or moved to another state.   Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will gobankrupt within 2-3 yrs.   Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.   Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes onthe energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.   Take Care and thanks for the email.Kevin \n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nStamos,I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get crushed this year.   There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase inplant shutdowns and company layoffs.   The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'llbe little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.   I feel we've just seen the beginning.   I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.   The crisis is not a short termproblem.   As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and (2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what wouldkeep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state???   If you own anyCA real estate, sell.   The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytimesoon.   So, how do impact demand???   You have to price energy(power/gas) so high thatthe discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cuttingback on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.   California will seethis reduction in demand over time.   If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses haveclosed their doors for good or moved to another state.   Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will gobankrupt within 2-3 yrs.   Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.   Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes onthe energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.   Take Care and thanks for the email.Kevin \n"

I couldn't even see Kendall.I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try to sendit again if you can.   In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed - big time.I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.   If, like you said, noone really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.   It has the potentialto affect every person in the state.   Not only will consumers end up bailing out theutilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&amp;E - but it will likely preventmany new companies from setting up shop in California.   After all, who would wantto put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power interruptions while paying the highest utility bills in the country.   I think that the only way Californiawill come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for the foreseeablefuture.   I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the next couple years.But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.When do you start coming to Texas.   Let me know so we can try to hook up.   I'll talk toyou soon.   Kevin\n"

I personally think that the problem will come and go for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the situation.   I have no idea what they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.What's your time frame on a house?   If you're only concern is that prices are at their highest level in the last decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.   It's impossible to time the market -   who would've thought San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are also a lot of intangibles associated with home ownership as your aware of.   I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast of it.   Also, you could call me if youhave any questions.   I'll try to help the best I can.

I'mthinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.   Theyjust crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.   Any opinions?I start my Texas travel in February.   I'll be in Dallas for the first fullweek and back in March in Dallas again.   Starting the end of March I'll bethere almost every week for about 6 months.   You'll be seeing more of me thanyou want.   When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up somedates.Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.Take care, B\n"

As I'm sure you can relate to, the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money toward a house and savea lot of anger, frustration and stress.How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?   Have you been to many Bears games?

      "body": "\nThe following article appeared in today's Chronicle.Jan. 25, 20001, 10:59PMEnron rating setup irks many workers By L.M. SIXEL TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses they're expecting next month. Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits them against each other. Under the system, nicknamed \"rank and yank,\" employees will be put in one of five categories: 5 percent will be identified as \"superior,\" 30 percent will be labeled \"excellent,\" 30 percent will be called \"strong,\" 20 percent will be labeled \"satisfactory\" and 15 percent will be called \"needs improvement\" or \"issues.\" An insider said \"needs improvement\" means \"you have one leg hanging out the window.\" And \"issues\" is Enron lingo for \"you're gone.\" The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up with, are not based just on performance. Instead, they compare employee against employee. \"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current period if other employees' performance raised the bar,\" according to a memo from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that was distributed this month. While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also expected to be team players, according to the memo. `Horse-trading' of rank deniedThe problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another employee. An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the manager he is working for, the insider said. Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect of bargaining. She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many employees --- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. Some may not fit inSome people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in that environment. After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't do well in an entrepreneurial environment. Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. Several years ago, Houston Lighting &amp; Power put in a forced ranking system, dividing all employees into four groups, with \"1\" the top group and \"4\" the lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had T-shirts printed: \"Don't ask me --- I'm a 3.\" Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. But many of the employees --- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory --- won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. \"Employees understand that when it's explained to them,\" Olson said. ---To voice comments, telephone 713-2220-2000 and dial in code 10002.

This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the pricesensitive buyers cut back.   However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for   price caps, this won'thappen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probablyneed to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.   The other factor, of course, is that youcould have an increase in supply - new power plants.   But being that the amt. of time it takes to develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combinedwith the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supplydoesn't seem likely in the short term.

Between work, the wedding,and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been pretty stressed.As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down considerably.   We're only goingto have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.   For me that includes you of course, Moller,Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).   Don't tell her though, she's the onlyone I haven't mentioned anything to.   I'll make sure you and Moller get to share a room.   I feel kinda badabout not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like dealing with Kim.   She's really annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.We still plan on having it at the B&amp;B in Long Beach Island.   We'll have a catered dinner for about 45 folks.It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?   I'm psyched you'll be a lot closer.   Youcould swing over to Houston and check out the new house.   By that time we should have it in decent shape.We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.   It definitely needs a lot of work.   We'll be busy forthe next year working on it.   I think when it's done,   it'll look pretty cool.Anyway,   send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when you'll be back.   Take care andtell Marie we said hi.Kevin\n"
