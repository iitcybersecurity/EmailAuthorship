On May 15, 2000, we will be putting a new procedure into effect that will function similarly to the LAN change password procedure.   Passwords for DSS users will begin to expire in early June, and every 60 days thereafter.   You will be receiving 5 Password Expiration e-mails as the deadline approaches.   Each of these messages will notify you that your DSS password will expire in the specified time interval.These e-mails will be sent as follows:E-mail   #1 - 2 weeks before expiration date #2 - 1 week before expiration date #3 - 2 days before expiration date #4 - 1 day before expiration date #5 - The day the password expiresWe now have a new module that will allow you to change your password.   When this module is executed, a window will display which will prompt you for your current password, New password, and repeat New password.   There are certain criteria that the new password must meet for it to successfully change.   Follow the instructions on this window to choose a new password.   You may run this module anytime, but once you change your password, the module must be closed before it can be run again.Please Detach (double-click) the following module and save it in the location that you normally save your DSS modules/databases.   This may be on your hard (C:) drive or personal (H:) drive.   As long as you remember where it is, it really doesn't matter where you save it.   When the time comes, Execute (double-click) the module to change your DSS password.If you have any questions or problems, please call the DSS HelpDesk at x31555, option 6 OR Lotus Notes e-mail at GPG DSS.Thank you.\n"

Hostile environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude. \t\t\tFor example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects everyone in the office. And hanging around negative friends and family members can reinforce your own negative traits. (For example, your temper is under control as long as you are not around your older brother.) In addition, negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes and behaviors that they possess. It is true the company you keep is a reflection on you and can influence your behavior. Steer clear of negative environments and begin building a positive life. \t\t\t- CG, Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor   \n"

      "body": "\nHAVE YOU GUYS READ THIS STORY BEFORE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK?&lt;   26 Guards&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Here's a message that will bring chills. Have&lt; you ever felt the urge to&lt; &lt; pray for someone and then just put it on a list&lt; and said, \"I'll pray for them&lt; &lt; later?   Or has anyone ever called you and said,&lt; \"I need you to pray for me,&lt; &lt; I have this need?   Read the following story that&lt; was sent to me and may it&lt; &lt; change the way you think about prayer and also&lt; the way you pray. You will&lt; &lt; be blessed by this.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; A missionary on furlough told this true story&lt; while visiting his home&lt; &lt; church in Michigan. \"While serving at a small&lt; field hospital in Africa, every&lt; &lt; two weeks I traveled by bicycle, through the&lt; jungle, to a nearby city for&lt; &lt; supplies.&lt; &lt; This was a journey of two days and required&lt; camping overnight at the halfway&lt; &lt; point.   On one of these journeys, I arrived in&lt; the city where I planned to&lt; &lt; collect money from a bank, purchase medicine and&lt; supplies and then begin my&lt; &lt; two day journey back to the field hospital.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Upon my arrival in the city, I observed two men&lt; fighting, one of whom had&lt; &lt; been seriously injured.   I treated him for his&lt; injuries and at the same&lt; &lt; time talked to him about the Lord.   I then&lt; traveled two days, camping&lt; &lt; overnight&lt; &lt; and arrived home without incident.   Two weeks&lt; later, I repeated my journey.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Upon arriving in the city, I was approached by&lt; the young man I had treated.&lt; &lt; He told me that he had known I carried money and&lt; medicines.   He said,&lt; &lt; 'Some friends and I followed you into the&lt; jungle, knowing you would camp&lt; &lt; overnight. We planned to kill you and take your&lt; money and drugs, but just as&lt; &lt; we were about to move into your camp, we saw&lt; that you were surrounded by 26&lt; &lt; armed&lt; &lt; guards.'   At this I laughed and said that I was&lt; certainly all alone in that&lt; &lt; jungle campsite. The young man pressed the&lt; point, however, and said,   'No&lt; &lt; sir, I was not the only person to see the&lt; guards. My five friends also saw&lt; &lt; them and we all counted them.   It was because of&lt; those guards that we were&lt; &lt; afraid and left you alone.'\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; At this point in the sermon, one of the men in&lt; the congregation jumped to&lt; &lt; his feet and interrupted the missionary and&lt; asked if he could tell him the&lt; &lt; exact day this happened. The missionary told the&lt; congregation the date and the&lt; &lt; man who had interrupted told him this story:&lt; \"On the night of your incident&lt; &lt; in&lt; &lt; Africa, it was morning here and I was preparing&lt; to go play golf.   I was&lt; &lt; about to putt when I felt the urge to pray for&lt; you.   In fact, the urging of&lt; &lt; the&lt; &lt; Lord was so strong, I called men in this church&lt; to meet with me here in the&lt; &lt; sanctuary to pray for you.   Would all of those&lt; men who met with me on that&lt; &lt; day stand up?\"   The men who had met to pray&lt; together that day, stood up.&lt; &lt; The missionary wasn't concerned with who they&lt; were, he was too busy counting&lt; &lt; how many men he saw.   There were 26.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; This story is an incredible example of how the&lt; Spirit of the Lord moves in&lt; &lt; mysterious ways.   If you ever hear such&lt; prodding, go along with it.&lt; &lt; Nothing is ever hurt by prayer except the gates&lt; of hell.   I encourage you to&lt; &lt; forward this to as many people as you know.   If&lt; we all take it to heart, we&lt; &lt; can&lt; &lt; turn this world toward God once again. As the&lt; above true story clearly&lt; &lt; illustrates, \"with God all things are possible\"&lt; and more importantly, how&lt; &lt; God hears and answers the prayers of the&lt; faithful.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; After you read this, please pass it on and give&lt; God thanks for the beautiful&lt; &lt; gift of your faith, for the powerful gift of&lt; prayer and for the many&lt; &lt; miracles He works in your daily life...&lt; &lt;&lt; http:///profiles.msn.com.\n"

      "body": "\nWillie -Have I sent this to you before?&lt; This is a good one, let me know what you think!   I laugh every time I read&lt; it.&lt;&lt; Once upon a time, there lived a man who had a terrible passion for baked&lt; beans.   He loved them, but they always had   an embarrassing and somewhat&lt; lively reaction on him.&lt;&lt; One day he met a girl and fell in love.   When it became apparent that they&lt; would marry, he thought to himself, she'll never go through with the&lt; marriage with me carrying on like this, so he made the supreme sacrifice&lt; and&lt; gave up beans.&lt;&lt; Shortly after that they were married.&lt;&lt; A few months later, on the way home from work, his car broke down andsince&lt; they lived in the country, he called his wife and told her that he wouldbe&lt; late because he had to walk.   On his way home, he passed a small cafe and&lt; the wonderful aroma of baked beans overwhelmed him.&lt;&lt; Since he still had several miles to walk, he figured he could walk off any&lt; ill effects before he got home.   So he went in and ordered, and before&lt; leaving he had 3 extra large helpings of baked beans.   All the way home he&lt; putt-putted.   By the time he arrived home he felt reasonably safe.&lt;&lt; His wife met him at the door and seemed somewhat excited.   She exclaimed,&lt; \"Darling, I have the most wonderful surprise for you for dinner tonight!\".&lt; She put a blindfold on him, and led him to his chair at the head of the&lt; table and made him promise not to peak.&lt;&lt; At this point he was beginning to feel another one coming on.   Just as his&lt; wife was about to remove the blindfold, the telephone rang.   She againmade&lt; him promise not to peek until she returned, and away she went to answerthe&lt; phone.   While she was gone, he seized the opportunity.   He shifter his&lt; weight to one leg and let it go.   It was not only loud, but ripe as a&lt; rotten&lt; egg.   He had a hard time breathing, so he felt for his napkin and fanned&lt; the&lt; air about him.&lt;&lt; He had just started to feel better, when another urge came on.   He raised&lt; his leg and RRIIPP! It sounded like a diesel engine revving, andsmelled&lt; worse.   To keep from gagging, he tried fanning his arms awhile, hoping the&lt; smell would dissipate.   He got another urge, this was the real blue-ribbon&lt; winner, the windows shook, the dishes on the table rattled and a minute&lt; later the flowers on the table were dead.&lt;&lt; While keeping an ear turned in on the conversation in the hallway, and&lt; keeping his promise of staying blindfolded, he carried on like this forthe&lt; next ten minutes, farting and fanning each time with his napkin.   When he&lt; heard the phone farewells, he neatly laid his napkin on his lap and folded&lt; his hands on top of it.   Smiling contentedly, he was the picture of&lt; innocence when his wife walked in.&lt;&lt; Apologizing for taking so long, she asked if he had peeked at the dinner&lt; table,   After assuring her he had not peeked, she removed the blindfoldand&lt; yelled, \" SURPRISE!!!\".&lt;&lt; To his shock and horror, there were twelve dinner guests seated around the&lt; table for his surprise dinner party.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ---\n"

The template will be used for both June Hyperion entries that were made and need to be input into SAP for June, as well as for any manual entries that didn't get into June MSA or Hyperion but need to be reflected in SAP for June (an example would be an intercompany imbalance that didn't get corrected by June in Hyperion).   There are some Hyperion entries that were made in June that shouldn't go into SAP, such as entries that were made to record equity earnings in consolidated subs.   These specific entries were made for tax reasons, but going forward, SAP will record these entries automatically.   If you have any questions about whether or not a Hyperion entry should be included in SAP, please contact me or Cindy Morrow.There will be a box in Cindy Morrow's office to drop off any entries that need to be made.   We are requesting all manual entries converted from June Hyperion entries to be dropped off no later than noon on Thursday.   This will allow time for the SAP team to key in the entries prior to Saturday so the data will be in SAP when we get to work on Saturday morning.   Please include copies of the Hyperion entries and any other support with the SAP manual entries.   For any other entries that need to be made this weekend, we are requesting these to be dropped off as soon as possible after the Hyperion entries are converted and complete.I will be available the remainder of the week to assist anyone who needs help converting Hyperion entries to SAP, or preparing an entry that hasn't been reflected in either MSA or Hyperion as of June but you would like included in SAP for June.   Please call me or email me to set up a time.Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.Pam3-6595\n"

      "body": "\nDrink Plenty of Water\"&lt;&lt;   I've heard it. I've read it. As long as I have been running, it's&lt;   always been the same message: \"drink plenty of water.\"&lt;&lt;   All along most race courses are water stations, and most runners slow&lt;   down to drink a cup of cool water. Keeping your water level up iscritical&lt;   when you run. If you get slightly dehydrated, you will not run well. Ifyou&lt;   get moderately dehydrated, you will become disoriented. If you get&lt;   seriously dehydrated, you can die. It's serious business.&lt;&lt;   The first year I ran was 19991, and I was inexperienced (also younger,&lt;   slimmer, stupider, etc.) I passed water stop after water stop,&lt;   occasionally drinking a swallow or two. I felt good, and I wasn't goingto&lt;   waste&lt;   precious seconds drinking water, even though it was a hot, humid day.&lt;&lt;   Big mistake. As I neared the final mile, I \"hit the wall.\" My energy&lt;   level dropped to zero, I began having to walk some, and I realized Iwould&lt;   have to work hard just to finish. I did make it across the line, but only&lt;   with&lt;   a tremendous headache and hardly enough energy to walk. It was not much&lt;   fun.&lt;&lt;   I learned an important lesson that year. Stopping for water doesn't&lt;   actually slow you down. In fact, you will run a better race if you dodrink&lt;   water. The bottom line is that your body is simply not designed tofunction&lt;   without water.&lt;&lt;   In the same way, your spiritual stamina depends on stopping for regular&lt;   drinks of \"spiritual water.\" The dilemma for busy believers is finding&lt;   time to invest in reading the Word and meeting with God in prayer. Likethe&lt;   runner intent on reaching the finish line, we tend to put off those&lt;   regular drinks of water until we are totally parched.&lt;&lt;   But in the long run, you will run a better race if you will stop for&lt;   spiritual water. In fact, finishing the Christian race at all may&lt;   depend on it. And runners who don't ever slow down to take a drink often&lt;   stumble&lt;   off the course far short of the finish line.&lt;&lt;   In this year's race, I saw a man become dehydrated just a mile from the&lt;   finish. Strangely, he didn't seem to recognize that anything was wrong.&lt;   He was swaying from side to side as he walked, mumbling over and over,&lt;   \"I'm fine. I'm fine.\" He was so disoriented that he didn't even recognize&lt;   his own sick condition.&lt;&lt;   If you let yourself become spiritually dehydrated, you may not even be&lt;   able to recognize it. Stop today to drink some cool \"living water.\" For&lt;   serious runners, it's a must.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried&lt;   out, saying, 'If any man is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He&lt;   who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, From his innermost being&lt;   shall flow rivers of living water.'\"&lt;   John 7:37-38&lt;&lt;&lt;   Don't forget to pass this on!&lt;&lt;&lt;   brought to you by:Daily-Blessings&lt;&lt;   http:///www.daily-blessings.com/bless190p.htm&lt;&lt;\n"

In the alternative, they would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer subject to an appropriate protective order.Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC request for public information.DENA argues that only a   three month lag in the release of confidential information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.Only specifically named \"reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review the information.The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited commission action.   NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request expedited action due the financial implications and there is also considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending Commission guidance.\n"

The new number is 281-438-9638.   If anyone needs to&lt; contact me this is the number that they will be able to call.   Of course,&lt; for the next two weeks I will not be at that number over night because&lt; I'm waiting for the wedding date.   I will lease a suite for that two week&lt; period until the nuptuals are done.   I will also frequently check for&lt; messages so that if I'm not at the number when someone calls I can at&lt; least respond in a timely manner.   Feel free to call and leave a message&lt; for me at any time that you need.&lt;   Thanks for all that the two of you are doing for the Lord and the&lt; church.

I shall create a man foryou.\"\"\"What's a man, Lord?\"\"\"This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits.   He'll lie,cheat and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time.But...he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things.He will look silly when he's aroused, but since you've been complaining,I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs.He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting andkicking a ball about.   He   won't be too smart, so he'll also need youradvice to thinkproperly.\"\"\"Sounds great.\" says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. \" What'sthe catch, Lord?\"\"\"Well...   you can have him on one condition.\"\"\"What's that, Lord?\"\"\"As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring...

Corporate Accounts Payable is actively pursuing a \"Workflow\" system to route invoice images for approval and processing.   This workflow solution will not be implemented until early 20001.   In the interim, an approval process will be implemented by AP and Treasury to ensure invoices have proper approvals and correct general ledger coding.   Effective Monday, November 20 the following approval authorizations will be required for all invoices, payment requests and wire transfer requests that are $1,000,000 or greater:(A)   Those NOT approved by an underlying contract or RAC require two approvals:   a Managing Director approval of the payment, and an Accounting Director approval of the general ledger coding.   (B)   Those that ARE approved by an underlying contract or RAC require an Accounting Director approval of the payment   and general ledger coding.In both examples above, supporting documentation must be attached.   If not attached, then the payment will not be processed.To assist us with implementing this approval process, I'm requesting each of you to accumulate signatures of the Managing Directors and Accounting Directors in your business unit using the attached form.   Please forward this information to Larry Dallman (JFR568) by Friday, November 10th.This new process becomes effective Monday, November 20th.   It important to provide this information or payments greater than $1,000,000 will not be processed.\n"

She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of our church.   I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.   Like I breifly stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.   We try to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church, government and even our enemies.   Our meeting start at 7pm but we really don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us around that time that would be great.   We're all in this together if you hurt we hurt. : )I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with methis week.For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of alump I foundunder my arm.   As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and anultrasound ofmy breast.   Both test came back abnormal and   I am seeing a specialistthis week todetermine if I need to have a biopsy or not.Since God has given me the task ofdoing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.I trust and believe that God will heal.   God gave me a revelation severalmonthsago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited ourfamily,we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with youatthis time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gottenmad.   So hehas decided to try and pull me down once again.   I refuse to be broughtdown off thisspiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriorsI need you to be in prayer with me this week.   I see the specialist onThursdayand I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.God Bless Each of youandSeason's GreetingsLoveMarylyn___GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!Juno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!Join Juno today!
