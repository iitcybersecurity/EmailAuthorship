Could one of your guys call this guy and see if there is anything we can do to help him.   He is a friend of Doug's and will give us the business if we are competitive.   Supposedly he has a very favorable fixed price offter from a competitor, so I think it is a fishing expedition.Thanks,Tom---",

If we think there is real value here to ENA, I'd like to take this to execution asap. However, if we don't think we can/want to make these commitments, let's cut the cord and move on. The critical path item as I see it is what we want to do at Elba Island as far as offtake obligation. There is certainly substantial value here compared to the current gas index price embedded in the Elba tolling agreement. Jeff, depending on your schedule, you may want to try and attend.   Thanks.\n"

Technology has helped Enron create new=20\rbusinesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20\rresponsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.   You=\r=01,ve=20\rseen what technology can do at work.   Now we want you and your family to=20\rrealize its benefits at home.\r With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\rhe=20\rClickAtHome\rprogram, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20\rtechnology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=\r=20\rclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\r=20\rInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\r We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\r=20\rthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\r=20\rcase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\r=20\rcomputer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20\rClickAtHome includes the following:\r ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=\r=20\rdisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\r=20\rsoftware. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\r=20\rconnection, including broadband, where commercially available.\r? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\r=20\rand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\r=20\rhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\r,=20\rEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\raccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.   Eligibility includes being=20\remployed at the time of implementation. =20\r? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 20001, with delivery of=\r=20\rthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.   Delive=\rry=20\rof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 20001.\r Details about this program are still being finalized.   To address some of=\r=20\ryour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\r=20\rhttp:///clickathome.enron.com.   We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=\rar=20\rfuture where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20\rsubmit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20\r We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20\rfamily.   We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=\rl=20\rby creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=\r=20\rthe broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=\r=20\rEnron is a great place to work.\r\n"

Could each of you e-mail me a brief summary of your business in Florida- just give me a general idea of our level of involvement in your market, general themes we might want to get across, hurdles, etc. Ben/Jim, this may be a very good opportunity to have Kevin lay out our views/plans for deregulation and power development, and what we would like to see the Governor push in the state. Since Enron is in Texas (and the obvious connection with the Bush brothers), if it's appropriate to use Texas deregulation as an example/comparable with Florida, it might be interesting. If I could get your responses by next Wednesday am, they would be great. Thanks.---",

Last   year   the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were   the peakiest,   but   it reversed   this year   with   the   West   being highest   at the peaks   and in New England ---   but only   in early May 2000 were   hgih peaks   apparent   there.Demand   can vary from half the peak max   to the max.   Peakers   can be on the margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets.   We need to watch   gas prices   this   winter   as they can effect   winter peak power prices---not   just a   summer phenomenon.Where   are   the most gas plants   now on the margin?   Ercot, FRCC, Neepool, NYPP, SERC, WSCCA   DISCONNECTThere   is   a disconnect   in the on-peak forward market price for power in Texas now; with the   added   5 GW   Texas forward markets   do not seem to   take this   into account yet.   (Note:   Vince Kaminski) The   Texas forward   market   should be   very soft   next summer   unless   we return to   105 degree F   temperatures.   New England   is   just one year behind   Texas   in its overbuild.One main   reason for the   spikes   in Calif   is   power plants   did not   get   built in Calif   due   to   a lack of   a capacity   charge ...and   this is not a panacea...as Calif also   has   many   enviro/siting   hurdles   that challenge   developers   who want to site as well.   .TSUNAMI OF   MERCHANT   CAPACITY PLANNED?CERA   sees   over   240,000   MW   of planned   capacity over   the   2000-20005 period;   with   25,000 MW   being   completed   in   2000;   35 MW under construction   for   20001 and 15 000 MW under   construction for   20002---   but   the market   only needing   13 000   to   15 000 MW   a year.   This   shall   lead   to   many   and large deferrals and   delays, especially in   20001   and 20002.   What   has   been the recent   history?   US   wide   over thepast   3 years   just   111 percent of the planned   capacity   was   actually finished   and   18 percent   of that planned   was   actually   under construction.   They   assume   a   24 month   construction completion   time.FOR PROFIT   TRANSMISSIONCera   sees   Allegheny Energy   in PJM West;   Entergy in SPP;   Southern   in SERC   and Alliant   in MAPP   as all for profit transcos.TYPICAL   O&amp;M COSTS   IN U.S.   TRANSCOS Why   do   O&amp;M   costs   differ   widely   among   transcos?   Some   costs   are   3   to 8 times higher   than the norm   at $5000 in O&amp;M expense   per 5000   system   miles   in size.   Regulatory   overhang   allows   this...this is   weather   adjusted   to remove   high   costs   from   big   freezes   etc.USING REAL OPTION MODEL   VS   POWER PLANT   NPVYou   want to   try to have   the base value of   an asset   going   forward   when you expect volatility   and include   historical   spreads   and   fuel/power   price   swing   assumptions.CALIFORNIA   MARKET IS BROKENThis market   starts   to   work   only after it   gets into   a reliability crisis.   No incentives   to add power   plant   capacity   andhuge hurdles   against   siting   even when the market   signals the   need is   there.   Will the   regulator's post 2000   fix   make it   worse?PEAK POWER   DEMAND   FORECASTAs   percent   per year   change   vs   2000   Cera   sees   20001   as follows:New Eng   / New York 6.3 /   6.2   percentPJM / ECAR   7.7 / 4.4 percentMAIN /   MAPP   3.0 /   -0.1SERC /   FRCC   1.3 /   2.3   percentSPP /   ERCOT   4.0   /   2.3NWPP /   Rockies   -6.8   /   -0.6AZNM /   Calif-SoNV   -0.9   /   4.0USA   avg   up   2.6   percent   It   looks   like Calif. in in for a   touch summer   in 20001   as well.NATURAL   GAS   PART   TWOSUPPLY   SHORTYear   20001   supply   rebound could   be   8000mmcfd   to 1.0   bcfd;   Canada   in 20001   up only   4000   a   day; in the US   we   need   2   bcfd   more supply   for   20001   demand.   alone   let alone   storage   refill... yet   acold winter   now   could   add   3   to 4   bcfd   to demand   and slash   storages.

(\"DTI\") and its customers (and interested state commissions) continued to meet to discuss DTI's upcoming TCRA filing to be submitted to FERC on September 29, 2000.   The customers had numerous questions for DTI about why its upcoming TCRA filing will result in such a large rate increase, and advised DTI that it needed to provide more information to the customers before they could make a meaningful response to DTI's settlement proposal made on September 15, 2000.DTI opened the meeting by defending its upcoming TCRA filing as prudent, in accordance with FERC's prior orders on its TCRA mechanism, and legally defensible.   DTI then asked for responses to its settlement proposal made last week.   The basic feedback was that the customers \"were not there yet.\"   The customers said they were still interested in discussing settlement (in an effort to reduce the impact of the upcoming TCRA filing), but they wanted more of an explanation from DTI of its proposed substantial rate increase.Much of the customer's questioning focused on DTI's \"non-purchased\" fuel supply (i.e., fuel gas DTI has borrowed from storage) and the continued growth in this element of its fuel supply mix over the past few years.   As of June 30, 2000, DTI has borrowed approximately 23 Bcf from storage for fuel use.DTI also revealed that it had \"liberated\" approximately 13 Bcf of base storage gas over the last several years (i.e., reclassified base storage gas into working gas), and that this gas was \"still on the system.\"   DTI said it had a $0.31 per MMBtu basis in this gas and that it was hoping to save it for a future storage project.   The liberated gas had not yet been reflected by DTI in its FERC reports or accounts.   Arguably, this gas has been parked in space being paid for by the customers and the customers are paying DTI a return on this gas.During the bulk of the meeting the customers asked questions and DTI answered them.   DTI volunteered little; most information had to be extracted from its representatives.   The feeling of many of the customers was that DTI was not being forthright.At the conclusion of the meeting, the customers said they wanted to ask more questions and would present DTI with their questions in the near future.   Only after they have a better sense of the facts would the customers seriously entertain settlement offers.   Some customers expressed a desire for DTI to terminate its TCRA mechanism.   The customers also said the TCRA problems need to be addressed permanently so that there is not a \"TCRA crisis\" every year.Accordingly, DTI will make its TCRA filing on September 29, 2000 seeking a cost increase of approximately $65 million.   It appears that the customers will protest the filing and await FERC action on the filing and protests.   In the meantime, another meeting to discuss these matters has been tentatively set for October 18, 2000 at 9:30 a.m. in Washington.   The meeting may be cancelled if the parties do not believe it would be useful to help resolve the issues at that time.Please contact us if you have any questions about this matter.\n"

These events include customer and employee meetings, and trade shows.   ENA has made some modifications to the process, which are described in this memo.The $5,000 threshold remains in effect for all customer events.   However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $2,000, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $2,000 must be reviewed by the ENA Public Relations (PR) department and approved by the ENA Office of the Chairman2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.   Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require. The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and ENA.3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.   Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.   Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the ENA Office of the Chairman for final approval.Additionally, the PR department can assist in the procurement of tickets for various local sporting events and concerts.If you have any questions regarding this process, would like assistance planning an event, or need tickets for a Houston event, please contact Dorie Hitchcock in the PR department at (713) 853-6978.Thank you for your cooperation.\n"

EnronOnline's numbers are audited by Arthur Andersen on a periodic basis.An increased participation from the other platforms will allow these indices gain more credibility/appeal and encourage customers to settle on them.Please forward this email to appropriate people in your dept.If you have any questions on the above, please contact Rahil Jafry on 333206.Thanks,Dave\n"

Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hraway), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet othercommitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!!To refresh your memories,   the itinerary for the weekend is get to the parkFriday after school and set up before dark.   (For those who need to go downthere later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will beat the entrance to the park.)   Once we get there, the activities arebicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boysplaying grab-ass in general.   THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNERSATURDAY NIGHT,   A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT   ANDBREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.   For food purposes, we need to know an accurateheadcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help gettingyour bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer(or something).   We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lotterytickets, ... when we get there.   Maps for those who need them will beprovided next week.Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags,flashlights,lanterns, etc.   Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks.Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.   We'll make thefinal call on that by Thursday.To date, below is the headcount:   Friday Night   Saturday NightFallick   ?   ?Stehr   ?   YesByrd   ?

In September we will declare the viability of the project and thencreate a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone isDecember,\" Marsicobetre said.The Paria plant was expected to be operational by 20005, he said, adding thatthe consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco deltaplatform, south of Trinidad, to add a second and third train to the plant. \"InAugust a decision will be taken by the shareholders,\" he said.PDVSA would supply associated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also bea shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbean and theUnited States, he said.The Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States,Spain and Portugal.Marsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeking between $6 billion and $10 billion inprivate investment to develop the production of non-associated gas, its LNGprojects and the Venezuelan gas grid.Expanding non-associated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent ofthat total sum while the two LNG facilities would need some $2.6 million. Thecost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was notincluded in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters.\"If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment,\" Mava said.He said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with provenreserves of 146 trillion cubic feet (tcf), was counting on the development ofnon-associated gas to meet rising domestic demand.Venezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 20009, rising to4.2 billion cubic feet a day from the current level of 1.8 billion. That meantthe percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 555 percent from 42, Mavasaid.Of the current 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was associated and 14 non-associated.But there were unexplored reserves of non-associated gas of 6-20 tcf onshoreand 40-60 offshore, he said.(((Gillian Handyside.

American Gas Team\rE-Mail Category: Alert\rProduct Line: North American Gas ,\rURL: http:///www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=3D44487&amp;amp;m=3D1390 ,\r Alternative URL:=20\rhttp:///www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/1016000_16/nag_alt_1016000_16_ab.html\r***\r The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20\rsurface during\rthe relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=\rst=20\rweek.\rFrom mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=\ron=20\rof\rmild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=\r=20\rand a lack\rof storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market\rsomewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.000 in the cash market, less than=\r=20\r$0.20\rabove residual fuel oil. Last week, however, tragedy in the Middle East and=\r a=20\rslightly\rlower-than-expected storage injection report were sufficient to drive Novem=\rber\rHenry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.\r Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=\r=20\rexpect\rthe relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=\r=20\rmarket.\rTurmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=\r5=20\rBcf per day\rof potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return =\rto=20\rthe gas\rmarket should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil=\rd=20\rthrough\rOctober, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20\rtrillion\rcubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headroom for price is much=20\rgreater, as\rdistillate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse=\rlf=20\rin short\rsupply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=\r of\rdemand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distillate n=\ror=20\rshutting\rdown production comes easily or cheaply.\r Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=\rs\rjustifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20\rsignificant\rsettling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20\rsustained in the\rmid-$5.000s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=\r=20\rMore\rluck---a great deal more---would be required to restore a measure of calm to=\r=20\rthe gas\rmarket.\r Gas Storage---The Final Push\rOctober storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20\rapproximately 8.5\rBcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=\re=20\r5.5\rBcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=\r=20\rinjections\rof 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=\r=20\rfutures\rprices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=\r=20\rOctober. With\rthe beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20\rslowing of\rinjections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf---more tha=\rn=20\r1000\rBcf below the previous record low for the end of October.\r CERA expects that many storage holders---having begun the winter with record=\r=20\rlow\rinventories---will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=\rer.\rHowever, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20\rheating load\rfrom last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=\rh CERA\restimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=\r=20\ror even\rsubstantially slower (as occurred during 19998 and 1999), will keep=20\rinventories on a\rtrajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=\r=20\rwill\rremain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=\re=20\rpriced\rout of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=\r=20\roil.\rRegional Markets-Winter Rules\r The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =\rof=20\rwinter\rheating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=\rch\rRocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also\reased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20\rbetween\rboth regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=\rhe\rNortheast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =\rthe\rmagnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=\r=20\rof flows\ron Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=\rr=20\r(see\rTable 3).\r CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:\r * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry\rHub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the\rRockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the\rend of October and early November depending on heating load,\rbut in general strong regional demand will keep differentials\rwell below the ($1.000) per MMBtu summer level. CERA\rexpects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub\rduring November.\r * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies\rwill continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting\rflows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should\rfollow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general\rnarrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA\rexpects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu\rfor November.\r * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the\rPermian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should\rcontinue through November, with some slight widening in the\rMid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows\rcommence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.111) per MMBtu\rand ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.\r * Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline\rduring November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago\rcitygate market. However, the demand rebound that would\rresult from normal November weather this year would offset\rmost of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials\rwill average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when\rAlliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector\rPipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA\rexpects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per\rMMBtu.\r * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial\rrebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,\rbut there is little added delivery capacity into that market.\rCERA expects New York to price $0.666 above the Henry Hub\rduring November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.\r Canadian Markets---Supply Growth Still Uncertain\rThe supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20\runcertain. A\rline pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=\r=20\r2000-3000\rmillion cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=\rn=20\rthe\rpipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20\rquantities of\rgas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=\rs=20\rprecisely\rthe volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =\ris=20\ron par\rwith 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,5000 well completions in=\r=20\r2000,\rapproximately 8,5000 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20\rshallow trend\rdoes not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =\rto=20\rproduce\ra supply build by year-end and into 20001. For 2000, the total western suppl=\ry=20\rbuild is\rexpected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=\r=20\rgrowth of\r350 MMcf per day in 20001.\r Demand Slow but Exports Up\rTransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in\rOctober than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=\r=20\raccelerated;\reastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=\rnd of=20\rOctober.\rStorage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=\red\rstorage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20\rlevels.\rPG&amp;E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly\rbelow 1999 levels by 50-1000 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=\rer\rPipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=\rd=20\rto be\rslightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=\red\rwestern Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=\r=20\rCanadian\rdemand.\r High Prices, Wide Differentials\rThe AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low\rUS$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20\rOctober.\rFor November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=\rng=20\rAECO\raverage of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.000 per MMBtu).\r ***end***\r Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated tables.\r ***\rCERA's Autumn 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available at=\r=20\rhttp:///www.cera.com/event ***\r   ***\rAccount Changes\rTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mail\raddress, etc. go to: http:///eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfm   This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain information\rfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Review the dates on your products.We are in the process of converting \"regular\" products to \"Tokenized Reference Period\" Products.A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system sees as \"Day Ahead\", \"Month Ahead\", \"Month Ahead +1\", etc - but this is not what you or your customers see.   At midnight every night, the system checks the current date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For example, if Product #20451 is \"Month+1\", then on Feb. 28, the Short Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show \"April1-30\".   However, on March 1, the system will automatically change the date of Product #20451 to show \"May1-31\".   Note that the Product number stays the same, but the date has automatically updated.When all of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - your links all stay on the same relative date (links are between Product Numbers, not between Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it might look like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the same Product all the time - only the date changed).Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods will make your life easier in the long run - you will not have to continually create new Products and links. Links between Products which share the same dates should continue in effect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together.The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have Rolling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates will continue to change automatically on the 1st day of each new month.   For example:On Feb. 28, the \"Prompt Month\" product will be March; but on March 1, it will become April, etc.   On Feb. 28, the \"Prompt +1 Month\" product will be April; but on March 1, it will become May. etc.To verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a specific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st tab marked \"Product Details.\"   Your product will be \"Tokenized\" if it has the following applications:There will be a check mark   in the box after \"Lifespan Tokenized?\"The term \"Prompt Month\" or \"Prompt Month +1\" will be displayed in the next scroll-down box.If you have any questions about the set-up of your products, please contact the following members of the EnronOnline Product Control Group:Rob Cass x 35491Kevin Meredith   x 39555Melba Lozano x 58986Chris Walker x 375333\n"

There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, time frame and the critical nature of   the notices.   The cost is based on the number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months the cost would be approximately $3,000.   If you would like to check it out   I have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 111/5/000).

I've attached the latest overall schedule (rev 2,?and in a   earlier version of Excell so hopefully it can be easily opened).? Please   let me know if this is a format problem for anyone, I can fax it and/or mail it   if you'll let me know.?Basically the changes are that our games next week are   Tuesday (6:000 pm gametime?at Memorial Middle School field #3) and   Thursday (8:000 pm gametime at Spring Forest Field #2, our   regular practice field)? Also, I've upped the practice start time   next Saturday to 8:30 am going?till 10:30 (since our   game?Tuesday the 6th will?wipe out our practice)?and corrected   the error on the time for the March 10th practice (thanks Trisha).? If   these games are rained out they will not be made up.?By the way, I've got a practice scheduled for the March 10th   but I'm sure some will be out since that's the first part of SBISD spring   break.? Please let me know how many will be able to attend.?I don't think this really applies to anyone on our team, by   just fyi:? the league has requested that parents not drop their kids off in   front of the fields (by driving down the dirt trail).? There is too much   kid traffic and they're worried about accidents.? Just keep to the parking   lot.?See everyone this Tuesday at 7:30.?thanks,Jeff - RHounds_sched_rev2.xls\n"

This is what Alagasco shows we have regarding contract numbers and expiration dates:There are four   old CES/ Bring cotracts which have been assigned over to ENA.   They are:Bring reference number   #10170, volume of 20471 expires 12/31/000   (has associated demand fees)   Alagasco ref # ---   ENA No. 2,   Sitara #-2500042Bring Reference number   #1000555, volume of 1000 expires 111/30/000 (has associated demand fees)   Alagasco ref # --- ENA No. 1,   Sitare #-2500050These are the only   two contract Alagasco wants to terminatein accordance with the expiration date.   In additon we have two other old Bring/CES contracts that have expiration dates in 20001 and 20002 that   they have no intention of   terminating, unless however ENA would allow them to which we would not since they have demand fees with escalators associated with them.   They are:Bring reference number #10219, volume of   53339, expires 10/31/01   (has associated demand fees)   Algasco ref # --- ENA No. 3, Sitare #250196   Please note that in the system we have the termination date is correct but the volume is incorrect.   It reflects 10,000 and you can see that the date ranges have been split   each monthby   Joe Casas, whom   changes the volume in the scheduled section to 6,045 to account for fuel and what Alagasco is actually taking.   This needs to be corrected.   .Again, Alagasco has no intention of terminating this contract.Bring reference number #10326,   volume of 10,000 during the winter only, months Nov - March , (has associated demand fees)   Algasco ref # --- ENA No.4This deals expires October 31, 20002.   Sitara # ---250186   This is the contract that allows Alagasco swing rights in which they have yet to exercise. AT one point Scott Neal had mentioned to try to work on taking this swing language out of the contract but I have not mentioned anything to them since they have yet to exercise   those swing rights and I did not want to bring it to there attention.   I do not know how much the demand fees are on this cotnract , but I would assume they are signficant.Alagasco has sent   two termination letters to cancel the first two above contracts, only.   i.e.--- Bring ref #'s   10170 &amp; 1000555.   ENA does reflect these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two termination letters Alagasco sent us.   In additon, the two seasonal contracts that were done in Apirl &amp; May 000   between Roger and myself, Sitara deals 242653 &amp; 271301; Algasco   would like to tie these contracts   to the newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agree with.All deals look accurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare # 250196, which I mentioned above.   I do not know the demand fees associated with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system accurately or if they are being billed accurately.Cindy, I think this information should be everything we need to clear up the confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton letter.   Please get with me once you have a minute.   Thank you.\n"

When opening dates are more clearly definedand we have confidence in energy curves for those markets, then we could revisit thisarea of your energy profile. Natural Gas:Bunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term supply and transporation agreements which have effectively managed your price/therm.   For those reasons, the opportunities are very limited for Enron to apply a consolidation approach and providecompelling additional value for Bunge.As we agreed in January, the first objective was to define the potential for mutual valueand then decide what, if any next steps were appropriate.   I regret we will not be able tohelp Bunge at this time, but know that Enron will remain interested in assisting yourcompany in the future if and when market conditions afford us that opportunity.   Please feel free to contact me at any time in the future if I can help answer further questionsfor you or others who have been involved in this process.   Dick, thank you again for providing your time and attention to this inquiry process.   Sincerely,Gary Mirich\n"

We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing for index minus $0.0005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.0005 for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and submitted upon execution of the long term paper.If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all future deals in a similar manner.George x3-69992---"

Celeste Roberts, who handled many facets of the Associate and Analyst Program will now focus primarily on Recruiting.   I am responsible for staffing, rotation management, and performance management reporting directly to Charlene Jackson.   Going forward, I will partner with the PRC Representatives and Human Resources to work through our mid-year and year-end performance management process.   There are just a few remaining tasks necessary in order to bring our mid-year effort to a close.   As we are getting inquiries from Supervisors, Associates and Analysts regarding mid year ratings, we strongly encourage you to communicate final ratings to the Supervisors by no later than Friday, August 111, 2000.   As was discussed in the PRC meetings in July, Managers have been given until September 15 to conduct performance reviews.   If you need our assistance in communicating information to the Supervisors, please let me know and we will provide ratings where requested on your behalf.Additionally, as we introduced a new process during our mid year review efforts, it is crucial that we solicit your feedback.   To assist in this effort, we have identified an Associate and Analyst PRC Project Team.   Please look for an evaluation form via email in the next several weeks that requests feedback on how well we delivered our mid year process and how we might improve.   We our counting on your partnership and candid feedback.   Once again, the Associate and Analyst Program Management Team would like to thank you for your involvement in the performance review process.   I can be reached at 713-853-7351.   My assistant is Constance Charles and she can be reached at 713-853-5614.   I look forward to working with each of you.\n"

As we have discussed...effective Sep 13th,   Anita will make the adjustments to Enron's inventory and pad gas to reflect the February 26th results.I talked with Gary Wilson, and he confirmed that the revised values are correct.   Attached is a spreadsheet that contains the values.The correction to the working gas includes TWO corrections.   The results of the February 26th test reduces the working gas by 398,487MMBTU.   In addition, there is a reduction of 222,101MMBTU which is the difference between the SCADA values (Best Available) that Anita showed on the February 29th Storage Sheet and the \"official\" February 29th values that Gary Wilson received from MIPS.To summarize: Enron's pad gas will now be 3,9993,310MMBTU, instead of 4,2223,000MMBTU. Enron's working gas will be reduced by 420,5888MMBTU.Call me if there are any questions.\n"

Can we say that for each of the spot gas sales that you made to Triad, Triad would have called you (or someone else with ENA) first, and that you would have taken the call in Houston?   I am assuming that this is probably the case, but I would like to get confirmation from each of you.   2.   Did Sherwood Purnell or anyone else from Triad ever come to Houston to meet with either of you (or anyone else with ENA of whom you are aware)? 3.   Are there any other contacts between Triad and Texas that either of you are aware of? Many thanks for your usual quick response. Britt P.S. to Becky---I think you had some questions for Credit about how much is owed.   Can you please flange that down today or tomorrow?   I want to get the petition filed this week. \n"

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that   they have notbuilt such a vessel.   It is estimated that construction of such a vessel would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required operational and environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.   Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,http:///www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htmPlease let me know if any further research is needed.Charlie Weldon\n"

      "body": "\nlooks good to me.Sean Boyle@ENRON02/26/20001 05:36 PMTo: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Guaranteeing Index Minus Gas   Scott,I am talking to DTI (CNGT) regarding an Index minus sale for April-01 through   June-01 of up to 4 Bcf.   I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbedding an option.   I am not supposed to know about DTI's potential purchase requirements, so I changed the quantities and months in the example below, since the plan is to take this to her boss.Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it better.Tammi,As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guarantee you IF-FOM Index Gas you can take to Michelle.Example:   Note: All prices are notional non-transactable numbers.   DTI requires a total of 610,000 DT in April and May as a 10,000 DT/d baseload purchase.ENA Proposal would guarantee DTI IF-FOM Index Minus Gas by embedding an option (Put or Call) into the deal for say 5,000 DT/d.Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915,000 DT (in the case of the put) or as little as 305,000 DT (in the case of a call) then ENA can take the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas.Let us say; ENA is currently offered at IF - CNG App Index for   April and May @ Index +2 cents, and agrees to sell DTI Index   -2 cents; ENA has lost 4 cents or $0.04 * 610,000 = $24,4000.However, if we price in the value of a call option with a strike price of the FOM Index, then that would generate $0.10 * 5,000 * 61 days= $30,5000. ENA would use this value to offset the Index loss and make a small margin on the sale.   Therefore DTI is guaranteed Index minus gas, however must have the flexibility to potentially take more or less gas than the baseload quantity.   Remember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI will receive only the baseload quantity.   If ENA exercises the option everyday then DTI will receive the quantities mentioned above still at a price of Index -2 cents.This can work if you need a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed the option in three of the months and buy or sell the remainder in the fourth month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month period.   Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option will generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guarantee. Please let me know if you have any questions.   If you would like me to do a conference call with Michelle just let me know.Thanks,Sean\n"

Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hraway), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet othercommitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!!To refresh your memories,   the itinerary for the weekend is get to the parkFriday after school and set up before dark.   (For those who need to go downthere later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will beat the entrance to the park.)   Once we get there, the activities arebicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boysplaying grab-ass in general.   THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNERSATURDAY NIGHT,   A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT   ANDBREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.   For food purposes, we need to know an accurateheadcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help gettingyour bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer(or something).   We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lotterytickets, ... when we get there.   Maps for those who need them will beprovided next week.Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags,flashlights,lanterns, etc.   Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks.Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.   We'll make thefinal call on that by Thursday.To date, below is the headcount:   Friday Night   Saturday NightFallick   ?   ?Stehr   ?   YesByrd   ?

Let's plan on acaravan to the campsite from Butch Butcher's house.   Let's meet therearound 2:000 pm.   If you can't leave at that time (earlier or later),information on the campsites are available at the park entrance under\"Wilchester Indian Guides/Butcher\".   Depending on the outcome of the gameFriday night, an earlier caravan may be going Saturday morning.   Stay closeto your phones.As mentioned in earlier memo,   we will provide food for Saturday night (hamburgers and fixin's for the boys).   If   Dads want something other than aburger, please feel free to bring a steak to throw on the grill.   We willalso provide food for Sunday breakfast.   Please feel free to bring whateversnacks or drinks you want as well.   Remember to bring bikes, fishing stuff(optional), sporting goods, bug spray, camping stuff (I'm bringing an extratent), cards, lottery tickets, ...   If you need help getting your bike tothe park, call Butch (professional mover).Oh yeah, Directions (if you miss the caravan):From US-59, take Grand Parkway (TX-999)/Crabb River Rd exit and proceedSouth on Crabb River Rd.   Continue over RR tracks on TX-762 for about 15miles and take left into Brazos Bend State Park entrance.From Clear Lake area (who's coming from Clear Lake ?) take either FM-517 orFM-528 to TX-35.   Proceed to FM 1462 west.   Take a right on TX-762 and thePark entrance is about 1 mile on the right.Yah-teh-hay!DB\n"

I have only researched the requests that have to do with Recall, Right to do Partial day Releases and Partial Day Recall. As you know, these have   been added to a Two day BPS meeting in Colorado Springs next week (OCT 10 &amp; 111),   which I will be attending. At the last EC meeting the LDC's wanted this issue sent to FERC, By GISB, as an issue that needs further clarity from FERC before standards can be structured. The EC asked for guidance from the members and it was suggested by the EC members to send this issue back to the BPS committee for further discussion, with a commitment from the LDC's to have parties in attendance. Then BPS was to present a report, on progress, to the EC at the OCT 13th meeting. In my report I have Questions that are asking for guidance from management of any changes to our historical policy on Capacity Release and GISB standards.\n"

In the past, we have been against partial day recalls of capacity; however, with the growing need for on peak, off peak service, have we changed our stance?   There are obviously pros and cons to both approaches---we just need to agree on what we want our official stance to be.   Please advise ASAP.---"

Her initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a follow-up rotation in the back room.   However, she would like to do her initial trading-track rotation in the middle-marketing group.   She would be supporting the New York office (in Houston) where she would be assisting Per Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commodity hedge funds.   I think this rotation would be very valuable in her trading-track rotation.   After her rotation in this group, she would then proceed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.   Since those of you noted above had already agreed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato asked me to secure your agreement for this change.   He is agreeable provided those of you noted are in agreement as well.   The middle-marketing group would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feel this rotation would be very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.   If I do not receive an objection by Thursday, 5:000 P.M. - I will assume we can proceed ahead.   Thanks for your cooperation.\n"

The short list is 6 companies, not 5.   Out of 12 companies, 8 responded and we were second the last.   NIMO was disappointed that more companies did not bid on their RFP.   I asked if an extra $2MM would have pushed us into the short list.   NIMO said yes but it would still not be the highest bid.   Our bid was $4.9 MM.   I think we may have undervalued the CNG transport, storage optionality and the TGP Zone 5 deliveries into NIMO (new interconnect).I have forwarded the peaking proposal to Mark Breese last week and he is working on it.   Let me know if you have any questions.Sean Boyle08/17/2000 111:21 AMTo: Ed McMichael/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phil DeMoes/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Feedback from NiMoI spoke to Bruce Garcey at NiMo regarding their RFP.   Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who all bid higher than ENA.   However, he also mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the fifth highest bid. He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid.   He also said that the other five companies making the short list all proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure.   NiMo released an additional RFP for peaking supplies for this winter, I believe Phil should have or be getting that RFP.   Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP.Thanks,Sean\n"

I sent out a mail about this site before, about a month ago, let me explain the situation again.It is weird that this web site uses such a long line as the URL link for their critical notices, but Lotus notes can only take the first line starting with http:/// as the hot link, this is why you seeonly the first line was underlined as the link. When you click the partial URL link, of course you'llget an error. To work around this you need to copy the whole five lines, open your IE and pasteit to the address box and press \"Enter\". Let me know if there is still a question.

I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her and I agree with your comments. Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought might be helpful to them.   2 books that I think are very good   are 1) Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.   This is textbook type reading that is the best book on options that I know.   2) Reminisences of A Stock Operator by   Edwin Lefevre.   This is the best book on trading that I have read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).   It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 19000's.   A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.Sincerely,Scott NealChip Ryan &lt;cryan@lsu.edu&lt; on 10/19/2000 07:30:58 PMTo: gdilli2@enron.com, sneal@enron.comcc:   Subject: RecruitingHi Geynille and Scott,I wanted to thank you for lunch today and tell you how much I enjoyedmeeting you.   Input from professionals such as yourself helps us to makeour classes more relevant and offer better advice to our students.   Weappreciate that you are willing to take the time to make this valuablecontribution.One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, dropped by to see met later inthe day to tell me about her Enron interviews.   Milagros was very excitedabout Enron and impressed with all of the people she had met.   I want tooffer an unsolicited recommendation on her behalf.   Milagros is one of themost impressive students I have ever taught.   While her GPA (3.9) issufficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to comment on herintangible qualities.   Milagros is mentally tough, hard working,determined, and ambitious.   Just as important, she is a genuinely niceperson.   She deals with people very well and possesses what I woulddescribe as quiet leadership characteristics.   In other words,   she leadsby example and by reason.   I also find her to be mature beyond her age andwilling to assume responsibility for her own choices.   In short, I thinkMilagros would be an asset to any organization.Again,   it was good meeting you.

The problems started at 8:30 PM when one of the 5000 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2 other lines went down as well, all in the Comahue-BsAs corridor. All 3 incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high tension towers were sawed.In addition to the transmission lines sabotage, at 10:000 PM, one of the Nuclear plants suffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW.This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finally went out of service as well at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW.As a result of all the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 111:000 PM.Transmission lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday.For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish).Julian\n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nThank you for the info.   I call if I have questions after I review further. \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Rebecca W Cantrell   02/01/20001 05:53 PM To: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Tennessee Purchase of Physical GasScott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.   There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about financial transactions.   I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against them too much.Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to maintain system integrity.   And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.   They no longer have a fuel tracker.   Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.   The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.   They do, however, have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases they make for balancing.   If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.   Purchases made for system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed in the next rate case.   Fifth Revised Sheet No. 209A   Schedule LMS - MA   Load Management Service - Market Area (continued)   (ii)   Operational Transactions:   Operational Transactions are those   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales which Transporter may from   time to time, in its discretion, enter into with third parties to   balance Transporter's system and to maintain operational integrity.   Pursuant to this Section 7(g)(ii),   Transporter may purchase gas   quantities for receipt into its system and may sell gas quantities for   delivery out of its system.   These Operational Transactions may be   conducted on a first-come/first-served basis at posted prices, or   pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading system, or   negotiated directly with third parties.   The Operational Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout   Activity pursuant to Section 7(g)(i) Item No. 2 of this Rate Schedule   must occur during the Annual Cashout Period; provided, however, that   if the quantity of Operational Purchases or Operational Sales, as   applicable, is insufficient to offset the quantity of Net Cashout   Activity, then an additional month of Operational Transactions, ending   on September 30, thirteen months after the start of the Annual Cashout   Period, shall be included in the Cashout Report in order to reconcile   Net Cashout Activity.   Gas quantities from an Operational Transaction   which are used to offset Net Cashout Activity in one Cashout Report   cannot be used to offset cashout activity in a subsequent Cashout   Report.   (ii) Annual Cashout Report:   Transporter shall include in the Cashout   Reports filed pursuant to this Section 7(g) monthly detail for Item   Nos. 1, 4 and 5 as described in Section 7 (g)(i).   Such detail shall   include a listing of monthly imbalances in dekatherms   and dollars by   cashout shipper in support of the cashout activity in the report.   Transporter will include a list in the Cashout Report of all   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales transactions by month   during the applicable Annual Cashout Period, plus the additional month   provided pursuant to Section 7(g)(ii), if applicable, and will show   the derivation of the weighted average price of the Operational   Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout Activity for the Annual   Cashout Period as described in Item No. 2 in Section 7(g)(i).   In   addition, Transporter shall include in the Cashout Report detailed   support for any required Balancing Entry, Balancing Entry Pricing and   Balancing Entry Pricing Adjustment pursuant to Item No. 3 of Section   7(g)(i) of this Rate Schedule.\n"

However, Scott says that he was given 3 weeks vacation (120 hours) as part of the CES acquisition.   His offer letter does not state the 120 hours up front, but we can add this to his balance and correct the problem, if you approve.

Terra Resources reduced their purchasing signficantly for the month of June, supposedly they bought no spot gas at all only term commitments.   There total load is around 2000,000 but I do not know the mix up between spot and term.   Also CF Industries and Farmland (which are small gas buyers) reduced their volumes as well.   PCS initially reduced their voumes for thier Geismer facility but when gas prices dipped to upper 3.90s and low 4.000's they came in and bought the supples they had curtailed and are at max volumes.Thanks.\n"

I sent you an email a few weeks ago, but perhaps youdidn't receive it.   No big deal.I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.   My lastsemester is shaping up to be pretty tough.   The MBA class in Real Optionsis, to say the least, tough!   I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, andso far we've learned about Binomial trees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model,risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processes, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo,and pricing American, European, and exotic options.   What's also greatabout the class is that our professor constantly uses Enron as an exampleof how this stuff works in the real world.   It's a great class!One of my other classes, Economic Forecasting, is challenging as well,because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time.Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I needto be doing.I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlightinglines on every page!   I figured I'd start with the less technical booksfirst, considering my workload.I'm going to be in Houston looking for apartments this weekend, 3/9 - 3/111with my roommate, Ed Brady, who will also be at Enron in July.   Let me knowhow your schedule looks, and maybe we can get together.Hopefully my getting into your fundamentals group or the new tradingrotation that you spoke of is still a high probability.

The database for September is now ready for viewing.   Just as a reminder, this is the shortcut on your desktop called \"Statistical Database\".

Please review the analysis for September 2000 and provide explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, quarter/quarter, and month/month variances.   The current objective of Investor Relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and presentations.   It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial personnel.Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail to me by 3:000pm Tuesday, October 10th.

The first Super Saturday weeke=\rnd=20\ris the weekend of October 27th and 28th.   We have undergone a rigorous=20\rinterview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&amp;selling=01=\r8=20\rcandidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.   Students will=\r=20\rarrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.   We have=20\ractivities planned for the entire weekend.   The goal is to implement a Supe=\rr=20\rSaturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=\r=20\rwhile also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20\remployees.   To that end, we have made the following changes:\rFriday Evening Dinner.   The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =\r =20\rWe will provide transportation for all candidates.   We will continue to hav=\re=20\rsmall tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=\rnd=20\rfour (4) students.   There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant=\r=20\rbefore the dinner.   This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=\rte=20\rmore students.   It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20\remployees.\rSaturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=\r=20\r(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20\rfacilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.   We=\r=20\rhave allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20\rfacilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20\rinterviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil=\rl=20\rrotate.=20\rIn prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20\rInterviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.   The remainder of=\r=20\rthe time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that=\r=20\rall interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation=\r=20\rforms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20\rDecision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on=\r=20\rMonday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20\rfollowing the interviews and lunch.   The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P=\rM=20\rto 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag=\rement=20\rteam.   Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.

        " Scott Neal/HOU/ECT on 03/07/20001 02:43 PM --- \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Rebecca W Cantrell   02/01/20001 05:53 PM To: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Tennessee Purchase of Physical GasScott, this is all I could find about Tennessee's right to buy system gas.   There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at all about financial transactions.   I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against them too much.Basically, Tennessee can buy or sell gas as required to balance and to maintain system integrity.   And they can buy or sell it either (1) on a first come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.   They no longer have a fuel tracker.   Since they are supposed to be retaining fuel from their transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.   The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so Tennessee would not be required, absent a tariff provision, to post or report its purchases from affiliates at the time it does them.   They do, however, have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases they make for balancing.   If one suspected they had overpaid their affiliate for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the issue could be raised in the cashout report proceeding at FERC.   Purchases made for system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be addressed in the next rate case.   Fifth Revised Sheet No. 209A   Schedule LMS - MA   Load Management Service - Market Area (continued)   (ii)   Operational Transactions:   Operational Transactions are those   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales which Transporter may from   time to time, in its discretion, enter into with third parties to   balance Transporter's system and to maintain operational integrity.   Pursuant to this Section 7(g)(ii),   Transporter may purchase gas   quantities for receipt into its system and may sell gas quantities for   delivery out of its system.   These Operational Transactions may be   conducted on a first-come/first-served basis at posted prices, or   pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading system, or   negotiated directly with third parties.   The Operational Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout   Activity pursuant to Section 7(g)(i) Item No. 2 of this Rate Schedule   must occur during the Annual Cashout Period; provided, however, that   if the quantity of Operational Purchases or Operational Sales, as   applicable, is insufficient to offset the quantity of Net Cashout   Activity, then an additional month of Operational Transactions, ending   on September 30, thirteen months after the start of the Annual Cashout   Period, shall be included in the Cashout Report in order to reconcile   Net Cashout Activity.   Gas quantities from an Operational Transaction   which are used to offset Net Cashout Activity in one Cashout Report   cannot be used to offset cashout activity in a subsequent Cashout   Report.   (ii) Annual Cashout Report:   Transporter shall include in the Cashout   Reports filed pursuant to this Section 7(g) monthly detail for Item   Nos. 1, 4 and 5 as described in Section 7 (g)(i).   Such detail shall   include a listing of monthly imbalances in dekatherms   and dollars by   cashout shipper in support of the cashout activity in the report.   Transporter will include a list in the Cashout Report of all   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales transactions by month   during the applicable Annual Cashout Period, plus the additional month   provided pursuant to Section 7(g)(ii), if applicable, and will show   the derivation of the weighted average price of the Operational   Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout Activity for the Annual   Cashout Period as described in Item No. 2 in Section 7(g)(i).   In   addition, Transporter shall include in the Cashout Report detailed   support for any required Balancing Entry, Balancing Entry Pricing and   Balancing Entry Pricing Adjustment pursuant to Item No. 3 of Section   7(g)(i) of this Rate Schedule.\n"

For those of us who believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me   give you a little history lesson. You'll see that it can get a lot worse   than this.For our little history lesson we'll focus on the S&amp;P 5000, because that   pretty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has had   it a lot worse --- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's fairly   concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent commentaries   the NASDAQ will get its turn in the historical spotlight.Over the last two quarters   the S&amp;P 5000 lost 19.23%. As horrific as that has been, that actually only   ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 18000. Believe it or not,   there have been 777 that were worse.There were eight six-month   periods in which the S&amp;P 5000 lost more than 40%. There were 18 in which it   lost more than 30%. The very worst single six-month period was the one ending   May, 1932, in which the S&amp;P 5000 lost an astonishing 52.92%.Of the 777 six-month periods   worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 19000, and none of them were   during the Civil War. 333 (including the very worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the   Great Depression that followed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929.   The worst six-month period   in the modern era ranks 13th overall. It was the one ended September, 1974, with   the S&amp;P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 1970s. The most recent period worse   than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the one ended March, 19888, with the   S&amp;P down 19.56%. That means that in the 19990s there were no six-month   periods worse than the most recent six-month period. This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no   means as bad as it could have been, or could still be. But at the same time it   shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&amp;P 5000 has   done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 2000 years. But   don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. It can. Of the 777 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&amp;P   went down further during the next six months 24 times --- losing an   average of an additional 18.24%. Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 chance   of things still getting worse over the next six months. But of course the good   news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things getting   better. But not that much better. Over the 53 times the S&amp;P rose over the   next six months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happens now   over the coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% loss of   the last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding losses.   If you start with a dollar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents   left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. History class dismissed. Oh, and there will be a test tomorrow... (and every   day).   - TOP.GIF - BOTTOM.GIF - audio.gif - vid.gif\n"

I am trying to highlight---where the lawyer indicated---the attempts to safeguard and promote US investment in Argentina,   the rapport I had with the various echelons of authority in that country, and shed light on character and ability.   Please feel free to add/delete as you see fit and advice of any comments and/or suggestions.   Needless to say, and regardless of outcome, I really appreciate your help and advice.

We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.   Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile.   We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.   We paid $9.000/box for shells.   We aleady had our guns,   however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day.   We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of fall and we slayed the birds.   I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.   The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $2000 and takes about an hour.You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.   I think he is affiliated with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.   I hope this info is helpful.

He is going to get me the names of some people he huntedwith to compare prices, accommodations etc.   A few things he wanted us tocheck on; 1) BA is a hell of a long way to travel - is the flight bus. class? 2) What time of year are you planning on going - there are better times.Scott was thinking they hunted in May (he is going to check) and had as muchshooting (and then some) as he needed. 3) Accommodations in BA and where you hunt.   Again he is going to verify andget some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting(not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking hestayed at the Gauge Four Seasons.I will get back to you with more details as I have them.Thanks, Lee - 713-624-9065 (lhanse@br-inc.com)--- Original Text ---From: \"Boyd, Bruce\" &lt;Bruce_Boyd@kindermorgan.com&lt;, on 2/111/20001 111:111 AM:Are you up for a hunting trip of a lifetime?Pawpaw and I met with an outfitter last week to discuss details of a dovehunting trip in Argentina. In a nutshell, the trip includes six (6) shoots(i.e. half day hunts) near the town of Cordoba, Argentina. As Jody canattest, there is no limit and you can shoot 4000 to 1000 birds per daydepending on how mad you are at them!I have estimated the total cost of the trip at $5,000. This price includesthe following:3 nights &amp; 4 days (6 shoots) @ $2,295 (at Presidential Estancia)Roundtrip airfare (Houston-Miami-Buenos Aires-Cordoba) @ $1,000 (could be aslow as $8000)Shells ($9.75 per box) @ $1,000 (based on 320 birds per shoot...75% killaverage)Gun permits, bird boys, entertainment in Buenos Aires, etc. @ $705We need at least 4 to book a separate trip. Argentina's seasons are oppositefrom ours and the best time to go is August - October. A smaller group willbe booked to go with an other group.I know all of you boys got huge 2000 bonuses...so what's a paltry $5 largefor a trip like this?Let me know if you are interested in going with us so we can start lookingat dates. If you have any questions call Pawpaw or myself. See ya.\n"

The filingwas made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in FERC's Order 637, whichencourages companies to voluntarily submit ```new and innovative approaches''' to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance filing made June 15.```Under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,''' said Carl Levander, vice-president ofRates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmission. ```Even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties oftenwait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the current process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the auction isclosed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid.'''According to Levander, Columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes intoconsideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-termcontracts.Under Columbia's proposed ```bid/offer''' system, Columbia would ```offer''' (via its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm capacity.Customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding. If Columbia offers discountedcapacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate. Or, if Columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with adifferent term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding. At any time before abinding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.Columbia's ```bid/offer''' auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in FERC's Order 637.   *   Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will   begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and all available capacity will be   posted prior to 8:000 a.m. (EST).   *   The auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non-   discriminatory basis.   *   The auction is user-friendly since it will use Columbia's existing   EBB format. All information concerning rules and procedures will be   made available on the Internet.   *   The method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since   bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to   each capacity package made available.   *   As is Columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's   identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection   criteria were applied.   *   The bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all   bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to   all bidders through an Internet-based system.```We believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all partiesas well as innovative in design,''' Levander said.Levander said the proposal not only meets the Commission's principles, it is based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire fortransparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process.Columbia Gas Transmission, with offices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, Va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day tomarkets along a 12,5550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The company operates oneof the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of working capacity.Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Itsoperating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution,as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum product sales, and electric power generation.

        " Scott Neal/HOU/ECT on 111/20/2000 12:09 PM ---\"scott neal\" &lt;sneal12@mindspring.com&lt; on 111/18/2000 01:30:30 PMTo: &lt;sneal@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: wall st. journal articleCalifornia Power Plants Get JoltAs Natural-Gas Supplies Are   CutBy Rebecca SmithStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal   LOS ANGELES --- Southern California power plants, already stressed to their   limits last summer, got another jolt this week as a cold snap caused a sharp   curtailment of supplies of natural gas used to generate electricity. The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce   electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that   an increased reliance on gas for power generation across the U.S. is putting the   reliability of the nation's electricity supply at risk. That's because virtually all power plants now under construction in the U.S.   burn gas and only gas. The units affected this week in San Diego were able to   shift to oil only because they were older plants that originally were   constructed to burn oil. Generators have been reluctant to add a dual-fuel   flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more polluting than gas   and generally has been costlier. In California, where gas-supply problems first surfaced on Monday in San   Diego, there is pessimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seems to grow   new heads every day. The state weathered three-dozen electrical emergencies last   summer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Officials had hoped to solve the   problem by speeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, they're   finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into   a gas problem. One official, who has been warning of the danger of reliance on a single   fuel, said this week's disruption pointed out the necessity of developing a   comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas and   electricity affect each other. \"We don't just need new generating plants and   transmission lines, we may need pipelines, too,\" said Terry Winter, chief   executive officer of the California Independent System Operator, the   organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity supplies. \"You   can't look at these things in isolation.\" The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,   San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful   of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In   California, residential and small businesses have first crack at natural gas,   and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating   plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns   some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immediately switched to oil. But   it didn't like doing so; its plants create three times as much pollution when   they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-pollution emission credits that power   plants here need to operate. The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short   of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was off-line, including   many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair   after being run at capacity limits throughout the summer. What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeds San Diego isn't big enough to   begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and   not big power plants. The problems could persist, off and on, through the winter. That's because   gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, but   especially in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last   summer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billion cubic feet of   gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billion cubic feet, or 43% less. Prices   also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a million British thermal units   to around $8 this week. Nationally, storage levels are down about 8% from a year   ago. \"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,\" said   John Lavorato, chief operating officer of Enron North America, a unit of Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up   in the Northeast, based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two   weeks. High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In   California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was $2228   per megawatt hour. That's double the price a week ago and five times the price a   year earlier. \n"
