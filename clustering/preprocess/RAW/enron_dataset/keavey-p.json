Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.

What should the consistent market convention for determining the first tranaction be?   If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the premium swap as the \"first transaction\"   and the discount as the second.   This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.   Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.   I will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.   The product description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily be able to determine the correct direction to trade.   I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get back to you .Thanks Pete\n"

The ability of all customers to execute trades and receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes and growing customer participation.   One of the benefits of this system is to allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled through third party brokers.   Enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer spreads. This committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since rollout last Nov.29.TransparencyThe existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness of bids and offers.   We will trade on the price and volume on our bid and offer.   The growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on the sometimes unreliable broker served market.   Many of our customers and competitors now use EOL as an information source as well as a trading vehicle.   EOL is the only service that provides free real time information on as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.   We have no competition in this regard.   This aspect of EOL has been helpful to the smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.   Deal FlowAs the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading benefits.   We are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.   Enron's market share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.   \n"

(Tiverton apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)   I will be pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no later than end of this week.   They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities including us.   Here are some details FYI:Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gasPower qty = 250 MWPower strike = $45/MwhGas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an implied heat rate of about 76667 mmbtu/GWhGas strike is $5.90/mmmBtuGas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateralPower firmness:   unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than 95%Gas firmness:   secondary firmPlease get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any feedback on the degree of \"strategic fit\" this position would provide us.   Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit off).   Thanks allJohn\n"
