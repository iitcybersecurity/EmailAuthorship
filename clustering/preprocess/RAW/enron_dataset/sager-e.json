PG&amp;E revised the Total Volume to 981,6000 MWh.   Avista didnot respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.   Our records showthat the original volume of 982,4000 is correct (there was a leap-year day inyear 2000).   The broker confirm and the PG&amp;E revision seem to be both inerror.   Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy andEnron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.   Since thisAssignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommendslanguage to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email fromBlair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&amp;E andEnron? Please advise.(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a TotalVolume of 14,4000.   PG&amp;E accepted the confirm \"as is.\"   The brokerconfirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.   Therefore, bothPG&amp;E and AVISTA screwed up.   HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh'sshould correctly be as per the broker confirmation.   Again, our counselrecommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (seemail from Blair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable toPG&amp;E and Enron?   Please advise.To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enronand Avista.   Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron'sconfirm's prevail).   Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.   Wewould like to see those confirms in advance if possible.Lastly, time is of the essense.

The last panel of the day has acomparison of the EEI and the WSPP and what the future holds for each.

Also, please feel free to pass thebrochure on to any counterparties in the west that you think would benefit.FYI, if there is enough interest we can try to arrange getting additionalrooms at the Four Seasons at the conference rate.

This is the first I've seen of the term sheet, and I haven't even taken the time to read it, so I'm not even sure exactly what this deal is.   \"Tolling\" means so many different things...   Shari sent this company an EEI Master this summer and has been bugging them about it but w/ no response (according to the database).   Maybe this would be a good opportunity to advance that...And I'm still working on the Maine SOS proposal, and VPPSA and the N. Carolina project that David Fairley wants comments on yesterday, as well as the Reedy Creek stuff that came up as a rush yesterday afternoon (I've left you a vmail on that).

Preliminary feedback from the customer has been positive, so I am hopeful that we will come to mutually agreeable pricing and terms on this transaction.   I should get some additional feedback sometime today. I have raised the flag with the customer that we need to put paper and credit terms in place, and given their desire to close on this quickly, we will likely need to move quickly on this today/tomorrow.   As for cedit, their consultant indicated that a corp guarantee from the Black Hill Power Corp parent is probably not the customer's preferred approach, but rather credit arrangements tagged specifically to the project.   The project is owned by Black Hills Energy Capital, which invests in power projects through some sort of investment fund.   Their consultant speculated that Enron might have some interests in that investment fund relating to some projects out West, but he wasn't sure.   In any event, depending on their desire to move forward with us, we will need to be ready to talk credit/contract with them on short notice.I'll keep you all updated on any feedback i get from the customer.RegardsJohn\n"

The two companies entered into the agreement with FERC's Market Oversight and Enforcement Section to resolve all the issues in the show-cause order [IN0I-3-0001].Specifically, the agreement calls for Williams to refund $8 million of the $10.85 million in additional revenues it received when two AES generation units, designated as reliability must-run (RMR) units, failed to provide immediate service to the Cal-ISO in April and May. The ISO was forced to call upon other non-RMR units and pay a much higher price (near or at $750/MWh) to Williams. Williams is the exclusive marketer for power from the two AES plants at issue --- AES Alamitos LLC and AES Huntington Beach LLC in Southern California. The Commission also conditioned Williams' market-based authority such that it will have to bear the financial cost of replacement power if a RMR unit is unavailable at any time over the next year.Significantly, the agreement does not find that either Williams or AES abused their market power in California. It rejected the California Public Utilities Commission's request to impose penalties --- over and above refunds --- on the companies. Moreover, the agreement does not put an end to the \"formal, non-public investigation\" that FERC ordered in mid-March into violations arising out of the conduct of Williams and AES.   \n"

I recognize that you are still reviewing certain questions/points with CDWR and there may be some items reflected in this draft that neither you nor CDWR has \"signed off\" on.   Nonetheless, in certain cases I thought it made sense to provide you with specific contract language on some of the points we discussed so that you could clearly see what we may be proposing on a particular item.Please note, in particular, the following:---on the LD calculation, we reverted to your proposed language on obtaining multiple market quotes, etc.   However, after talking to Enron this evening, we would like to propose that if quotes cannot be obtained despite the parties' good faith efforts to do so, then only in that circumstance would the calculation be based on the Non-Defaulting Party's losses.   While, based on the product Enron is selling, we anticipate that quotes will be readily obtainable, we think it makes sense to revert to the Non-Defaulting Party's loss calculation in the highly unlikely event that quotes are not obtainable despite using all efforts to do so.   I know that you expressed some reservations the other evening that this process potentially could be subject to some manipulation.   This is not so.   If CDWR was the Defaulting Party and it disputes the loss calculation made by Enron, such dispute would become the subject of arbitration.   In such case, the Non-Defaulting Party's would have to furnish its historical and current power curves to prove its case.   Since those same figures necessarily are needed by Enron to report its trading positions on a day to day basis as part of its normal business operations and such information feeds directly into its financial reporting statements and other relevant financial information, etc. that becomes, in part, part of its SEC filings, in a discovery proceeding this information would be very transparent.---with respect to the situs of any arbitration proceeding, Enron strongly believes that it is only fair to both parties that this be conducted in a neutral site.   The draft provides for New York City, although Enron is open to other possible locations.---the revised draft reflects only the $127/MWh alternative scenario since you indicated that, preliminarily, you felt that CDWR would not be likely to choose the alternative structure we had discussed.---we would like to further discuss the effect of an adverse federal regulatory change.   I'm sure you can appreciate this in light of the current environment, although we would think that freely negotiated bilateral contracts would not be subject to the types of changes being discussed.   Enron is not seeking a termination right with LDs, but would like to further discuss a termination right without compensation in the event of a major adverse federal development affecting the contract.---we have dropped our request that Enron have the right to suspend performance in the case of a Bond downgrade event.   However, we think it is appropriate that if that circumstance occurs, that the due date for payments by CDWR should shorten to 7 days and if the Bonds are subsequently upgraded that the payment schedule would revert accordingly.---you requested that we propose a limit on the right of a Non-Defaulting Party to suspend its performance in the case of a Default by the Defaulting Party.   We included a 60-NERC day limit on such right in the revised draft.   This is important to Enron as we discussed, particularly in light of Enron's acceptance of the 180 day period on the timing of a Termination Payment which, as you know, is unheard of in the power sale (or virtually any other) arena.   (Nonetheless, we fully understand the position enunciated by the bond people on this point).---on assignment, the Enron commercial people cannot agree to a pre-approved right of CDWR to assign the contract to the IOUs.   As we discussed, it may very well be the case that at the time any assignment were to be effected that Enron may already be at the limit of its overall exposure with those counter parties.   It can't be in a position where such an assignment could cause it to violate those limits.---we included an outside date by which Enron must decide whether or not to go forward of the first to occur of (1) September 30, 20001 or (2) seven days after the Bonds are issued.   You had indicated that CDWR might be willing to consider such an \"outside date\" as long as (i) the $127/MWh pricing was in effect from April 1 and (2) Enron had to act very shortly after the Bonds are issued.   We have proposed 7 days for this.---in concept, we probably will be ok with the alternative of securing a credit rating for the Fund (as opposed to the Bonds), although we have referred that question to the credit people to make sure.---in light of your response about opinions not being provided by outside counsel, we modified the confirmation to request that the opinions could be from the AG, or if CDWR cannot do that, then from the GC of CDWR.   We felt that this would not involve additional work since these presumably will be rendered in connection with the Bonds and we provided that they generally would be provided to us after the Bonds are issued.I think the foregoing represent most of the items we had discussed.   Please let me know when you wish to discuss.   Also, it may make sense for our next call to have the respective Enron and CDWR commercial folks on the call since it may be the case that many of the final decisions involved may be commercial ones.Lastly, please note that while we have discussed most of the points addressed in the revised drafts with Enron, in order to expedite the process, we are sending these drafts simultaneously to you and Enron.   Thus, it is possible that Enron may have further modifications or changes to the documents.Thanks.   We look forward to working with you to finalize the requisite documents.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

Members of the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Subcommittee opened? hearings today on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Southern California Edison Company (SCE), Edison International (EIX), and the California Department of Water and Power (CDWR).? Testifying on behalf of SCE were SCE Vice President Bob Foster and Ann Cohen.? Additional hearings will be scheduled next week at which time the subcommittee will hear from representatives of the Governor, the Attorney General, and CDWR.? Among other things, committee members questioned the wisdom of acquiring the transmission system, particularly on an \"as is\" basis, the price to be paid, alternative structures that would not require an acquisition by the state, and the rate of return on new investment in the utility. 2.? Also in Sacramento, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market is scheduled to continue its investigation Thursday on market manipulation.? 3.? Governor Davis' representatives have been negotiating a transaction with Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission assets.? The Governor's representatives expect to have an agreement within one to two weeks. 4.? Also today, Governor Davis announced the appointment of Richard Sklar to head a team that will speed the construction of power plants in the state.? The \"Governor's Generation Implementation Taskforce\" will work to bring electrical generation facilities on line by coordinating state permitting, siting, finance, design, and construction efforts in a \"one stop shop.\" 5.? At its open meeting this evening, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved an order addressing market monitoring and mitigation for California wholesale power markets.? Based on the FERC staff presentation and discussion during the meeting, it appears that the market monitoring and mitigation plan for California includes the following:(1)? a requirement that all generators which entered into a Participating Generator Agreement with the ISO, and all non-public utilities in California that sell into the ISO's real-time market or use the ISO transmission grid, must offer all available electric capacity during all hours to the ISO real-time market, except for hydroelectric units.(2)? all public utility load serving entities in California must submit demand bids in real-time markets during all hours.(3)? all sales by market participants that have been granted authority by the FERC to sell power at market-based rates are subject to a refund condition to prevent anti-competitive bids into real time markets.(4)??? the ISO is required to submit weekly reports to the FERC on scheduled outages and bid data to facilitate market monitoring.(5)??? all sales into the ISO real-time market during a period of reserve deficiency (i.e., during Stage 1, 2 or 3 emergencies) will be subject to price mitigation.? The FERC order will include a formula that the ISO will be required to apply for purposes of calculating a proxy price for all such sales.The order will also enhance the ISO's ability to coordinate and control planned outages. The mitigation plan will be in effect for a one-year period, and will be subject to periodic review.? The FERC is also requiring the ISO and the investor-owned utilities to submit a filing by June 1, 20001, to form a Regional Transmission Organization (RTO).? If an RTO filing is not submitted by that date, then the market monitoring and mitigation plan will terminate automatically.? The FERC is also directing the parties to work with RTO West (an RTO approved for the Pacific Northwest) to develop a plan for including California within RTO West, with a goal of ultimately creating one RTO for the entire western interconnection.? Finally, the FERC is instituting an investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power sales throughout the western interconnection.? Apparently, potential refund liability would apply to wholesale power sale transactions in the western interconnection entered into for a period of 24 hours or less and made when reserve deficiencies are 7.5% or less.FERC also approved the formation of RTO West, an eight-state RTO combining the transmission assets of nine utilities in the Pacific Northwest.? The FERC asked the RTO to make a submission to it by December 1 of this year on its plans for including Canadian transmission and widening the scope of its operations in a broader regional system. RTO West first submitted its plans to the FERC last October. It includes nine electric utilities serving eight western states with some 50,000 miles of transmission lines. The nine utilities include Avista, BPA, Idaho Power, Montana Power, Nevada Power, PacifiCorp, Portland General Electric, Puget Sound Energy and Sierra Pacific. The states where the RTO West would operate are Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada, Utah and parts of Montana, Wyoming and California.

(NYSE:CPN &lt;http:///finance.yahoo.com/q?s=cpn&amp;amp;d=t&lt; - news &lt;/n/c/cpn.html&lt;) said on Monday that bankrupt utility Pacific Gas and Electric was in breach of contract after failing to make some $267 million in payments and it would seek prompt court action to secure payment or be freed from its energy contracts.ADVERTISEMENT   &lt;http:///rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=78111756:LREC/A=631358/R=0/*http:///www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html &lt; &lt;http:///rd.yahoo.com/M=183981.1387645.2975805.1320407/D=fin/S=78111756:LREC/A=631358/R=0/*http:///www.hrblock.com/taxes/partners/yahoo/index.html &lt;```Right now there is breach of contract''' for power Calpine has provided Pacific Gas and Electric, Calpine senior vice president Lisa Bodensteiner told an analysts teleconference. ```We are filing motions this week with the bankruptcy court to direct PG&amp;E to pay us. If it doesn't decide this, we will then ask the court to relieve of us of our contacts and let us sell to the open market,''' she said. San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine said in a statement earlier Monday it was confident PG&amp;E would be able to pay Calpine's 111 qualifying facility subsidiaries (QFs) for past-due power sales. Calpine's 111 QF plants, which generate around 6000 megawatts of power from small natural gas-fired and geothermal plants, are part of a fleet of qualifying facilities that can produce up to about a third of all the power generated in California. As of March 31, Pacific Gas and Electric owed a total of $643 million for power the QFs have supplied to its customers, according to the California Public Utilities. PG&amp;E must assume Calpine's contracts in its bankruptcy proceedings for them to continue, Calpine said. PG&amp;E Corp. (NYSE:PCG &lt;http:///finance.yahoo.com/q?s=pcg&amp;amp;d=t&lt; - news &lt;/n/p/pcg.html&lt;) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co., California's largest inverstor-owned utility, filed for Chapter 111 bankruptcy protection on Friday after piling up around $9 billion in wholesale power costs it has not been able to recover due to California's 19996 deregulation legislation. Calpine senior vice president Jim Macias told analysts that if PG&amp;E ```were dumb enough''' not to affirm the contracts, Calpine could make an extra $380 million selling the energy tied up in its QF contracts with PG&amp;E on the open spot market. ```We are in constant discussions with state municipal utilities and the state to sell our power. We are very confident we will be able to move this energy should the contacts be rejected,''' Macias said. He estimated spot electricity prices in the state are currently about $260 per megawatt hour. A Calpine spokeswoman said Monday the company's QF facilities operated when California declared power emergencies, but could not comment on whether they operate when an alert is not called. In addition to the $267 million currently owed, San Francisco-based Calpine also holds a long-term $68 million note receivable with PG&amp;E for energy deliveries from 20003 to 2014, but that the note is note yet due. Calpine, which said it did not expect the $267 million PG&amp;E owes it to grow, said the utility had paid 15 percent of what PG&amp;E owes it for energy delivered in December and January, but had not paid anything since. Calpine, which has its own natural gas storage reserves in Sacramento, Calif., also said it expected to make payments to its gas suppliers. \n"

Subject to and without waiving this objection, EPMI states that CPSC made no apparent effort to seek LCRA's consent to an assignment as contemplated by the July 30, 1999.   In telephone conversations in the late afternoon of the last day for the parties to have entered into such an assignment pursuant to the terms of the July 30, 1999 letter agreement (which conversations were initiated by EPMI several days earlier) CPSC indicated that it would begin to negotiate an assignment without a parent guarantee, but CPSC did not, in fact, agree to an assignment before the expiration of the time period contemplated by the July 30, 1999 letter agreement.   After that time had expired, CPSC did not continue negotiations with EPMI.Let me know what you think.Bonnie J.

This form has been created using the EEI form of master used by Enron North America, the Canadian gas master and the British Energy Power Purchase Agreement.   Wherever possible and particularly with respect to many of the procedural provisions, such as billing, confirming, triggering events and the miscellaneous provisions, I have used the language from the current form of Canadian gas master both to create consistency between our Canadian gas and power businesses for our operations, systems and accounting groups and to hopefully make it easier for our commercial people to market the power paper to counterparties, as it will be very similar in many respects to our form of gas master with which many counterparties will already be familiar.Regarding the power products tradeable under this master, further to a discussion Peter and I had with Jeff Hodge and Christian Yoder, the products described in Schedule A have been created based upon an amalgam of the EEI products and the WSPP schedules of products.   Given the uncertainty of how exactly the two Canadian markets that are set to open in 20001 will look, it was determined best to have a minimum of broadly defined products, which will be further defined over time as the markets develop, rather than trying to introduce a large number of complex products that may end up neither applicable nor appropriate and which would only serve to make negotiations of the form with counterpartys more difficult.I would ask each of you to review the form and provide me with any final comments you may have at your earliest convenience so that Enron Canada can commence marketing the paper to counterparties.   In performing your review, please keep in mind that this master is intended to be an agreement that is cross-jurisdictional and, therefor, general in scope and nature and will be equally applicable to power trades in Alberta as in Ontario (or any other province over time).   Any jurisdictional specific provisions will be built into the confirms on a trade by trade basis.   Nevertheless, particularly for Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson, I do want to ensure that we have not included any provisions that may cause Enron Canada any concerns in Ontario or Alberta based upon our current understanding of how those two regulatory regimes will unfold.Thanks for your assistance on this matter and I look forward to any comments you may have on the document.Greg\n"

I believe that we have now settled on the form of the agreement, but there remain a few commercial issues which we will be resolving in the next week or so.   If anyone has any final comments on the form, please communicate them to me as soon as possible.   I would also like to have any input from Rob Hemstock and Aleck Dadson on any particular issues relating to market operations in Ontario or Alberta.   I also need someone in the Toronto office to provide me with the definition of \"Interval Meters\" that I have included as a potential delivery point.   I have left that definition as a bullet and we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense.   Finally, once the last few business issues are resolved next week, I would like to set up a call with Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager to obtain final internal legal approval on this agreement so that our commercial people can commence marketing the paper to potential counterparties.   Mark Powell will be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place.ThanksGreg\n"

We would like to invite you to participate in the conference as speakers because of your roles in developing the Master Agreement.   I've attached a proposed program for the conference would appreciate your comments.   Not all the issues need to be part of the oral presentation, but could be included in the written handouts.Please review the program to see which issues you might want to address.   Let me know if you are interested in being on the program, are available, or have someone else to recommend as a speaker.   As co-chairs of the working group, it seems logical to make Patti and Dave moderators. for the main sessions on the contract.   I've filled in some other potential speakers.   Also, we were thinking of having speakers on managing trading floor operations and credit ratings for power marketers.   Any suggestions there would be welcome.   If need be, we can set up a conference call to discuss working out the rest of the presenters for the program.***Andrew S.

All of you should have received a black binder labelled \"Analysis of ECT's Finacial, Power, Gas Forms\"   which contains all of the long and short forms used for trading (as such forms existed in January 1999), as well as my summary comparison as to how each of the forms handles certain legal issues (eg, termination, cover, assignement, confidentiality ...).   If you did not receive or cannot locate this binder, let me know and I will forward to you another copy.   This analysis was done in January.   I am aware that some of the forms may have changed since then but have not undertaken to \"update\" the memo as we will be able to discuss such changes at the meeting.The purpose of the meeting is to review how each of the Houston-based trading   forms has been structured and to note where there are differences.   The ultimate goal is to determine what Enron's \"model\" trading provisions should be and to determine a consistent approach unless there is a justified rational for treating the commodities in a different manner.   With this in mind, I would hope to be able to create a \"modular type\" contract   whereby each legal issue would have a recommended approach, evidenced by language that will be approved by the group.   By way of example, Enron's gas contract prohibits assignement without consent, which consent can be withheld for any reason.   The financial form provides that a party can not unreasonably withhold its consent.   At this meeting we would discuss what the preferred approach is and then begin the process of drafting appropriate language, which language would be approved at a seperate meeting.   This   \"modular assignment section\" could then be dropped into all trading forms unless differences were required due to the commodity/product involved.You will note that the analysis performed to date does not include all areas of a trading contract.   Similiar steps will still need to be undertaken with other provisions such as credit terms.   At the meeting, I hope to further discuss the additional areas everybody believes should be reviewed.Aron Roffwarg, a lawyer   from Bracewell, will also be at the meeting to assist us in this effort.Thanks \n"

However, the valuation of the parties' exposure will be defined as exposures under the existing physical power Master agreement as well as the new financial ISDA Master.   [both the physical confirmation and the ISDA Master will need to reference this stair-step Threshold provision that will govern margin calls under both transactions]deletion of the investment grade MAC for both credit worksheets (replaced by stair-step Threshold discussed above)third party cross-default amounts:   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. is $1000MM and Enron Corp. is $50MM (contingent upon approval by Andy Fastow or Jeff McMahon.

Hiss.   I agree w/ Patty and Liz that product definition should be the primary focus of the meeting.   It would seem most of the transmission related issues PECO (or Dynegy) have could be addressed in the context of the force majeure definition and how specific product definitions tighten or loosen FM excuses for non-performance.I think we can represent that discussions w/ FERC staff will take place during January.   Our meeting coordinator is talking w/ Mariott about roll out meetings in Houston during the first week of March and in NYC late April/early May.   Let me know if you have any scheduling conflicts during those timeframes and I'll circulate some proposed dates w/ the product definitions.   Also, let me know if you are not interested in participating in one of or both roll-outs.I will gladly circulate product definitions, but will be out of town after the 10th.   Could you CC: Patricia Young at EEI 202/508-5757 pyoung@eei.org with any definitions you want circulated.Another topic I would suggest discussing briefly   if time is available is the results of the contract survey.   We have received many responses. Tabulation of the results should be done by our meeting.Andrew S.

One area that I believeneeds more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; I thinkthis is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they are concernedabout.I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to the agenda.Do we have a definition of the \"Into ___\" product that has been updated since theNovember 9 conference call?   Is there a new defintion of the \"Firm (LD-SystemReliability)\" product?What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?   Is there anyconceivable way we will have the time?Thanks,Harlan(See attached file: EEI-NEMA AGENDA.DOC)\n"

A power struggle has begun, despite the fact that most&lt; traders, preschedulers and trading managers aren't even aware of the&lt;   new contract.&lt;&lt;   Southern Co. (SO) Vice President Bobby Campo has been a leader in WSPP&lt; since the organization's inception and has been chairman of its&lt;   contract committee for four years. Yet Southern Co. Energy Marketing's&lt; chief counsel, Sonnet Edmonds, is a leader in the rival-contract&lt;   faction.&lt;&lt;   Will EEI, along with its comrade, the National Energy Marketers&lt; Association, manage to dethrone the WSPP contract or crash? WSPP's&lt;   raison d'etre is to manage and promote use of its contract, which is&lt; traded&lt; extensively in the West and has gained proponents in the East.&lt;&lt;   \"I'm not real excited about it right now,\" Campo said of the new&lt; contract.&lt; \"The EEI contract is being done by contract people and lawyers.&lt;   We - operators and power marketers - worked on our contract for years&lt; before we brought in the lawyers. It (the new contract) may die from a&lt;   lack of interest from participants, but EEI has the ability to keep it&lt; alive.\"&lt;&lt;   It isn't clear if the big power marketing companies will get the ball&lt; rolling by asking counterparties to switch to the EEI contract. Edmonds&lt;   hopes that Southern Co. will do so.&lt;&lt;   \"Management hasn't given the official word yet, but we participated in&lt; its&lt; development, so I imagine we'll use it at some point,\" she said.&lt;&lt;   Enron Corp.'s (ENE) general counsel also worked on the EEI contract, but&lt; the company hasn't made a decision to actually use it.&lt;&lt;   Entergy Corp.'s (ETR) general counsel, Christopher Bernard, led the&lt; effort&lt; to develop the new contract as head of NEM's standardized&lt;   contract committee. But Entergy's Jim Kenney is chairman of WSPP's&lt; executive committee. Entergy's power trading managers, meanwhile,&lt;   haven't even read the new contract yet.&lt;&lt;   Duke Power Co. (DUK), an NEM member, is looking at it, a spokesman said.&lt; Enron and Southern Co. aren't NEM members, though they&lt;   serve on its contract committee.&lt;&lt;   Several sources said American Electric Power (AEP) has agreed to be the&lt; guinea pig, and plans to switch to the EEI contract with&lt;   counterparties on eastern U.S. trades. A spokesman for the utility&lt; couldn't&lt; confirm or deny that rumor because Paul Addis, president of AEP&lt;   Energy Services, has imposed a vow of silence on AEP's traders.&lt;&lt;   There are elements of the EEI contract that power marketers may like. One&lt; innovation is a new product called \"Firm (No Force Majeure),\"&lt;   which requires the payment of liquidated damages for failure to deliver -&lt; no excuses, no force majeure, just send a check.&lt;&lt;   The new contract also has two other firm products. \"Firm (Liquidated&lt; Damages)\" is closest to the WSPP firm product, but it defines force&lt;   majeure more strictly than WSPP. \"Firm (LD-System Reliability)\"&lt; explicitly&lt; allows a selling utility to curtail deliveries without paying liquidated&lt;   damages if necessary to maintain native load. Of particular interest to&lt; traders of eastern U.S. electricity is the fact that the EEI contract&lt;   defines what an \"into\" product is.&lt;&lt;   WSPP has debated the introduction of such products, but in the end has&lt; tried to come up with a single, agreed-upon product for trading.&lt;&lt;   \"EEI has created a lot of different types of firm products, but that can&lt; create problems. Many people have said 'no, we want one firm&lt;   product',\" said WSPP's counsel, Michael Small, of Washington, D.C., law&lt; firm Wright and Talisman.&lt;&lt;   So why didn't the EEI group just work with WSPP to get changes made to&lt; the&lt; existing standard? Too much bureaucracy, according to&lt;   Southern's Edmonds.&lt;&lt;   \"Changes to the WSPP contract require approval from 90% of the members,&lt; after working through the operations committee and the&lt;   executive committee. Then the changes have to be filed at Federal Energy&lt; Regulatory Commission,\" Edmonds said.&lt;&lt;   Coincidentally, WSPP's executive committee is meeting Friday in San Diego&lt; to discuss what changes are needed in the definition of its firm&lt;   product. Western utilities are pushing hard for \"firm\" to mean backed up&lt; by&lt; reserves of generating assets or previously purchased power. In&lt;   other words, some utilities want to eliminate short positions from power&lt; markets.&lt;&lt;   At least one power marketing company, which didn't want to be named, will&lt; switch to the EEI contract if that change gets made to WSPP.&lt;&lt;   For the EEI contract to fly, not only will the lawyers at the big trading&lt; companies need to make it their companies' standard, but traders will&lt;   have to convince utilities to abandon most, if not all, force majeure&lt; claims. Many municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives are&lt;   forbidden to do so by state regulations.&lt;&lt;   For traders, though, the biggest adjustment to make if the EEI contract&lt; does take off will be more social than professional. The semi-annual&lt;   meeting of the WSPP's operations committee is as much fun as any blatant&lt; boondoggle should be. The serious work of a handful of&lt;   committee members is a small hook on which hangs the revelry of hundreds&lt; of&lt; power marketers, brokers and utility staffers. As it stands,&lt;   non-committee members must have a hard time convincing bosses that their&lt; presence is necessary at the meeting.&lt;&lt;   How on earth will traders justify going if the WSPP contract is no longer&lt; used? Can EEI throw a good party? And how will the Gucci-loafered&lt;   EEI executives from Washington handle $1,000 dares to go naked in a bar?&lt;&lt;   Such are the questions now vexing America's electric utilities.&lt;&lt;   -By Mark Golden; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604;&lt; mark.golden@dowjones.com&lt;&lt;   Copyright &amp;copy; 1999, Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc\n"

I tried to include a blackline, but it seemed to get corrupted so I don't know if it will be of much use to you. A few notes:(1)   I did not have the various contracts with me when I reviewed this, but I have asked Jim if he could make sure I did not make any inaccurate statements as well as input the few contract section references that are open and the information on the Canadian termination.   (However, I was not sure whether you wanted Peter Keohane to input the relevant information on the Canadian side.).(2)   In light of PG&amp;E's letter to us, I thought we may want to make some short statements about the affiliate set off rights under the Bankruptcy Code in the termination letter.(3)   I modified some of the language on the CalPX liabilities.   I didn't have my exposure sheet with me, but I thought I recall that we were both owed money from the CalPX   and that we had some risk on the chargeback liability depending on how FERC ultimately comes out on the issue.   As you know, the FERC decision about 3 weeks ago prohibited the CalPX from proceeding with the chargeback \"under these circumstances\" or some type of language like this, but it seemed to have punted the final resolution of the issue until at least the commandeered contract valuation issue had been resolved---thus, although perhaps not likely, it seemed to me at the time that FERC gave itself an opening to reconsider the chargeback issue after the valuation determination had been made.(4)   While I bracketed the language, I thought we may want to affirmatively and briefly set forth the business reason why EPMI is holding the direct access claim to at least give them something to think about.   As we have discussed, PG&amp;E's likely reaction will be that we are using unsupportable self help to not pay them anything on the termination of the 3 power confirmations by claiming a set off for the negative CTCs.   To the extent we can articulate a short business rationale for EPMI having that claim, it may at least make them pause as to whether our business rationale arguably could prevail.(5)   We note in the letter certain claims we have against PG&amp;E that we are not setting off---e.g., the ISDA termination payment.   We also reference the claims held by EPMI through the CalPX, even though we are not \"terminating\" any \"contracts\" in that respect.   I assume that we do not want to reference in the letter the claims held by Portland General which \"route\" through the CalPX and the ISO, even though we are not claiming rights of offset for those.   PG&amp;E will be put on notice of those when we put in Portland's claims as part of our proof of claim with the bankruptcy court. I'll plan on getting together with you to review this tomorrow afternoon.   Lastly, I have not read the decision yet, but I saw that the DC Circuit upheld FERC in all respects in the PCA case so since our contracts do not have to be on file, they can be terminated without waiting for the 60 day period to expire.   That should reduce another potential challenge to the power contract termination.Thanks.JohnJohn KlaubergLeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene &amp; MacRae, L.L.P.212 424-8125jklauber@llgm.com===This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

        " Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 12/28/999 07:10 AM ---Stuart Zisman12/27/999 10:555 PMTo: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rodney Malcolm/HOU/ECT@ECT, archie.malcolm@sympatico.cacc: David Portz/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Draft of Confirmation for Physical Transaction with Merrill (Moosehead)As we discussed, attached is my draft of a confirmation under the Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.   In addition to the comments/questions noted within the Confirmation itself, I have the following thoughts/questions:1) Note that the Enron Corp Guaranty is currently limited to an aggregate amount of $30,000,000 (this may become an issue late in the day when the folks over at Merrill figure out that this is one of the disadvantages to using a confirm as opposed to doing a sep. transaction with a separate and distinct Enron Corp. Guaranty);2) Per Section 1.1 of the Master, in the event of any conflicts between the Master and a Confirm for a particular transaction, the Confirm governs;3) Section 1.4 of the Master Agreement makes reference to a \"Qualified Financial Contract\" - is that applicable to this Transaction?   Might this somehow cause the accountants to treat the Transaction differently?;4) Do we need to negate the reference to a \"Forward Contract\" in Section 4.6 of the Master (Elizabeth we spoke about a concern that you had regarding this exact issue);5) What changes should be made to the Confirm given the agreed to changes in the ISDA (Severability and Notice Update for example);6) The last sentence of the Master appears to be missing some language.   It currently reads \"Disallowance of cost pass-through or any unfavorable or any Affiliate of the Non-Defaulting Party shall not constitute a requirement for a change to the terms of this Agreement.\";7) Should we still eliminate the last portion of Section 8.1(ii) of the Master to permit free assignment to an Affiliate (this previously was a big issue given our concern that we might have to assign certain rights to an Affiliate in the event of a bankruptcy).   Section 8.1(ii) currently reads:   Neither Party shall assign this Agreement or its rights hereunder without the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent may be withheld   in its sole discretion; provided, however, either Party may, without the consent of (but with notice to) the other Party (and without relieving itself from   liability hereunder), (i) transfer, sell, pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement and all Transactions hereunder as a whole or the accounts,   revenues or proceeds hereof as a whole in connection with any financing or other financial arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this   Agreement to an Affiliate of such Party; provided, that such Party's Credit Support Provider issues a Credit Support   Document substantially in the form provided in connection with the execution hereof,; 8) The draft of the Confirmation does not make reference to any of the 3 \"Facilities\".   Does it have to for acct purposes even though the only time that it was used was in the sections deal with gas supply (which did not make it into the Confirmation) and Section 6.2 of the prior physical agreement which used to make \"Buyer responsible for charges imposed on the delivery of Energy from a given Facility but related to the operation of third party transmission\" (this provision is not reflected in the Master and I suspect that Merrill would object strongly to its incorporation);9) Did we ever determine whether the draft of the Confidentiality Agreement that I prepared was executed by Merrill?; and10) The Master currently defines Stranded Costs but does not contain the standard provision regarding the same (should this be introduced???) \n"

Those in favor of adding such language hope to avoid the \"long form confirmations\" which have proliferated in the marketplace in the absence of an underlying master agreement - those containing arbitration clauses, Y2K representations and other non-commercial terms.   Those who oppose adding such language believe it is critical to market participants to know at some point, relatively promptly after the oral trade call, that the confirm represents the commercial Transaction, and that trade tapes can be overwritten.   They ask only that counterparties accept or reject the commercial Transaction terms within two Business Days.   If there is a dispute about the terms of the Transaction as it appears in the Confirmation, they want to be notified so that tapes can be preserved and the issues can be addressed promptly.After much discussion, the Drafting Committee has developed language that could be added.   Given the strong feelings on both sides of this issue, however, the Drafting Committee decided to poll each company in the Working Group as to whether such   additional language should be added at all.   If the Working Group votes \"yes\", the additional language below would be inserted in Article 2.3 as an option that only would apply if selected on the cover sheet.The following wording was developed by the Drafting Committee:\"If a Confirmation contains provisions, other than those provisions relating to the commercial terms of the Transaction (e.g., price, special transmission conditions), which modify or supplement the general terms and conditions of this Master Agreement (e.g., arbitration provisions,   additional representations and warranties), then such provisions shall not be deemed to be accepted pursuant to this Article 2.3 unless agreed to either orally or in writing by the Parties; provided that the foregoing will not affect the validity and binding nature of the Transaction.\"Accordingly, would ONE representative from each company in the Working Group please respond using the REPLY function of your email program to the following questions by cob Tuesday, February 29: 1. Should the language addressing this point be inserted into the Master Agreement?   (If   yes, the language will be an option selected on the Cover Sheet.)Yes___ No___Andrew S.

Cutting through the \"edge\" of her comments, no doubt brought on by the frustration of being outvoted, I believe she has some valid points on our process here.   I have avoided   taking a position on substantive questions regarding the contract, but I too have a process concern   which I have raised with some of you individually.   I apologize for not vocalizing these concerns this morning.   Nevertheless, this is what I intend to do .   Given that Mitch was not available for the discussion and knowing Mitch's position on this issue compels me to release the comments he wanted circulated before going on vacation.   If there is a consensus from the balloting that the language should be included, but not as an option or as an \"opt out\" provision, this drafting committee should respect that sentiment.The attention of many members of the Drafting Committee has waned andEEI members (electric utilities which conduct wholesale powertransactions) are no longer represented on the Drafting Committee.Mitch, in his email, did not think EEI member views were considered onthe Tuesday call.   And today's call   by Constellation, Enron, EPMC (andJones, Day and Schiff) did not even include any EEI members...   The language compromise I accept, and believe that Mitch wouldaccept, in the spirit of Drafting Committee give and take.   But let'snot kid ourselves.   Today, a few members of the Drafting Committee madea decision that even Mitch (the only EEI member on the Tuesday call) didnot think we had made or would make.   Read his email.   Today's decisionwas to not even \"allow\" the EEI members' vote to be heard   to choosewhat they overwhelmingly chose in Houston --- that is, to have theprovision in Section 2.3 of the Contract --- not just an option on theCover sheet). Today's decision is just wrong.   As the person who was standing in the front of the room inHouston, I feel strongly   that I know what occurred, and what Comed,Dynegy,   Cinergy, IPALCO, AEP, Ameren and Toni Frost's group ofutilities, among others, know they voted on.   I am the person thatfolks are going to call to ask why their views were ignored.   I hadbecome comfortable with the explanation for the revote --- to either notadd the language at all, add to 2.3, or add as an option.   But nowWorking Group is not being given the choice   to vote as they did, likethe result or not, in Houston.   Even Fritz's suggestion that threechoices be given on the ballot was ignored.   Those three choices, as Iunderstood it, would have included an even more aggressive eliminationof the 2 business day presumption that the confirm, as sent, controls.   The question I asked...   why we are afraid of even giving theWorking Group the choice to express the same views they expressed inHouston...was never answered.   When   EEI members call me to ask about this, I intend to suggestthat they vote \"YES\" on the ballot, and then   add an admonition to theirballot that the language be included in 2.3 and not just be an option onthe cover sheet.   I would hope that the Drafting Committee (or whoeverremains on it) would at least consider such added comments although,again, after today I have my doubts.   I intend to call some of the EEImembers that I know will feel strongly about this.   Since I know Mitchwill not be around (and don't feel he should be disenfranchised), I alsointend to call AEP as a courtesy.   I no longer support the idea of notforwarding Mitch's email to the whole group, as he obviously intended.   Ironically or perhaps intentionally, the Drafting Committee'sfailure to address this directly until almost a month after the Houstonmeeting means people won't even have a 2 Business Day voting window.Nonetheless, regardless of the vote, I intend to discuss this in theimplementation discussion in the Houston/New York seminars.Andrew S.

Every effort has been made to be as inclusive in the process of creating this document as possible.   Many compromises were made in creating this contract and   is not necessarily everyone's ideal agreement.   Nevertheless, the contract should be a workable tool that hopefully will benefit the power market.   A clean and redline version of the contract are attached.   They were prepared by the Drafting Committee and every effort was made to include comments received during and since the September 24 meeting at EEI.At this stage of the initiative, it would not be productive to circulate non-substantive comments (word smithing/formatting).   On the other hand, it would be useful to send any substantive comments or questions about the mechanics of the contract and how the contract language might apply under certain scenarios.   The best forum to respond to your questions or comments will be the November 17 Power Marketing Transactions conference in Washington, D.C.   Accordingly, it would be helpful to tailor your comments to the conference program.   Questions, comments, and hypotheticals could be worked into the panel discussions.   Moreover, many of your colleagues from the Working Group will be on the panels or attending the conference.   For your convenience, a copy of the conference program is attached.

The general consensus of the drafting committee is that the Master Agreement is sound and there is no need for revision to the base terms and conditions of version 2.1.   Based on that meeting, the drafting committee would like to cover the following at the October 13 meeting :GETTING CONTRACT IN PLACE.   The drafting committee believes that the number one priority is to get the Master Agreement used by more participants in the marketplace.   We would like to hear from the working group about the status of the Master Agreement in their organizations and issues about the contract that are holding up its use.   We will solicit suggestions on how to get wider acceptance of the Master Agreement.   The drafting committee has thought of holding another workshop in late January to address implementation issues such as establsihing credit thresholds.STANDARDIZED SUPPLEMENTAL PROVISIONS.   There are   several areas not addressed in the base contract that are frequently used as customized supplemental provisions identified on many parties' cover sheets.   The drafting committee identified the following as useful to develop as suggested optional supplemental provisions that could be used in negotiating a cover sheet with a counterparty:   (1)   the incorporation of prior transactions as being governed by the Master Agreement; (2) the use of the Master Agreement for electronic trading; (3) alternative dispute resolution mechanisms; (4) treatment of new taxes or changes in regulatory policy; (5) additional products (e.g. Western firm or CAISO energy); (6) agreements with respect to agency relationships; (7) \"regulatory out\" provisions; and (8) provisions involving \"one-way\" counterparty relationships, i.e. sales only or purchases only.The drafting committee will ask the working group to allow it to develop these provisions and once consensus on language is reached among the drafting committee members, they would be made available for downloading on the EEI website for use by the industry as suggested optional provisions.   We will also discuss the ways to tie these provisions to the Master Agreement general terms.PROCEDURE FOR GETTING CONTRACT INTERPRETATION.   The drafting committee will discuss ways to get answers about the contract disseminated quickly.   One suggestion is to have a frequently asked questions section up on the EEI website.As a reminder, the meeting will be held from 10-4.   Please contact me if you have any questions or comments about the agenda.   If you plan to attend or need information about hotels or transportation, please contact Patricia Young at 202-508-5757 or pyoung@eei.org. Thank-you.Andrew S.

The group is called GISB-Canada and as the name suggests,they intend to use the GISB gas contract as the Base Agreement and tomodify the language to make it applicable in Canada.   At first, they werejust going to change language like \"MMBtu\" to \"joule\"; \"jurisdiction\" to\"province\"; and reference a Canadian Bank interest rate rather than theWall Street Journal.   They were going to stay away from what they deemed\"substantive\" changes.I have asked them to reconsider this decision and to take the opportunityto \"update\" the GISB, hopefully, in a manner that could be usedcross-border.   I have explained that most of our counterparties supplementthe GISB with their own Special Provisions and we could use thesesupplements as a starting point for creating an Industry Standard GISB\"update\" that could be used cross-border.In this regard, would you please send me a copy of your company's SpecialProvisions so that I can forward them to Ian Anderson in Canada.   Also,would you please put me in touch with someone in your organization thatmight be interested in participating in this effort.   I think it would bevery helpful for the Canadians to hear about our experience with GISB andgas trading in general in developing an Industry Standard Contract.   Thenext meeting in Canada is this Wednesday at 12:000 p.m. (Houston Time) andagain on June 26.   I would like to send them something to consider prior tothe June 26 meeting.Thank you so much for your help on this.Dede Russo\n"

The issue is to what extent Japanwill/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems tobe setting the pace, at least for the moment.* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japanwill in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.   We have attempted tocover this in EPSA.* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by theback-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific factsituations arise.* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place toimmediately address any failures.I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to distributeit to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.Best regardsPaul Davis &lt;&lt;Energy Trading Paper.doc&lt;&lt;---This is an e-mail from Baker &amp; McKenzie - Tokyo Aoyama Law Office (QualifiedJoint Enterprise Offices).

The issue is to what extent Japanwill/should follow the same allocation, on which subject the Enron EPSA seems tobe setting the pace, at least for the moment.* We cannot discount the danger that some of the counterparties in Japanwill in fact become insolvent or choose not to perform.   We have attempted tocover this in EPSA.* The treatment of force majeure, particularly non-performance by theback-to-back supplier/customer, will need more attention as specific factsituations arise.* The need for a commercial/legal response system to be in place toimmediately address any failures.I hope you find the paper useful and, as discussed, I rely on you to distributeit to other persons within Enron who are likely to be interested.Best regardsPaul Davis &lt;&lt;Energy Trading Paper.doc&lt;&lt;---This is an e-mail from Baker &amp; McKenzie - Tokyo Aoyama Law Office (QualifiedJoint Enterprise Offices).

The guaranty for the PPA is blacklined against the Enron EPC Contract guaranty in favor of the banks which was granted in connection with our Cabazon Wind Power Project (the project most recently financed by EWC) and the GPSA guaranty is blacklined against the PPA guaranty.   As we discussed last week, since the Enron guaranties will need to be in a form that will acceptable to our project lenders and equity participants, we thought that we should start with a form that was used in our last financing and that was negotiated by Enron and the banks.   We plan to use the same basic form for the Enron guaranty that will be made in favor of EPMI with respect to the seller's obligations under the PPA.   We will forward the draft of that guaranty to you later today.   Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions concerning the attached guaranties.

They have moved exclusively to the WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them against inconsistent contractual language.   They are not bending on this requirement at this time.   As such, I think we need to proceed with signing this agreement unless there are any significant issues.   Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working on this).   Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.   Her # is 281-297-3582.Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent us from executing this contract?

PG&amp;E revised the Total Volume to 981,6000 MWh.   Avista didnot respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.   Our records showthat the original volume of 982,4000 is correct (there was a leap-year day inyear 2000).   The broker confirm and the PG&amp;E revision seem to be both inerror.   Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy andEnron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.   Since thisAssignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommendslanguage to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email fromBlair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&amp;E andEnron? Please advise.(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a TotalVolume of 14,4000.   PG&amp;E accepted the confirm \"as is.\"   The brokerconfirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.   Therefore, bothPG&amp;E and AVISTA screwed up.   HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh'sshould correctly be as per the broker confirmation.   Again, our counselrecommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (seemail from Blair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable toPG&amp;E and Enron?   Please advise.To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enronand Avista.   Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron'sconfirm's prevail).   Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.   Wewould like to see those confirms in advance if possible.Lastly, time is of the essense.   We are scheduling power already for Januarydeliveries...therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as toprevent any problems with scheduling, etc.   I suppose that we could delaythe start dates to February 1st, 20001 if necessary.   Perhaps not a bigissue.Thanks,Nolan SteinerPh: 509-495-81999---Original Message---From: R.

        " Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 06/01/999 03:19 PM ---From: Mark - ECT Legal Taylor on 06/01/999 12:24 PMTo: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: FYIWestern Power Market Stands 'Poised on the Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser ConsultingGroup's 1999 Bulk Power OutlookFAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ --- Power markets in the Western System Coordinating Council are ```poised on theprecipice''' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer and next, according to a new study of the regionalmarket by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ```The West stands at least a one in three chance ofexperiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during the summer of 19998,''' said Judah Rose, a SeniorVice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications:   Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying   on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak capacity requirements. Because demand growth is   outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more extreme over the next two years.   Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive year of above-average hydroelectric generation   --- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus --- will again mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in   1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 19990s resurface, the West will find itself at an even greater risk of   price spikes.   Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 2000, the result of both higher regional spot   natural gas prices and the increasing value of ```pure capacity''' --- the value of ensuring reliability for consumers. The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and highlights the following key results:   Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand growth is strong, creating a long-term regional   capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 20005, unless there is a serious economic downturn in the region.   Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices is for negative real growth through 2010, but   the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market institutions continue to evolve and new supply is   slowly added over the next few years.   Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue to rise (but still remain below many other   regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.   Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power generation is poised to more than double by 2010,   with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas   supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if any, real price appreciation through 2010. ```The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the other five regional volumes, offerscomprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power markets,''' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of theICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ```No other firm can match our analytic capabilities --- which are based on an understanding of thefundamentals driving electric power markets --- and the knowledge gained from working one- on-one with the market's keyplayers.'''About the ICF 1999 Bulk Power OutlookICF's analysis of the Western market is part of the 1999 Bulk Power Outlook, an authoritative assessment of North Americanregional bulk power markets through 2010. The study also provides the analytical basis for ICF's extensive and well-respectedconsulting services providing market assessment, asset valuation, and project due diligence evaluations for the North Americanelectric power and natural gas industries. The 1999 Bulk Power Outlook is available for six regional markets --- West,Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, South Central, and Canada --- well as a National Subscription, which includes the six regionalstudies and a North American summary volume.

To legal, this means we sell power to BPA no strings attached   and assume nothing about who they resell it too.Obviously a clean one month sale to BPA is attractive.   But can it be detached from the larger call spread transaction?   I don't know.   Given this quandry, Greg Wolfe has advised me to hold off temporarily on preparing the one off confirmation   until the BPA option is sorted out.   I am following this sensible guidance and if anybody has a thought to the contrary please give me a call:   503-464-7845.   ---cgy \n"

These factors expose them =to the vagaries of the volatile spot power market.Wholesale power recently cost more than $1,4000 per megawatt hour, a more =than 40-fold increase over the $35 per megawatt hour rate last year.California imposed the rate freeze as part of its deregulation of the =utilities sector, which was intended to promote competition and consumer =choice.Among the options the commission has to remedy the situation are a hike in =the utilities' price caps.Even that, however, would constitute a ```band-aid on a bullet wound,''' =said Ron Barone, who leads S&amp;P's utility group and also participated in =the conference call.Californians have already been warned to cut back their energy use, and =that they may be subject to rolling blackouts.Cortright said unless the commission offers the utilities significant =regulatory relief, Pacific G&amp;E and Southern California Edison will be =dependent on the capital markets for cash infusions, if any are available.```There are bills that are coming due in January and February,''' he said. =```We would be naive to think that the capital markets are going to open =their doors to satisfy (their needs) in the current environment.'''```To be frank,''' he added, ```we are amazed that events have been permitted =to reach anywhere near this critical stage. It truly is unfathomable. We =really do need some emergency actions taken now.'''Pacific G&amp;E last completed a big bond sale in October, selling $1.35 =billion of bonds. Southern California Edison and its parent, Edison =International, sold an equivalent amount in early November.Both companies carry ```A-plus''' corporate credit ratings and ```single-A''' =senior unsecured debt ratings. Pacific G&amp;E's secured debt carries an =```AA-minus''' rating. Those ratings are considered mid to high investment =grades.One trader said Southern California Edison's debt began on Tuesday being =quoted by price, like junk bonds, instead of by the extra yield they offer =relative to similar maturity U.S. Treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.Its 5.875 percent notes maturing in September 20004 were quoted Wednesday =at about 87 cents on the dollar, yielding about 111.3 percent to maturity. =No price quotation was immediately available on Pacific G&amp;E's debt.=20\n"

Oct. 16, 2000, 10:35PMArena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders By JANETTE RODRIGUES Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and civic-association members attended an informational meeting and get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. \"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it empowers us,\" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports Authority director. \"It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position.\" George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community. The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a repeat of the 1999 referendum. Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues. The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets the Hispanic community, Postolos said. The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is getting more tangibles this time around. He said, \"When you consider that our community will get 30 percent affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community.\" Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, heard the details of the plan for the first time. \"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild the community,\" she said. \"We want it to be good for the whole, not the few.\" Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. \"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs,\" Barrera said. Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos acknowledged that the team needs to do better.   TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 MlnBy Bryan Lee10/16/2000Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales contract. TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its debt-reduction forecast. According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 2000. TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is under a court protective order. \"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,\" said David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility customers. But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the subject of the claim. TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman said Monday. In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA said Enron sought the court seal. The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest U.S. power producers. The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of 19998 and 1999. After the summer of 19998 - in which power that typically sells for between $30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward. Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across TVA's system. After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests. A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's requests were gathering dust. Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires, 202-862-66647, bryan.lee@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

While itis correct that the CFTC proposes to regulate commodities with exhaustible andnearly inexhaustible supplies differently, it has not characterized power ashaving an inexhaustible supply.   In fact, I would expect the CFTC to treat poweras having a finite supply at any given time.   This means, for example, thatpower derivatives traded on a multilateral transaction execution facility wouldnot qualify for exemption from the Commodity Exchange Act under the currentproposal.   I think the EEI and other industry groups should consider attemptingto persuade the CFTC to exempt physical and derivative power contracts fromcertain provisions of the CEA under the CFTC's proposal to consider exemptionson a \"case-by-case basis.\"   See, for example, the discussion of DTFs on pages 9and 10 of the proposal.   I hope this clarifies the CFTC's proposal.   Regards, PaulPaul J. Pantano, Jr.McDermott, Will &amp; Emery(202) 756-8026***This message is a PRIVATE communication.

Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently hadconfidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires theDWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customersof Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E).Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costsof its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only anallocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUCrecognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered atcertain times.   The PUC makes SCE and PG&amp;E liable to pay any shortfalls toensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, butsuggests it is open to further consideration of this policy.URG Assets Re-RegulatedThe PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings toestablish cost-based rates for their URG.   The rate set will be maderetroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generationinto to the PX, which SCE and PG&amp;E said they stopped doing on 12/28/000.   Thetwo utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-aheadmarkets on 01/19/01.The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-relatedrevenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition CostBalancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.   The TCBA reflects the net bookvalue of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets*stranded costs.   The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandumaccount the difference between this reduced rate of return component ofrevenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for thesame assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.   Theamounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference betweentheir current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had thesegeneration costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemakingin place prior to restructuring.*   The cost-based rates so determined, thePUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just andreasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment.The PUC decides that SCE, PG&amp;E, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) shoulduse their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1)serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell powerat cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3)sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.   The PUCdirects that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered toother California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefitin-state ratepayers.   URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-termpurchased power contracts.Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sellall of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all oftheir energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sellrequirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricingtheir retained generation.   In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because ofthe need to protect the public interest during this time of nearlycontinuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction.The PUC makes SDG&amp;E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUCdoes not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&amp;E, at this time.The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&amp;E*s retail customers from receiving DWRpower, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end therate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis forending the rate freeze.   As far as it addresses the pricing and use ofutilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis forpricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to theircustomers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.Residual Pricing of DWR PowerBecause of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUCadopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as apercentage of what each SCE and PG&amp;E retail end use customer currently paysthem for energy.   The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen atdifferent levels for each utility and each customer class.   The percentageis calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR anddelivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated orpurchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).   The amount ofpower purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others forresale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market.This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily.The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a totalof 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their ratesfor the power they used that day.Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR andhold the amounts in trust for DWR.As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on thebasis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, whilecalculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retailcustomers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s coststo be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for eachMWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges.The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in therecovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the Staterecover the funds expended.*   If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankruptutilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, theseamounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid,overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated.Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power uponresale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs,transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less anyoverpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers.Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain titleto its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, andreminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit northe taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the paymentfor any obligation.*   The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities todeliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take noownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrativecapacity as billing agents for DWR.The PUC*s interim order is posted on its web site at:http:///www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/FINAL_DECISION/4867.htmFor your convenience, attached is an MS Rich Text Format file containingthis analysis and full summary.Citation: The PUC approved its interim order, Decision 01-01-061, adoptingemergency regulations on the delivery and payment mechanism for DWR powerand directing utilities on the use and pricing of utility retainedgeneration on January 31, 20001, in SCE and PG&amp;E*s consolidated ratestabilization cases, Application numbers 000-111-038 and 000-111-056, of whichSDG&amp;E is a party. - TEXT.htm - CAPUCAdoptsDWRRegulationsFulSum.rtf\n"

Under the provisions of AB 1X, which the PUC apparently hadconfidence would be enacted without significant change, the PUC requires theDWR to sell the power it purchases directly to the retail end use customersof Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E).Since the law requires the PUC to ensure that DWR recovers all of the costsof its power purchase program and yet also limits the recovery to only anallocable portion of the utilities* currently frozen energy charges, the PUCrecognizes the possibility that DWR*s costs may not be fully recovered atcertain times.   The PUC makes SCE and PG&amp;E liable to pay any shortfalls toensure DWR recovers its costs on as current a basis as possible, butsuggests it is open to further consideration of this policy.URG Assets Re-RegulatedThe PUC orders the three utilities to each make *Advice Letter* filings toestablish cost-based rates for their URG.   The rate set will be maderetroactive to whenever the utility stopped bidding its retained generationinto to the PX, which SCE and PG&amp;E said they stopped doing on 12/28/000.   Thetwo utilities said they stopped participating in the PX day-of and day-aheadmarkets on 01/19/01.The PUC directs the utilities to calculate their cost of capital-relatedrevenue requirements using the amounts in their respective Transition CostBalancing Accounts (TCBA) as the rate base.   The TCBA reflects the net bookvalue of utility generation assets less the recovery of those assets*stranded costs.   The PUC will allow utilities to record in a memorandumaccount the difference between this reduced rate of return component ofrevenue requirements and their last PUC authorized rate of return for thesame assets, for possible future use in adjusting the TCBA-based rates.   Theamounts in these memorandum accounts will represent the difference betweentheir current allowed returns and what they *may have earned had thesegeneration costs been recovered under traditional cost of service ratemakingin place prior to restructuring.*   The cost-based rates so determined, thePUC says, would comply with the principle that ratepayers pay just andreasonable rates, and as costs change would be subject to adjustment.The PUC decides that SCE, PG&amp;E, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) shoulduse their *utility retained generation* (URG) in the following order, to: 1)serve their existing customers at cost-of-service based rates; 2) sell powerat cost-based rates to other California investor-owned utilities; and 3)sell or barter excess power from URG to minimize future costs.   The PUCdirects that if any surplus generation exists, it should first be offered toother California IOUs at cost-based rates, with any net proceeds to benefitin-state ratepayers.   URG consists of utility-owned generation and long-termpurchased power contracts.Since the December 15, 2000 order from the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (FERC) ending the investor-owned utilities* obligation to sellall of their energy produced through the Power Exchange (PX) and buy all oftheir energy requirements from the PX (the so-called *buy/sellrequirement*), utilities had no regulatory direction for using and pricingtheir retained generation.   In lieu of an evidentiary hearing, because ofthe need to protect the public interest during this time of nearlycontinuous Stage 3 supply emergencies, the PUC now provides this direction.The PUC makes SDG&amp;E a party to the URG aspects of its order, while the PUCdoes not apply the DWR delivery and pricing rules to SDG&amp;E, at this time.The AB 1X law does not exclude SDG&amp;E*s retail customers from receiving DWRpower, but the PUC opts not to require DWR power to go them at this time.In this interim order adopted on 01/31/01, the PUC says it does not end therate freeze, set an interim valuation, or otherwise provide a basis forending the rate freeze.   As far as it addresses the pricing and use ofutilities* retained generation, the order only sets an interim basis forpricing the power utilities continue to produce and provide to theircustomers since the effectively defunct PX no longer fulfills this function.Residual Pricing of DWR PowerBecause of the provisions of AB 1X, which was enacted the day after the PUCadopted its order, the PUC must price DWR power residually, or as apercentage of what each SCE and PG&amp;E retail end use customer currently paysthem for energy.   The utilities* energy charges are currently frozen atdifferent levels for each utility and each customer class.   The percentageis calculated by dividing (1) the amount of power provided by DWR anddelivered by the utility, by (2) the total amount of power generated orpurchased by the utility and the amount of power in item (1).   The amount ofpower purchased by the utility includes purchases from QFs and others forresale, as well as any energy they purchase in the ISO*s real time market.This percentage or ratio will be calculated daily.The PUC provides the following example, if a utility generates and purchases750 MWh of power and delivers along with it 250 MWh of DWR power for a totalof 1,000 MWh, each customer owes DWR 25% of the energy charge in their ratesfor the power they used that day.Utilities will collect these amounts from customers on behalf of DWR andhold the amounts in trust for DWR.As the law requires the calculation of the amounts to be collected on thebasis of the megawatt hours DWR actually purchases and delivers, whilecalculating the amounts it is entitled to recover from utilities* retailcustomers in dollars of costs, there is a built in potential for DWR*s coststo be under recovered, depending on how the actual price DWR pays for eachMWh matches up with the utilities* existing, frozen energy charges.The PUC says that making the utilities liable for any shortfall in therecovery of DWR*s costs *satisfies the legislative concern that the Staterecover the funds expended.*   If the two cash-strapped, nearly bankruptutilities are liable for substantial amounts to make DWR whole, theseamounts would likely only add to the approximately $12 billion in unpaid,overdue purchased power costs they have already accumulated.Following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC sets the DWR price of power uponresale as equal to DWR*s purchased power costs, plus administrative costs,transmission and scheduling costs, and other related costs, less anyoverpayments DWR may subsequently recover from suppliers.Again following the provisions of AB 1X, the PUC directs DWR to retain titleto its power until sold to the utilities* retail end use customers, andreminds that under the new statute *neither the full faith and credit northe taxing power of the State of California may be pledged for the paymentfor any obligation.*   The PUC orders the two cash-strapped utilities todeliver DWR power to retail customers and directs the utilities to take noownership or other interest in DWR power, acting only in an administrativecapacity as billing agents for DWR.The PUC*s interim order is posted on its web site at:http:///www.cpuc.ca.gov/PUBLISHED/FINAL_DECISION/4867.htmFor your convenience, attached is an MS Rich Text Format file containingthis analysis and full summary.Citation: The PUC approved its interim order, Decision 01-01-061, adoptingemergency regulations on the delivery and payment mechanism for DWR powerand directing utilities on the use and pricing of utility retainedgeneration on January 31, 20001, in SCE and PG&amp;E*s consolidated ratestabilization cases, Application numbers 000-111-038 and 000-111-056, of whichSDG&amp;E is a party. - TEXT.htm - CAPUCAdoptsDWRRegulationsFulSum.rtf\n"

EEI meeting in D.C.This term was literally \"borrowed\" from the ISDA Agreement.The definition used in the ISDA Credit Support Annex is as follows:\"Independent Amount\" means, with respect to a party, the amount specified assuch for that party in Paragraph 13; if no amount is specified, zero.(The ISDA Paragraph 13 is synonymous with the EEI Cover Sheet)There isn't a \"definition\" per se.   The term comes into play in 8.3 as it isadded to the Termination Payment and compared to the Collateral Threshold.   Toput it in another way, it acts as \"buffer\" Termination Payment to handleadditional potential credit exposure created by transactions valued againstextremely volatile price indices.Please call me in Houston should you have additional questions (713) 207-12111.Thanks,Randy - intoproduct2.ppt - examples.ppt\n"

Also, Whalley will be \"   \"   (I'm checking what his title will be and I'll call you so we can finalize and you can initial it).Second,   the LT purchase agreement that was filed at FERC between EPMI and SCC was a power purchase agreement.   The new agreement is a tolling agreement whereby EPMI delivers gas to Brownsville Power.   Would EPMI transport the gas on the pipeline?   or would ECT?   Several months ago, Stacy Dickson called and asked me if I knew whether EPMI could buy natural gas or transport natural gas   (as opposed to ECT, which does this under the FERC blanket, I think).   I told her that I didn't know and she said she didn't think that the particular deal she was working on would be structured with EPMI, so not to look into this.   Therefore, as I recall, I did not get an answer to this.   I also have not looked into the gas side of Genco (see note below).   I thought that Becky Cantrell and Julie Gomez handle the gas side for ECT.   If you want me to check into this type of question on the gas side, let me know.   I can also ask Sam B. who may know right away.   (I have not worked on the gas marketing side, just the pipes, so I would need to look this up.)   ---",

      "body": "\nEPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price.   Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,   this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).   Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE \"the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate\".   What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap.I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE.   If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $5000 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me.   Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are \"artificially\" determined after the trade was entered into.   While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE.   I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this.   So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue.   Thanks for your thoughts.\n"

This means that my boss will now be Jim Fallon rather than Greg Whalley.   I met with both Greg and Jim when I was in Houston last week.   Greg was very complimentary of the work that we've done here.   Greg has become extremely busy since his responsibilities have expanded from North American trading to risk management worldwide.   Accordingly, he thought that it made the most sense to consolidate the power trading functions in North America under one person.Jim was also very complimentary of our work.   We have been profitable for 6 straight quarters ---   exceeded plan in 19998 and have exceeded plan in Q1 and Q2 of 1999.   He wants to see this success continue.   Jim expects to spend at least one day out of every two weeks up here.   I am looking forward to working with Jim.   He has done an outstanding job running the east power desk.   This should enable us to increase coordination between the two groups and allow us to have a strong advocate in Houston.   While it's too early to say anything definitively, I don't expect much to change on a day to day basis here.   If anyone has any questions please don't hesitate to ask.\n"

On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday morning in San Diego.Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold in the state. An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable to comment. The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

        " Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT on 02/20/20001 02:20 PM ---\t\"JOHN G KLAUBERG\" &lt;JKLAUBER@LLGM.COM&lt;\t02/18/20001 05:46 PM \t\t\t To: Elizabeth.Sager@enron.com\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: MPLP PPA DisputePRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCTDO NOT DISTRIBUTEElizabeth:I looked through the CMS PPA on my return flight to NY.   While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for a few days.   I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.   Also, I'll have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper.   (See   attached).   At this point, however, I'm not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis.   You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.   As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.Preliminary Overall AssessmentThe PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.   While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basis---which generally supports MPLP's position---the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 1\" only would apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 35\" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract Term.   The anomaly \"running in the other direction\" is that, under CMS's interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis (e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would be applied \"mid-stream\" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged \"contract year\" ).   My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly (described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year concept (i.e., the 21 month \"Year 35\" issue) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around...More Information/Diligence/ResearchBefore a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you forwarded):---The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) in a published Order.   Was there anything in that Order or the submissions (or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide some guidance?---My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance where the COD was not a Jan.1.   Do we (or local counsel) know whether this may be a \"global\" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?---While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the \"excess\" capacity payments from its customers---so that it presumably would have to issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.---CMS \"self bills\" itself under the PPA.   Has the statute of limitations run on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?   Can CMS's prior course of dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior \"overpayments\" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity payments)?   (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis only).---The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.   Isn't this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any particular period?   Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the \"excess\" amount in rates?---Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the PUC?   If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall restructuring of the PPA?Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position---The definition of \"Contract Capacity Factor\" provides for a calendar year determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar year.   If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.---Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D \"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows... The capacity charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined...   (Emphasis added).   This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next anniversary of the COD.   It arguably would not appear to make any sense to apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not require an adjustment. ---NOTE:   The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only pertains to the computation of a percentage \"haircut\" or adjustment that is applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.   That is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in conflict with the rest of the PPA.---Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 years \"and thereafter from year to year,\" unless a party gives at least one year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective \"at the end of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter.\" (Emphasis added).   Thus, for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term---i.e., October 31, 2030---a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 (i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).   Thus, the PPA contemplates in certain respects certain \"stub\" years and certain \"long\" years, a contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D.---There are other calendar year based obligations---for e.g., Sec. 13 (and Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a calendar year basis.   (We should discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be additional support in that respect).   (Note that some other calendar year based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can still be used to reflect the underlying \"calendar year\" flavor of the PPA since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).A Few Additional Points to Note---The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 20001 (plus interest as provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.---Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an \"indication\" of a regulatory disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10&amp;copy; as a way to attempt to force its \"contract year\" interpretation of Exhibit D.   While Sec. 10&amp;copy; is one of those \"old school\" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of the PUC to support its contract claim.   (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).Let me know when you wish to follow up.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

Assuming the meeting stays scheduled, I will schedule an internal meeting to briefly go over the EEI Into definition before we meet with Dynegy.As you are aware, in connection with the EEI effort we worked extensively with a large group of industry participants to define   what an Into Product is.   Dynegy and PECO were the two companies that were very outspoken against they way the product ultimately got defined.   Dynegy put on a big dog and pony show before a large group of industry participants trying to argue that EEI's Into product was flawed.   Their position, while not completely expressed, hinges on the concept that if you sell an Into Product and are making deliveries on firm transmission, then the Seller will always be excused from performance if the firm transmission gets cut for any reason (in general, this is contrary to EEI which obligates the Seller to go to another interface unless the cut was due to Buyer's use of non firm transmission when firm was available or due to Buyer's attempt to move the energy away from the receiving control area).   Dynegy's approach was driven by the fact that they have extensive generation and that the vast majority of their deals go physical.   At the time, we suggested that if they were worried about cuts in firm transmission, then they needed to sell a transmission contingent product.   Dynegy's concept was rejected at the EEI meetings.I hope that the meeting will accomplish the following goals:1.   Get Dynegy to agree to trade Into with us under a common Into definition - Dynegy will not sign an EEI with us because of the Into definition.   We trade Into extensively with them, but clearly do not have a common understanding of what we are trading.   Critical to clear up this ambiguity.2. Secure Dynegy as an advocate of EEI - Because Dynegy was so vocal against EEI's Into definition, if they now started using EEI, it would further boost acceptance of the contract and isolate PECO as the only other major voice against the Into definition.3. Reexamine the Into Product as it is currently drafted and consider what will happen as access to transmission changes - Because the Into product is such an important part of East trading today, it is critical that internally we all agree how it should operate. Additionally, it is critical that we start thinking about how the Into product will be affected by changes in transmission, such as the advent of RTOs (with long term Into deals we may want to consider addressing what happens if the receiving control area goes into an RTO)Call me with any questions/thoughts.ThanksElizabeth 36349\n"

Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly quantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on updated forwards).   They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug at this time.   They seem to have gotten their act a little better together this time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would still need to be approved by the NHPUC.Here's the scoop on timeline:They will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.   We need to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.   Elizabeth, does this fit your schedule OK?They plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday Apr 10th, and hope to close   a deal that same day.   Again, this deal would be subject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC disapproval.Tracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint.   Is letter of credit sufficient in their case?   Can we talk about what we need to put in place for the transaction.I will be in Houston on Weds-Fri of this week (Elizabeth and Tracy --- I'll be sure to swing by and introduce myself).   Thanks much and I'll forward the contract when I get it.Regards,John\n"

A power struggle has begun, despite the fact that most traders,&lt; preschedulers and trading managers aren't even aware of the new contract.&lt;   Southern Co. (SO) Vice President Bobby Campo has been a leader in WSPP&lt; since the organization's inception and has been chairman of its contract&lt; committee for four years. Yet Southern Co. Energy Marketing's chief&lt; counsel, Sonnet Edmonds, is a leader in the rival-contract faction.&lt;   Will EEI, along with its comrade, the National Energy Marketers&lt; Association, manage to dethrone the WSPP contract or crash? WSPP's raison&lt; d'etre is to manage and promote use of its contract, which is traded&lt; extensively in the West and has gained proponents in the East.&lt;   \"I'm not real excited about it right now,\" Campo said of the new&lt; contract. \"The EEI contract is being done by contract people and lawyers.&lt; We - operators and power marketers - worked on our contract for years&lt; before we brought in the lawyers. It (the new contract) may die from a&lt; lack&lt; of interest from participants, but EEI has the ability to keep it alive.\"&lt;   It isn't clear if the big power marketing companies will get the ball&lt; rolling by asking counterparties to switch to the EEI contract. Edmonds&lt; hopes that Southern Co. will do so.&lt;   \"Management hasn't given the official word yet, but we participated in&lt; its development, so I imagine we'll use it at some point,\" she said.&lt;   Enron Corp.'s (ENE) general counsel also worked on the EEI contract, but&lt; the company hasn't made a decision to actually use it.&lt;   Entergy Corp.'s (ETR) general counsel, Christopher Bernard, led the&lt; effort to develop the new contract as head of NEM's standardized contract&lt; committee. But Entergy's Jim Kenney is chairman of WSPP's executive&lt; committee. Entergy's power trading managers, meanwhile, haven't even read&lt; the new contract yet.&lt;   Duke Power Co. (DUK), an NEM member, is looking at it, a spokesman said.&lt; Enron and Southern Co. aren't NEM members, though they serve on its&lt; contract committee.&lt;   Several sources said American Electric Power (AEP) has agreed to be the&lt; guinea pig, and plans to switch to the EEI contract with counterparties on&lt; eastern U.S. trades. A spokesman for the utility couldn't confirm or deny&lt; that rumor because Paul Addis, president of AEP Energy Services, has&lt; imposed a vow of silence on AEP's traders.&lt;   There are elements of the EEI contract that power marketers may like.&lt; One&lt; innovation is a new product called \"Firm (No Force Majeure),\" which&lt; requires the payment of liquidated damages for failure to deliver - no&lt; excuses, no force majeure, just send a check.&lt;   The new contract also has two other firm products. \"Firm (Liquidated&lt; Damages)\" is closest to the WSPP firm product, but it defines force&lt; majeure&lt; more strictly than WSPP. \"Firm (LD-System Reliability)\" explicitly allows&lt; a&lt; selling utility to curtail deliveries without paying liquidated damages if&lt; necessary to maintain native load. Of particular interest to traders of&lt; eastern U.S. electricity is the fact that the EEI contract defines what an&lt; \"into\" product is.&lt;   WSPP has debated the introduction of such products, but in the end has&lt; tried to come up with a single, agreed-upon product for trading.&lt;   \"EEI has created a lot of different types of firm products, but that can&lt; create problems. Many people have said 'no, we want one firm product',\"&lt; said WSPP's counsel, Michael Small, of Washington, D.C., law firm Wright&lt; and Talisman.&lt;   So why didn't the EEI group just work with WSPP to get changes made to&lt; the existing standard? Too much bureaucracy, according to Southern's&lt; Edmonds.&lt;   \"Changes to the WSPP contract require approval from 90% of the members,&lt; after working through the operations committee and the executive&lt; committee.&lt; Then the changes have to be filed at Federal Energy Regulatory&lt; Commission,\"&lt; Edmonds said.&lt;   Coincidentally, WSPP's executive committee is meeting Friday in San&lt; Diego&lt; to discuss what changes are needed in the definition of its firm product.&lt; Western utilities are pushing hard for \"firm\" to mean backed up by&lt; reserves&lt; of generating assets or previously purchased power. In other words, some&lt; utilities want to eliminate short positions from power markets.&lt;   At least one power marketing company, which didn't want to be named,&lt; will&lt; switch to the EEI contract if that change gets made to WSPP.&lt;   For the EEI contract to fly, not only will the lawyers at the big&lt; trading&lt; companies need to make it their companies' standard, but traders will have&lt; to convince utilities to abandon most, if not all, force majeure claims.&lt; Many municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives are forbidden to&lt; do so by state regulations.&lt;   For traders, though, the biggest adjustment to make if the EEI contract&lt; does take off will be more social than professional. The semi-annual&lt; meeting of the WSPP's operations committee is as much fun as any blatant&lt; boondoggle should be. The serious work of a handful of committee members&lt; is&lt; a small hook on which hangs the revelry of hundreds of power marketers,&lt; brokers and utility staffers. As it stands, non-committee members must&lt; have&lt; a hard time convincing bosses that their presence is necessary at the&lt; meeting.&lt;   How on earth will traders justify going if the WSPP contract is no&lt; longer&lt; used? Can EEI throw a good party? And how will the Gucci-loafered EEI&lt; executives from Washington handle $1,000 dares to go naked in a bar?&lt;   Such are the questions now vexing America's electric utilities.&lt;   -By Mark Golden; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604;&lt; mark.golden@dowjones.com&lt;&lt;   (END) Dow Jones Newswires   111-19-999&lt;   1520EST\n"

Also, I called Dynegy at Mark's request and they very much want to participate as well - Harlan Murphy called me afterwards to ask that he also get notice of the meetings because they fully support the idea of one Master for all trades.   I will get Genia to forward Harlan's address info to you.   Thanks for your help.Elizabeth 36349PS Mark At the EEI meeting last week there was a fair bit of discussion about cross defaulting all commodity lines and using a single master for all trades.

PCA claims that EPMI owes PCA $15,126,4445.16 for damages resulting from EPMI's wrongful termination of transactions in June 19998.   This amount appears to be based on PCA's calculation of the forward values of the terminated trades, and certain \"preference payments\" that PCA claims were made to EPMI.   This claim is in its preliminary stages.   I will update you with further information as soon as we get a handle on what the Trustee is really seeking.   As you will remember, we currently have a proof of claim pending against PCA for over $5 million dollars representing our unpaid receivable amount.BillIn connection with this matter, it would be very helpful if you could have someone gather the following information:1.   Date and amount of last payment made by PCA, splitting the relative net amounts owed to and from EPMI (I would assume that payment for April deliveries was made - accordingly, I would assume that the last payment we received from PCA would have been around May 20th).2.   Total amount of MWH delivered to PCA but for which PCA never paid for.3.   The details of how you calculated the net MTM exposure of the terminated transactions (pursuant to an email to me dated July 27, 19998 you had calculated the MTM as of July 7, 19998 at $3,7772,939)As always, thanks for your help.\n"

We have not yet made demand on the parent but could do so after PGE or its other unregulated subsidiaries failed to pay amounts due.   Exposures are approximate as of 1/19/01.   Before terminating, we would need to verify actual contract language.B.   SCE DefaultSCE is in default of a contract between SCE and EPMI relating to   a power sales position which is out of the money to EPMI approximately ($35 million) based upon SCE's failure to make payments on debt in excess of $1000 million. Under contract we could suspend deliveries (limited period) and then terminate and accelerate amounts due.

For each product line,   I thought we could attach all the relevant information (I'm not sure if this is making it too easy for the court but it seems like the right thing to do). Each commodity line then would assemble the following and attach as an Appendix to the letter:1.   Copy of Master Contract or applicable GTC2.   Copy of transaction confirmations3.   Copy of termination notice sent to PG&amp;E4.   Chart summarizing key commercial terms of transaction(s)5.   Chart summarizing unpaid receivables and invoices for same6.

I also plan to periodically discuss my performance with the other attorneys I am assigned to.   I feel that by staying completely on top of the situation, I will greatly improve my working relationship with you and my other assignments.

The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that the California Energy Commission (\"CEC\") and three California UDC's would divert payments they were otherwise   required to make to a blackballed ESP into the infamous \"Lockbox.\"   The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to swear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and dribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.   Also,   the mili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent \"Security Interest\" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds and this security interest was for our benefit.   Although I am proud to have the   name Yoder associated with the Lockbox concept,   I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal using the damn thing.   Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known for his patience with the legal process,   and later,   John \"Big Sky\" Malowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but alas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.   Good luck and let me know if I can help out in any way with your project.---cgy \n"

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any \" future California\", we propose the following changes:1.   Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All Commodities --- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading contracts.   Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.2.   Mandatory Master Netting Agreements For Counterparties With Multiple Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures --- where it is necessary to have multiple masters with a counterparty, a \"bridge\" should be put place between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under the two or more masters.3.   Merge EPMI into ENA --- power trades are done through EPMI.   Merging EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient from both a credit and legal point of view.4.   No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event --- Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts or entities through which we conduct our trading.   I believe these changes will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (ii) develop the opportunity to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv)substanially improve Enron's position in the next California type market.   The long range goal is conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a single entity and a single or limited number standardized agreements.\n"

I would appreciateyour review and comments on the following as a definition for Firm Power for usein the WSPP Agreement in lieu of the current language.   This language would beinserted in Schedule C and replace Sections C-3.3 and C-3.6:   Firm Power shall be interrupted only if the interruption is: (a) due to an   Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement and power   is not available at the Delivery Point; or, (b) where applicable, to meet   Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.   If   Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or   statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages   for failure to deliver Firm Power as provided in Section 21.3 of this   Agreement or in any Confirmation Agreement.   If Firm Power is interrupted   for any reason other than as provided in subpart (a) above, the   non-performing party shall be obligated to pay damages under this Agreement   or Confirmation Agreement.\n"

Agency - Several of our major trading partners operate through an agent acting on behalf of several operating companies. This creates uncertainty as to which entity is liable for which trades.3. Municipalities - Difficult authorization issues associated municipalities.4.Complexity of transactions - Power transactions can be very complex as a result, in part, of difficult delivery mechanics and volatile pricing.5.Timing of transactions - Power transactions typically must be completed on a very tight time schedule.6. Lawyer Training - Difficult, time consuming process to train lawyers on how to document transactions involving power.7.Process for approval of transactions - Uncertain procedures for making sure everybody understands risks associated with transactions.Documentation Projects1.

Another \"group\" to which I believethat we should emphasize our marketing efforts includes the online tradingplatforms.Three types of online trading platforms presently exist: (1)proprietaryexchanges (EnronOnline, Dynegydirect); (2) consortium platforms (ICEX); and(3) independent, third-party platform (Altra) [these platforms are similarto (2)but differ in that the shareholders/backers have not committedliquidity].   The volumes traded on these types of electric platforms aresignificant and growing.   According to MegawattDaily, Ameren Energyconductsabout 40% of next-day deals and 30% of forwards on various electronicplatforms.   There are presently close to 25 platforms (of course, with somany competitors, as usually happens, there will probably be a weeding outand/or consolidations/mergers...the Jurassic period notwithstanding, asblame for the mass dinosaur extinction lay with an errant meteor orpossiblythe taking up of cigarette smoking by the majority of the dinosaursaccording to Larsen...all apologies for the joke).As each platform system has different definitions, products, and contracts,and as several of the platforms are considering adopting standardcontracts,I believe an opportunity exists to push the EEI as either the exclusivestandard agreement used for trading on a particular platform or as adefaultagreement for those proprietary and other platforms under which tradingpartners lack executed Masters with the counterparty.   In fact, accordingtopublished sources, Houston Street, RedMeteor, and others have been workingwith others for several months on developing industry standards.Just a thought.Babak---Original Message---From: Andy Katz [mailto:AKatz@eei.org]Sent: Thursday, October 26, 2000 3:54 PMTo: fmdutton@aep.com; hemu@dynegy.com; elizabeth.sager@enron.com;bbrou91@entergy.com; mroger3@entergy.com; wfhenze@jonesday.com;dperlman@powersrc.com; rosteen@powersrc.com; drusso@reliantenergy.com;pdondanville@schiffhardin.com; babak.pooya@southernenergy.comSubject: Oct 13 Meeting Follow-UpSome random thoughts:There was a teleconference today regarding the credit annex.   Bill McCoyshould have draft language by early next week.   This draft only addressesEEI transactions, but could easily be expanded to transactions under othermaster agreements.   I will circulate Bill's draft as soon as I get it.Randy Baker &amp; Michelle McLendin (Duke), and Lisa Grof &amp; Frank Hilton (AEP)have volunteered to work on the on the credit annex subcommittee.According to my notes, assignments for the remaining optional provisionsareas follows:1) Incorporating old   trades - Elizabeth2) One-way transactions - Buddy3) New products e.g. Western Firm/CAISO - Dede &amp; Elizabeth4) Regulatory Out - John Crespo &amp; Randy Osteen5) New taxes - Fritz6) ADR - Patty7) Agency relationship - Elizabeth8) Electronic Exchanges - BabakAdditional provisions9) Credit Annex - Bill McCoy, et al.10) incorporating prior trades not under netting, Frank Stllingwerf111) Broker Confirmations ?12) Over Deliveries - Phyliss LemelWhat kind of deadline for these assignments is realistic?Randy Osteen &amp; I plan to meet next w/ week to start planning the workshopinAtlanta we plan to hold at the end of January.

Are you supporting the use of EEI in Canada.   I think I have our Canadian office convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to \"Canadianize\" it, thereby creating an EEI Canadian.

Since this deal started in Sept. they have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.   They are currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on another.   They have failed to come up with $ despite two \"heart-to-heart\" discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.   Stone and Webster, the firm building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.   They seem disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.   If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.

If PECOwants to continue to explore the transmission points, or other FERCpolicy points they no doubt will, but I don't think they go on theagenda, and certainly not first.I think it would be very important to attach current productsdefinitions to the agenda, and would therefore plead with Liz and Martyto see if we can get those implemented and to Andy for distribution byFriday.   Also, Mitch Dutton was the one with custody of the System Firmdefinition, and I will call him today to see if he can get it massagedand to Andy by Friday morning.   I'd love to have a discussion, with traders present, about thebookout issue, but I don't know if we'll have time.   The other \"global\"issue that the traders need to focus on (and will no doubt want anupdate on) is the status of the efforts to get FERC on board.   Andy, canwe at least give them tentatively that we WILL meet with FERC staff inJanuary, and the tentative dates of the rollout sessions on the contractin Houston and New York?   PD&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;HEMU@dynegy.com&lt; Tuesday, December 07, 1999 &lt;&lt;&lt;Please take a look at this and give me your thoughts.   One area that Ibelieveneeds more work in particular is the item referring to FERC policies; Ithinkthis is PECO's issue, but I'm not sure what FERC policies they areconcernedabout.I would like to attach the current definitions of the products to theagenda.Do we have a definition of the \"Into ___\" product that has been updatedsince theNovember 9 conference call?   Is there a new defintion of the \"Firm(LD-SystemReliability)\" product?What about trying to tackle bookouts if we have the time?   Is thereanyconceivable way we will have the time?Thanks,Harlan(See attached file: EEI-NEMA AGENDA.DOC)\n"

Please read the attached and confirm that this is your understanding of the   PGET/EPMI/ EEMC assignment.   I am also at this time forwarding to the working group my four main points, which I think reflect my main areas of concern under the drafts:1.   I would like to say   that   the price is the same under the transactions.   Transaction costs should be dealt with separately. 2. While we have agreed to take a pass through of the bankruptcy risk,   this draft provides that we take on all contract dispute risk.   As I understand it, EPMI intends to pass through all risk, such as change in delivery point risk, under the contract.   Since EPMI is our sole provider of power to EES (other than   the PGET contract), EPMI is in the best position to manage   general contract risk with its counterparties, as it does today with all our physical electricity purchases.   EPMI may   have disputes under contracts for many reasons that EEMC is not aware of and will not be in a position to influence once the contracts are   assigned to Avista.3. I assume if EPMI   trades out of   these positions as it manages its own portfolio, the credit risk would not follow to subsequent counterparties and the EPMI/EEES confirm terms would revert to typical confirm language.4.   I was operating under the assumption that the tax issue would be resolved with Steve Douglass prior to signing the main documents.   I am not sure whether this issue can be quantified by EES tax today.   Any suggestions or ability to resolve/quantify today?   Same concern for the accounting issues.   My concern here is that if the transaction leaves us in a worse economic position as a result of making EPMI whole, this would need to be addressed with our business people.

PG&amp;E revised the Total Volume to 981,6000 MWh.   Avista didnot respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.   Our records showthat the original volume of 982,4000 is correct (there was a leap-year day inyear 2000).   The broker confirm and the PG&amp;E revision seem to be both inerror.   Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy andEnron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.   Since thisAssignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommendslanguage to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email fromBlair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&amp;E andEnron? Please advise.(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a TotalVolume of 14,4000.   PG&amp;E accepted the confirm \"as is.\"   The brokerconfirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.   Therefore, bothPG&amp;E and AVISTA screwed up.   HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh'sshould correctly be as per the broker confirmation.   Again, our counselrecommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (seemail from Blair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable toPG&amp;E and Enron?   Please advise.To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enronand Avista.   Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron'sconfirm's prevail).   Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.   Wewould like to see those confirms in advance if possible.Lastly, time is of the essense.   We are scheduling power already for Januarydeliveries...therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as toprevent any problems with scheduling, etc.   I suppose that we could delaythe start dates to February 1st, 20001 if necessary.   Perhaps not a bigissue.Thanks,Nolan SteinerPh: 509-495-81999---Original Message---From: R.

I agree with your assessment.   Unfortunately, caps are not disruptions but have become a normal course of business.From: Elizabeth Sager on 07/13/2000 01:41 PM CDTTo: Kevin M Presto/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Index TransactionsEPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a floating, published index price.   Our physical contract does not currently provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,   this is addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).   Under ENA's standard contract for financial trading, there is included as a MDE \"the imposition of trading limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate\".   What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price would have been without the cap.I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap on power prices a MDE.   If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of prices to $5000 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with litigation risk to me.   Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you would always settle against the published prices, even if they are \"artificially\" determined after the trade was entered into.   While caps are not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps be considered a MDE.   I have spoken with the financial trading group and they will follow our lead on this.   So, depending upon what you both think, we will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this issue.   Thanks for your thoughts.\n"

Is this OK?The A attachment is now inserted with the annual report and Jeff Hodge is providing Q.   \tFrom:   Christi L Nicolay   01/21/2000 04:47 PM To: James D Steffes/HOU/EEES@EES, Tom Chapman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Daniel Allegretti/HOU/EEES@EES, Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Zurita/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Maine retail license for EPMIHere are comments on the draft:12.   \"Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or Maine customers:\"   The draft says \"N/A\".   Shouldn't we put in Houston office?   Dan A's office?13.   Customer rep. ---Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.   Who will be ENA's?15.   Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in these jurisdictions?   Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.   Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I think) are made by EPMI.   There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by EPMI, I think.21.   EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been involved in civil legal actions.   However, does this really request any civil cases?   Can we answer by saying \"no enforcement proceedings by any state in which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?\" Tom, The application says \"Q\" is attached as other supporting material, but I can't find Q.   Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 19998 as \"A\", but I am not sure where it should go (\"A\" is already answered.)Thanks for the information.\n"

      "body": "\nOne hundred and forty two hours ago, I wandered into the Houston Casino, not really sure why other than a free floating anxiety that could only be appeased by attending to the ministerial tasks in life that so frequently make us forget how good life is.   So after a rousing game of tennis on Friday morning while my children were frolicking with Dede's 3 children at the Houston Country Club, I tackled my desk and made head way to no where. After trashing 457 emails, I opened the the 458th.   And then it came to me.   An epic. A history. A sense of time, commitment and value. A place where my roots are (as you all know, my mom and dad are buried in a family graveyard 2000 feet from the only barn not burned in the Shenandoah valley during the Civil War and which was used a Yankee hospital).   And of course there is the hope of sustaining energy to cope with this lackluster, stressful career in the Casino. And the Gods must have seen this coming too.   Being meager and always wanting to commit small, I sought only volume 1 of the opus.   Not to be found.   Plenty of volume 2s and 3s but not a volume 1 to be found.   Other than in the sole, 3 volume set, neatly packages in the box, high up on a lonely shelf.   I knew I was on the right track when the person behind me tried to grab it out of my hands.   I fought and won.I'm now on page 32 having met Jefferson Davis and Dear Abe.   At this rate I'll be finished in about 4 years, a true history of the war.May Shelby be with us all   providing sustaining ...es\tChristian Yoder\t04/16/20001 111:12 AM \t\t\t To: Genia FitzGerald/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Re: Notice of flare up of Civil War imageryI'm sure there's a scholar out there who has already published that big magnum opus on \"Dogs in the Civil War.\"   However, Shelby Foote doesn't mention a single dog in his work and so the topic hasn't entered my imagination.   Your name is Patrick Cleburne.   I'm sorry about the gender thing, but your spirit and behavior is the same as his and you're going to have to go through this reading cycle bearing my comments about his behavior. I'll try to work in some dog analogies if I can.   Cleburne was a German Shepherd if there ever was one.   I would have hated to be across that line looking at his formation over there.   ---cgyFrom: Genia FitzGerald on 04/16/20001 07:43 AM CDTTo: Christian Yoder/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Notice of flare up of Civil War imagery   Christian,Isn't there some canine hero/heroine that is mentioned in one of the history books?

His rash temper caused him to play directly into Lincoln's hand and forever after it would be said:   \"The South started the war.\"   On this anniversary day, Clyde Durham, itinerant journeyman energy attorney,   touches off his third consecutive reading of Shelby Foote's great American Iliad about that war, this reading giving him more sustaining energy to cope with his lacklustre, stressful career in the Casino than any other theraputic activity he has yet found.   The Civil War imagery and analogies   will be flowing soon.   I see Elizabeth as a daughter of old Virginia with the Sager homestead right there in the Valley where much of the action took place.   I'm not sure where your folks would have fit in Genia, but you will soon be   assigned the proxy name I can't think of at the moment, the Irish warrior who fought for the South.   Unfortunately I am on the North side.   I hope this won't cause serious professional difficulties for us as we wade through the epic battles and their respective corporate analogies. ---cgy \n"

      "body": "\nPeter, just a follow-up to your email.1.   I would agree that OPG is mistaken.   After the meeting, Chris and I and others started the process of explaining to Joel Sheinfied, a contract administrator, why deliveries in a pool situation were not just financial settlements but involved a physical commitment to deliver or cause to be delivered power.   On this issue I think it would be helpful to present OPG w/ a product definition that works with the physical master.   I know Chris is already working on this.   From what it sounds like, the Ontario pool is not that different from NEPOOL.   In UI, Chris worked on a product definition that you could incorporate into the physical master.2. I also agree that in pools, a fm will only exist when the pool fails and there are no deliveries capable of being made (not a single MW flowing).   This is what we did in UI.   This is what we do in the California pool.   This is what we attempt to do in NEPOOL.   I think the EEI fm gets you to the same place (nobody could call fm if the pool were making deliveries) but agree that the language could be more direct.   With the California product (CAISO energy) we expressly modify the EEI fm since there are so many other things we also have to fix.   We likely in the future will also modify fm for the NEPOOL product but we are still trying to introduce so many other products in the US that this is a change for the near future.   In general, fm is unique to the product and I believe will change with each product.   When Chris and I were talking to OPG we told them that the fm we would be proposing for the Ontario product would be just as you stated:   Fm is only possible if the pool fails.   Just FYI, the god awful \"Into\"product in the US was created by Enron for the very reason you stated: we wanted to eliminate fm risk in a non-pool market - we did this by obligating the seller to continuously be required to change delivery points (and not be allowed to call a fm) within the defined control area if for any reason the prescheduled delivery point was unavailable.   \n"

I only raised the issue last week because the scope of arbitration came up in another case and we were uncertain whether an issue of proper termination would be subject to the arbitration provision or not.   In conclusion, based on today's policies (arbitrate everything), I would not think that there would be any reason for us to be concerned with preserving   an argument of limited applicability of the arbitration language found in the PCA Master.I briefly reviewed your draft answer and will fax the comments to you shortly.ThanksElizabeth\n"

PG&amp;E revised the Total Volume to 981,6000 MWh.   Avista didnot respond with an affirmation of the corrected volume.   Our records showthat the original volume of 982,4000 is correct (there was a leap-year day inyear 2000).   The broker confirm and the PG&amp;E revision seem to be both inerror.   Obviously any new confirm that is written between Avista Energy andEnron will have the proper Total Volume for the remaining MWh's.   Since thisAssignment references the original confirmation, our counsel recommendslanguage to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (see email fromBlair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable to PG&amp;E andEnron? Please advise.(2) Avista Energy's original confirmation number 403862 showed a TotalVolume of 14,4000.   PG&amp;E accepted the confirm \"as is.\"   The brokerconfirmation shows total volume correctly as 876,000 MWh's.   Therefore, bothPG&amp;E and AVISTA screwed up.   HOwever, we acknowledge that the total MWh'sshould correctly be as per the broker confirmation.   Again, our counselrecommends language to be inserted under Exhibit B as stated below (seemail from Blair Strong below).   Will this sort of revision be acceptable toPG&amp;E and Enron?   Please advise.To reiterate, we realize that there will be new confirmations between Enronand Avista.   Enron has traditionally written the confirmations (Enron'sconfirm's prevail).   Therefore, the new confirms should be acceptable.   Wewould like to see those confirms in advance if possible.Lastly, time is of the essense.   We are scheduling power already for Januarydeliveries...therefore, we must act quickly on this assignment so as toprevent any problems with scheduling, etc.   I suppose that we could delaythe start dates to February 1st, 20001 if necessary.   Perhaps not a bigissue.Thanks,Nolan SteinerPh: 509-495-81999---Original Message---From: R.

As ECC is preparing its physical power trading documents right now, we need to also prepare a form of GTC and I thought that, since the EEI master was so helpful in my preparation of ECC's form of master, your form of GTC would be helpful as well.   If possible, could you e-mail the document to me?   I am hoping to put our form together next week.CheersGreg\n"

Judge Edgar has been assigned the matter.*The lawsuit concerns the interpretation of an option contract EPMI and TVA entered into on December 6, 19995 (Master Option Purchase Agreement (MOPA).*The sole issue presented by the declaratory judgement is the obligations of TVA and EPMI under the MOPA in the circumstances where EPMI is unable to schedule for delivery, or deliver, energy requested by TVA under the MOPA at the Scheduled Delivery Point (SDP) if the available transfer capability at the SDP is not sufficient to allow the schedule or delivery.   EPMI believes that the MOPA unambiguously addresses the issue.   *A trial date in late June 2000 has been set.*EPMI filed a Motion for Summary Judgement on November 18, 1999.\n"

(In the meantime, however,   I am continuing to work the Appropriations strategy (best possible resolution date October 1, 1999) and the Authorization strategy (best possible resolution date October 7, 2000.)))Currently, the TVA Inspector General George Prosser who can be reached at   (423) 632-4120 is in hot pursuit of Mr. Crowell.   He has successfully had legislation introduced to curb Mr. Crowell's authorities, and soon will issue a report (sure to receive much front page negative publicity) that Mr. Crowell \"lied\" to Congress by failing to disclose a TVA $1000,000 monthly publicity retainer with Hill &amp; Knowlton to a House Congressional Oversight Committee.   Ironically, this retainer was to help Mr. Crowell obtain favourable earned media.We believe   the I.G. could easily be persuaded to pursue the wrong-doing caused by Mr. Crowell in developing TVA policy in the absence of a board.   If he pursues the case, he would likely immediate reinstate our positions during the investigation so as not to cause further harm, plus he could require TVA to pay damages if he successfully proves his case.   Regardless, this investigation would cause nasty publicity for TVA.I have discussed with Joe Hartsoe what materials he may wish to provide the I.G. in order to help him make our case that this action \"created policy.\"   I have also given Joe Hartsoe a listing of all of TVA's industrial customers likely curtailed during the heat wave.   We should contact a few of these industrials in order to also ask them to intervene against TVA's policy action on our control area.   These industrials could also claim monetary damages from being wrongfully curtailed by a policy that arguably reduced the amount of available power in the region.   The down side is Mr. Crowell could pursue \"administrative\" retributions against Enron activities.   \n"

The Canadian Master is based upon EEI but has been \"retyped\" making changes based upon variations in the way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, differences in product and jurisdictional issues.   EEI has called me and stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th   in Ontario to advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the reasons he stated in his email to you.   Do you think I should set up a meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.   At that time, we could also discuss the significant \"policy differences\" to make sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons for the differences.ThanksElizabeth36349\n"

As a result of this shift,   we are not currently looking for additional lawyers for power trading, but if things change I'll let you know.   Just FYI, there may be openings in other areas (finance, asset   development).   If you are interested, let me know and I'll call you back.   Also, I know that power trading lawyers in general are in hot demand   ...   other organizations may be hiring.   I will be up in Portland, next week.

      "body": "\nAttorney-Client Privileged CommunicationNot DiscoverableHi TimLeslie Reeves recently spoke to me about an outstanding receivable we still have relating to PCA.   PCA went into bankruptcy in 19998.   At the time of PCA's bankruptcy, PCA owed   a $5.3 million receivable to EPMI.   On EPMI's books, this uncollected receivable amount was offset by an out-of-the money forward position EPMI had with PCA which we were able to take to zero when PCA defaulted (contract provided for one   way payments upon the occurrence of an event of default) and some funds from credit.   After netting all these amounts,   there is still a $6000,000 receivable showing up as owed from PCA to EPMI.   Based on the current bankruptcy proceedings, it is not likely that EPMI will receive any additional funds from PCA (we have taken a very low key approach in the bankruptcy due to the lack of PCA funds, the extensive amounts owed by PCA to other creditors, the assertions being made by PCA against some of the other creditors, and the legal effect of the one-way payment termination payment that provided us a significant offset to the receivable).Accordingly, unless I hear otherwise from you, I will talk to Leslie and tell her to go ahead and clean up the $6000,000   PCA receivable now, and in the unlikely event PCA makes payments to any creditors,   we would then give such amounts received from PCA back to you. Call me if you have any questions.ThanksElizabeth 713 853 6349\n"

The changes were made to make Article 8 more user friendly and to incorporate the few comments that were agreed   to during the conference call.   I tried blacklining, but that proved not decipherable due to the extensive formatting changes.   Maybe you will have better success.   I have attempted to mark by hand the changes and will fax that to you in case you want to distribute it to the rest of the group.The only changes that were not discussed on the call (other than those resulting from the global restructuring) that I made are as follows:1.   Changed   the Section entitled \"Performance Assurance\" to \"Collateral Threshold\" - Use of PA seemed   misleading since PA is referenced in other sections dealing with collateral.2. Added the words \"acceptable to Party ___\" in new Section 8.1(d) and 8.2(d) in order to clarify, as we did in Sections 8.1 (a) and 8.2(a)   that the security must be acceptable to the receiving party.3. Added provisions in the Cover Sheet to provide expressly whether the options are \"Applicable\" or \"Not Applicable\".As always thanks for your help.Elizabeth 713.853.6349\n"

All bidders must clearly state exceptions to these T&amp;Cs in their offer.   They say any exceptions will affect the value of the offer to Southern.In addition, you should have received last week three summaries regarding interconnection structures with Southern at Caledonia.   That interconnection review you are doing and this review of the T&amp;Cs are necessary for us to bid on the RFP on Feb. 24th.   So if you could get back to me on Feb. 18st, that will give me a few days to formulate a proposal.   Also, depending on what you think the feasibility of an interconnection is, I may not submit a proposal at all since it costs $10,000 to propose.Thanks for your assistance, please do not hesitate to call me with your thoughts - Mike\n"

One option we have considered is the possibility of claiming monetary damages against TVA   for TVA's breach of NERC policies.   In order to make such a statement, we would, in essence, be required to assert that the NERC policies are a \"contract\" which all NERC members are obligated to abide by and for which the failure to do so could result in monetary damages.   One concern with this strategy is whether EPMI and/or its affiliates could possibly be damaged in other, unrelated   proceedings if it was determined that NERC policies were indeed \"contractual obligations\" (e.g., a third party claims monetary damages against EPMI for an alleged violation of NERC \"contractual policies\").It would be very helpful if you would consider this issue and get back to me with any thoughts or comments you have.Thanks for your help.Elizabeth36349CONFIDENTIAL;ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT;NOT DISCOVERABLE\n"

In any current month, the amount of the transmission credit is equal to the then current amount of capital costs paid by Gleason to TVA for the Shleby upgrade, less any transmission credits previously used. I think the way to go is first to see if we can use the credits to offset transmission charges from our other TVA plants (on this point, TVA said no, but since Luke is out of the picture, we should make another run at this). If that does not fly, (that is, if the amount of credits we can use in any month is limited to the transmission charges otherwise due from Gleason on the power it generates), we obviously want to make sure we designate a credit amount equal to only as much as we actually need. Given that I believe we are the first IPP to be in this situation with TVA, and given that TVA is to repay us in 20009 for the actual cost of the Shelby upgrade less transmission credits actually used, we also need to make sure we are accurately tracking both upgrade costs and transmission credits used, and that TVA agrees with what we believe to be the correct balance. Jody Pierce and Amy Copeland are aware of this, but I caution that we need to be extremely careful given the amount of money involved. Toward this end, I have asked Jody and Amy to make sure each TVA Shelby upgrade invoice is adequately labelled as such by TVA before we make payments. I strongly suggest we put in place a similar system for transmission credits whereby we receive TVA signoff as part of the process Dennis To references below.Please follow up with Jody, Amy, and Lloyd to make sure everyone is up to speed on this as we proceed, and please make sure that an adequate process is set up to account for transmission charges, credits, and balance of Shelby upgrade costs.Thanks much,Ben\"To, Dennis P.\" &lt;dpto@tva.gov&lt; on 05/12/2000 02:56:14 PMTo: \"'Larry Soderquist'\" &lt;Larry.Soderquist@enron.com&lt;cc: \"'Jack W.

      "body": "\nLast week, the WSPP drafing group met in sunny California   to continue the slow and steady march towards a standardized, \"national\" agreement. Schedule C , the service schedule for firm transactions, was the primary topic and the following is a summary of where the group is headed.After much discussion, we proposed   that the group consider the definition of firm energy   that Tim, Christian and others have been considering.   The following is proposed language (the base was EPMI's version) that the WSPP group is currently reviewing:Firm Power is power that is sold and scheduled in accordance with applicable reserve requirements for which the only excuse for the failure to deliver or recieve are those set forth in Schedule 3.9 of the WSPP Agreement.   Seller shall take steps necessary for the power to be considered Firm Power under this definition.Schedule 3.9 only allows interruption if (i) within agreed recall time, (ii) due to an Uncontrollable Force or (ii) power is need for native load; provided, however it was agreed that a party would neverless be liable for LDs if it interrupts due to native load requirements (this last point is a major accomplishment that appears to have uniform agreement and will be implemented in the next draft - the group claimed that the \"optics\" are necessary to help traditional utilities).   As a further note, the group agreed to do away with all references to C1 and   C2 and have just one Schedule.Changes from EPMI's proposed definition where   the result of the following discussions:1.   Generated vs. Sold - \"Sold\" was elected over \"generated\" because the group thinks that it is the receiving control area that determines the generator's reserve requirements.2. \"Schedule\"   was added to bolster the scheduling requirements.3.   \"Reserves\" instead of \"Operating Reserves\" was used because the group thought the word operating may be too restrictive.4.   \"WSCC reserve requirements\" was replaced with \"applicable\" reserve requirements because the group thinks that the WSPP Agreement is national in scope and should not be limited to WSPP.5.   References to Non-firm supply as being excluded from Firm Power was excluded because the group thought it was redundent   - no control area would accept a non-firm supply as being firm.6.   Power rather than energy is being used only bacause that is the decision that has already been made.This defintion will be further discussed at   the next meeting on Aug 20th in Denver.   Prior to that time, I would like to get your thoughts on how this is shaping up and what additions/deletions are appropriate.   I look forward to hearing your thoughts.Thanks.Elizabeth 713 853 6349\n"

We have come a long way, however, and only 2 serious issues remain open.   (All the others are at least mostly resolved --- see my 5/1/01 revision w/ marginal notes made during my 5/2/01 meeting w/ them.)   This file is in my office with all the others.XOM requires that all of its contracts contain 2 provisions, both of which are problematic for Enron.(1)   The Federal Contractor Supplement --- exhibit F to the EEI Master --- is designed to assure XOM's compliance w/ the U.S. federal government's requirements imposed on all government contractors.   There are 2 categories of requirements:   environmental laws compliance and small business participation in federal govt purchases of goods and services.   Since XOM has adoped a \"General Commercial Plan\" to comply with such requirements, XOM has promised the U.S. govt that ALL its contracts will contain these provisions.   And that's what the auditors from the U.S. government would be looking to ascertain in a review of XOM's compliance.   As for Enron, we do engage in business w/ the U.S. govt, but we have not adopted a \"General Commercial Plan,\" so we have to address these issues on an ad hoc basis.   Taking the last paragraph of this Supplement as an example (addressing the use of women and minority owned businesses by Enron in supplying services to XOM under this contract), at this point, Enron isn't really prepared to undertake such things and all those I dealt with on this seem a bit nervous about Enron's ability to comply.   I've communicated w/ Michelle Cash, George Wasaff, and Cathy Riley (at Calvin Eakins direction) on this topic, and I asked Cathy Riley to have her director, Calvin Eakins, phone me to discuss this further, but he did not call.   And there does not seem to be a very good solution to this.   XOM has suggested revising the language in Sec. 10.13 (based on my 5/1/01 draft) to add a final sentence \"The Federal Contract Supplement is attached as Exhibit F and each Party shall comply with such requirements to the extent applicable.\"   This certainly takes care of all of XOM's concerns, but I'm not sure this gets Enron all the way where we need to be.   See, for example, Dave Nutt's markup of the environmental provisions (in the file), and Cathy Riley says there are no exceptions or exemptions to the small business requirements.   We might be able to get some outside expertise on this or get Sharon Butcher to help resolve it.(2)   Limitation of Damages --- Article 7 waives consequentials, etc. for both parties.   XOM insists that this provision must carve out damages resulting from the \"gross negligence and/or willful misconduct attributable to its managerial and senior supervisory personnel\".   You can see the full details of the provisions they're looking for in the XOM language in sec 10.4 (same draft), the extensive indemnity language which they added in the last round and which we generally don't mind giving them.   But this impacts Article 7 because the Enron version of the waiver expressly states that the waiver applies to indemnities, and, of course, XOM will not tolerate any exceptions to the liability of each party (yes, it's mutual) for the gross negligence of its managers, etc.   There's a true story behind all this that dates back to the EPA emissions requirements on Reformulated Gasoline (RFG).   Mobil hired a lab to do the testing, the managers of the lab company encouraged the testing staff to \"fudge\" the results, tons of RFG hit the market that was not in compliance, and a huge black mark on Mobil and zillions of dollars lost were the result.   And the contract provided that the lab's damages were limited to the testing fees, and apparently, that worked for the lab company.   So, it's a deal breaker for XOM   b/c they say that if Enron's managers decide to turn off the lights at all the refineries for some specious reason, they need to have proper recourse against Enron.   I'''ve argued with them about this, based on the nature of this contract, the power trading business, etc. but to no avail ...   It would seem that Enron's language in Art. 7, w/ the following rather narrow change, might work for both parties, but it's up to you, now. UNLESS EXPRESSLY HEREIN PROVIDED, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, BY STATUTE, IN TORT OR CONTRACT, UNDER ANY INDEMNITY PROVISION OR OTHERWISE provided, however, that nothing in this Article 7 shall be interpreted to limit either Party's liability under Article 10.4(b).   Let me know if you have any questions about this.   Regards,JaniceEB38111Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp.713-853-1794 (Fax:   713-646-3490)\n"

Directors, officers\ror any other employees associated with\rmarket manipulation of a company would be\rsubject to this bill, the spokesman said.\r Cardoza will introduce the bill at a press\rconference today at 2 p.m. Pacific time. CD\r ___\r   No easy solutions to crisis\r The crisis in California is far beyond short-term\rfixes parading as potential solutions, and\rthere is no turning back for deregulation in the\rstate, according to a report released yesterday\rby consulting firm Andersen.\r California has no choice but to forge ahead in\rrepairing the damage that ill-planned deregulation\rmeasures have caused, the Energy Crisis in the\rWestern U.S.: Lessons for navigating regulatory\rand market minefields report says. \"There=01,s a common\rwisdom that knows you can=01,t unscramble the\regg,\" said Matt Smith, head of Andersen=01,s North\rAmerican energy consulting practice. All that can\rbe done is correct the mistakes, he added.\rIn addition, steps must be implemented to\rprevent the spread of the California \"virus\" to\rother states=01, electricity marketplaces, Smith said.\r \"To begin, in our view, the energy crisis in the\rwestern U.S. has produced formidable challenges\rfor utility industry regulators, state and federal\rpolicymakers, and industry executives,\" Smith said.\r\"The virus spawned in California requires new strategies\rto contain and reverse the damage.\r \"The implications for the development of\rcompetitive energy markets go far beyond the\rwestern United States. Unfortunately, California\rhas taught the nation that regulatory and political\rbarriers can create and sustain an energy crisis.\"\r The proposed solutions put in motion by\rfederal and state regulators, as well as California\rpolicymakers, have only led to an increasingly\runcertain market and tension among those\rworking for a viable resolution, the report says.\r \"In reaction to the breakdown, many of\rCalifornia=01,s political leaders now prefer to abandon\rderegulation,\" the report says.\r The report concludes that power shortages\rand blackouts are inevitable this summer. The\rderegulated marketplace, which took a year to\rthrow off track, will more than likely take a number\rof years to put right, the report says. MCM\r ___\r   Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation\r Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20\rCalifornia Assembly\rhas been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=\r=20\rstate=01,s current\renergy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=\rd=20\rheavily on a\rreport prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=\r=20\rSouthern California\rEdison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.\r But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California --- El Paso Natu=\rral=20\rGas --- is not\rready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=\rt=20\rrecently presented\ras evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.\r As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=\rUC=20\rare pointing\rthe finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=\rr=20\rprices through\raffiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =\rEl=20\rPaso is The Brattle\rGroup=01,s study of the California market.\r Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=\r=20\rof the\rCalifornia Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20\rGroup=01,s market\rstudy proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=\r=20\rcaused by normal\rmarket forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=\r=20\rwhich Assembly\rmembers questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=\r=20\rthe California\rmarket.\r El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=\rt=20\rpresented to\rlegislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=\r=20\rof factors, not a\rconspiracy, caused the price run-up.\r Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=\rso=20\rto conduct\rwork on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20\rconcluded that the\rincreasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=\r=20\rmain culprits in the\rCalifornia gas price imbroglio.\r Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=\r=20\rsaid he\r\"didn=01,t see any smoking gun\" in either report.\r \"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20\rStudy and a little\ron the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20\rlegislature is the best\rplace to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,\" Campbell=20\rsaid. \"I believe FERC\ris looking at this situation \" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=\r=20\rappropriate place.\"\r Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=\r=20\rgive support\rto its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. \"It=01,s being pushed=20\rbasically by the Public\rUtilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion\" by=20\rpipeline companies to\rpush up gas prices in California, he said.\r The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20\rassembly when\rit had failed on the federal level: \"There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=\rt on=20\rnatural gas but on other\rthings here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=\r=20\rfinger elsewhere for\rthe problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=\rg some=20\rof that with the\rpublic utilities commission.\"\r Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20\rprices is a different\rmatter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=\rem=20\rto have taken\ron a life of their own.\r The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=\r=20\rlitigated effort to\rforce FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20\rparticipants. Following\ron a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=\r=20\rThe Brattle Group\rreport, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20\rmajor pipelines that\rserve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.\r Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=\r=20\rrequested data\rcontained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20\rprocess to move\rforward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=\r=20\raccess to evidence\r(GD 4/23).\r Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=\r=20\rcase. The commission\rrecently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=\r=20\rlarge block of\rpipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20\raddressing the California\rAssembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=\re=20\rCalifornia border\rcontroversy obviated the need for more investigation.\r The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=\r=20\rhearing into\rwhether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=\re=20\rup the price of gas\rdelivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=\r=20\rthis summer. (RP000-\r241, et al.) NH\r   \n"

Once through the toll, stay on the right and merge onto the trafficcircle taking first right exit to Route 28 Pine Hill. Take Route 28 all theway to Fleischmanns Exit (about 50 minutes ...You'll go past Olive ,Boiceville , Shandanken, Phoenicia, Pine Hill). Take exit and round bendinto town.Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just beforeit onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to ElkCreek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement onLeft... , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vlycreek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left... White withunstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are twodriveways ... use the second for easy unloading through back.Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat(brunette sister) Dury. (914)254 4360...Eric Rosen (first driveway on left) 254 4643... ... Stan &amp; Adele Seigeldriveway to right... feel absolutely free to call upon them if you feel theneed...

Again please feel free to callthem... She is the one that has the interesting job with the not for profitenvironmental group...Nearby Attractions : Eric Rosens pond...see his garden too... Walk down hisdriveway until you get to trailer ... garden on right... veer off left pastthe trailer into brush and follow path through two fields and see pond onright... Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond ... His new house...(I helped design) is on top of the hill...Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.justwatch for fast traffic... nice views... walk through little abandoned cemeteryacross the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields fornice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back toJohnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through otherpeoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon inthe yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's ... until we go off the road...Wealso left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . ... Go back to Route 28 andtake left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facilitywith life guards and the   \"beach \" looks a little fakey from the road butthe swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock... There are some creekswimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if   you see a bunchof cars along the road chances are that's one...In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a publicswimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts... another goodplace to hang and play frisbee with the kids...Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas... orhike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow thatroad until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking onright... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautifulvista and a not too strenuous hike... You can find these places on the mapsof the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of acabinet in the Living Room ... This is our too busy to put away depository...For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket onthe left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway... it is thecheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on aSat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in awonderful old round barn... See attached maps...Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping... wine store...cheese store and an A&amp;P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place onroute 28 in Arkville... He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster...Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for goodbrowsing...Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel withrestaurant and is very pretty... also has good thrift shop...Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run byrelocated tasteful city folk... good food!!!Things about the house... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in ourpipes in the bathroom... don't be alarmed... just adjust the controls to helpget rid of it... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cookingor drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in thebasement... The Spring is located on the \"high road\" going back towardsFleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is... go over littlebridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 1000 yards until yousee a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on theleft side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the roadacross from the pine stand... It is delicious water... The house water isjust fine for bathing and rinsing food...Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering asthe water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thingif there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it... If itgets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to thepublicshowers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you couldborrow hers...   We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the wholesystem so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact himwhen we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretvillewhere you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing inthe creek while you wait...P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is ontop of the Fridge...Well I think that's the most of it... I'll call you from Block Island withour number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 9111...ourfire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on MainStreet in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergencyroom on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for somereason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help ... she has an excellentrep.Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!!\n"

Take exit and round bendinto town.Look for first and only gas station on right and take right turn just beforeit onto Lake Street. Look at odometer and 4 miles after you'll come to ElkCreek Road. (You'll pass into a different county, see West Settlement onLeft... , Grange Building on right with dairy barn and cows across the street) Take soft turn onto Elk Creek and round bend over small bridge (vlycreek). we are the first house- second driveway - on the left... White withunstained picket fence. The key is for the side door at back. There are twodriveways ... use the second for easy unloading through back.Our neighbors across the street are Barbara (blonde sister) and Pat(brunette sister) Dury.

Good Evening walk to see Great Blue Heron in pond ... His new house...(I helped design) is on top of the hill...Also Walk up Elk creek Rd.justwatch for fast traffic... nice views... walk through little abandoned cemeteryacross the Siegels driveway and walk up that hill and through the fields fornice vistas. Definitely take a bike ride down high road all the way back toJohnson Farm... In general we feel free to access the creeks through otherpeoples property especially if they are not in sight... P.S. the wagon inthe yard is how we get Lucy back to Eric's ... until we go off the road...Wealso left our hiking pack if Sam can be carried in it...Swimming is available at the Pine Hill Lake . ... Go back to Route 28 andtake left go over Pine Hill and see Lake on right.It is a public facilitywith life guards and the   \"beach \" looks a little fakey from the road butthe swimming is reallywonderful with a floating dock... There are some creekswimming holes but we don't really frequent any though if   you see a bunchof cars along the road chances are that's one...In the town of Fleischmanns there is a really nice park with a publicswimming pool, soccer field, tennis courts, basketball courts... another goodplace to hang and play frisbee with the kids...Other day excursions... Little Pond and Big Pond Recreational areas... orhike to Giant Ledge ...see Big Indian turnoff from Route 28 and follow thatroad until you come to the first sharp right bend and see parking onright... Ledge is about 1-1/2 miles... (careful of the edge) a beautifulvista and a not too strenuous hike... You can find these places on the mapsof the Park in the Plastic envelope inside the big cluttered mess of acabinet in the Living Room ... This is our too busy to put away depository...For food shopping you should make a pit stop in Boiceville Supermarket onthe left of Route 28 on the way to the house from the thruway... it is thecheapest best selection and place to stock for the week. If you arrive on aSat. in time to go to the Round barn Farmers Market near Roxbury on Route 30there are fresh produce and food stands and some times live music in awonderful old round barn... See attached maps...Also go to Margaretville once you are at house for shopping... wine store...cheese store and an A&amp;P... For a special meal stop at the seafood place onroute 28 in Arkville... He goes to Maine every week for fresh lobster...Check out the antiques center in the old theater in Margaretville for goodbrowsing...Other towns of interest and beautiful drives... Andes has old hotel withrestaurant and is very pretty... also has good thrift shop...Bovina is a beautiful little town with a good cafe style grocery run byrelocated tasteful city folk... good food!!!Things about the house... Unfortunately we have developed a knocking in ourpipes in the bathroom... don't be alarmed... just adjust the controls to helpget rid of it... Also more importantly we donot use the water for cookingor drinking as it is hard-not so good tasting and has a high salt content-We use the nearby spring to fill the jugs at the foot of the steps in thebasement... The Spring is located on the \"high road\" going back towardsFleischmanns you pass West Settlement where honey stand is... go over littlebridge then see meadow on left go past this meadow about 1000 yards until yousee a stand of tall pine trees on left and there is a wide shoulder on theleft side of the road ... look for the spring on the right side of the roadacross from the pine stand... It is delicious water... The house water isjust fine for bathing and rinsing food...Also make sure the shower curtains stay closed while you are showering asthe water can escape out the back if you don't close them... Another thingif there is alot of rain the water will get a brownish tint to it... If itgets really bad and you don't want to use it to bathe you can go to thepublicshowers at Pine Hill Lake or even ask Barbara across the street if you couldborrow hers...   We have actually gotten an estimate to upgrade the wholesystem so if the guy calls while you are there tell him we will contact himwhen we return... For clothes washing there is a Laundermat in Margaretvillewhere you can play frisbee in the field behind the place or go fishing inthe creek while you wait...P.S. My rod is in the basement and the reel is ontop of the Fridge...Well I think that's the most of it... I'll call you from Block Island withour number there. In the case of Emergency call Eric or Barbara or 9111...ourfire number is posted on the mailbox... Eric Rosen works at the Cafe on MainStreet in Margaretville in the evenings... (there is a hospital emergencyroom on route 28 in Margatretville) If you need to see a doctor for somereason call Karen to get the name of her pediatrician...otherwise Dr. Marguerite Collins may be able to help ... she has an excellentrep.Have Fun and can't wait to see you !!!\n"

Attached I added several suggestions.   Primarily, I suggest adding to the begining paragraph a few words and a sentence to put into perspective what is going on for the quick reader.   Also, on the mention of FERC, I suggested a ( ) to place into context and lighten the sting.   Lastly, when you use \"Commercial\" I suggest using \"commercially reasonable\" if that would be the ultimate standard applied.   Just suggestions --- use as you like.

Overall, I felt we made a lot of progress.   At the end of the call, Pirog said that prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our consideration on a few of the points.   We said that we would be begin to modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and that we could then \"compare notes.\"   He said that CDWR viewed the Enron Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly quickly.Material Regulatory Change Provision.   Pirog said CDWR would be willing to accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability to pay for power.   (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or regulatory generated change).   Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to be characterized as a \"default\" (which should not be a problem from our standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.   (For example, a new CA law that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the CPUC).   Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.   However, he did say that CDWR might entertain a \"no LD walk right\" for EPMI if such a change adversely affected it.   My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying LDs.Early Walk Provision.   He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option.   With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) (our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date.Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 days.   He said all other suppliers have lived with that.   Pirog is sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the \"bond guys\" are already nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the LDs).Suspension of Delivery.   Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other events, such as a bond downgrade.   Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with us on that.Downgrade not a Default.   CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an event of default.   However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having a Downgrade Event a \"no LD walk right\" for EPMI and perhaps an event justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.   In other words, a Downgrade Event would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.   Pirog also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event that no bonds were issued.   That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without LDs.Cross Defaults.   This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not be able to get this is my sense.   However, when asked about the idea of a Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like to discuss that further with CDWR.LD Calculation Methodology.   Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would accept our proposed language.   He said they are striving for consistency among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more \"objective.\"   My sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general.Arbitration.   In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).   Also, holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was made that all three arbitrators be neutral.   I would think that the situs issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political environment if a dispute were to arise.   My general sense, however, is that this is not a \"deal breaker\" for CDWR.Assignment.   In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue as well they are looking   for some consistency.   We were again asked if assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our reaction would be.   Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we said we would look at.   We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult sell in light of the environment.   He did not elaborate on how stringent the assignment standards are in the other deals.New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.   A pass through of some governmental charges was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad.   Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.   He di agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it was fair for us to be protected from that.Legal Opinions.   Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not they would be providing one on the bonds.   Also, he said it was a possibility that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins.   Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that before our walk right expires.Additional CDWR Covenants.   Pirog stated that the additional covenants we have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed internally with CDWR.Pro Rata \"Spread\" Amortization.   Pirog had not reviewed the idea of amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would run it by CDWR.CDWR Information.   Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it plans to give suppliers financial information.   He was resisting our request for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things start to fall into place.Let me know when you wish to follow up.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

I sat down with John Lavorato and Dana Davis this morning to review the deal and get John's approval under the current terms. He has approved the deal in it's current form however, to the extent that we have any material change in the terms I'll need to be sure he's OK with the changes in advance of any binding committment with Central Maine. This is definitely a deal we want to do and given the anticipated acceleration in the negotiations and possible execution, we need to be sure that we're able to react and transact quickly. Dana Davis is obviously on point for all pricing. For all others who have involvement here - please ensure that you're on board with your piece of the deal as is, and available to focus on any negotiated changes that may come up over the next couple of days. Berney Aucoin will be on point for coordinating and managing all internal pricing, approvals, etc., so be sure that Bernie can get ahold of you if he needs to.   Also, for the DASH signatures, why don't you move both Kevin and I to \"Regional Management\" and let Ader and Davis sign for Origination and Trading. Thanks and good luck! ---",

We are currently in the process of negotiating a contract and transaction terms.   They are simultaneously discussing same with other suppliers.   At this point, there are a number of outstanding items (including numerous contract items and credit arrangements).   However, we expect that the pace of the negotiation process will be very quick over the next 1-3 days.   As an example of how quickly things might move, CMP has indicated that the Maine PUC is poised to hold deliberations and approve CMP's signing of a contract within 24 hours of CMP/Enron agreement on contract terms (with updated firm pricing to be supplied just prior to PUC deliberations and held open for about 2-3 hours).Key members of our negotiating team on this deal are as follows:Origination/Marketing:   John Llodra, George WoodLegal:   Janice MooreRegulatory/Governmental:   Daniel AllegrettiCommodity Structuring:   Jim Meyn, Zach SampsonCredit:   Edward Sacks, Tracy NgoAttached below is a draft of the DASH for this prospective deal.   Items subject to change or still under negotiation are noted.   While this DASH is prepared assuming we obtain a multi-year extension swaption, there is a chance it may end up being a single year deal for the period Mar 1, 01- Feb 28, 02.   My intent in sending the DASH at this time is to familiarize you all with the aspects of the deal at this point in time, to enable us to move quickly to get internal approvals in the event we reach final agreement with CMP over the next couple of days.   Once agreement is reached with CMP on outstanding items, a revised DASH will be circulated.   Please feel free to call me at 978-4449-99936, or Jim Meyn/Berney Aucoin in structuring (5-32223, 3-4784) if you have any questions on the commercial structure or valuation to date.   Thanks.RegardsJohn\n"

We tried to come up with as many arguments as possible, recognizing the strong commercial desire to put in the second interconnect.   As we have discussed, certain language in the Interconnect Agreement is troublesome, generally due to the fact that it does not appear that a second interconnect was contemplated at the time the project was initially developed.   Nonetheless, we believe that Caledonia does have a number of arguments in favor of the position that it should be able to build the second interconnect without a contractual block.   The strength of some of these arguments will turn in large part on further factual development with the commercial group, as noted in a number of places in the memo.Please let me know when you wish to follow up.   And, as I noted in my conversation with Elizabeth this morning, there is a possibility I may be in Houston next week and perhaps we could meet with the commercial folks at that time.   I think it would be advisable to walk through the various possible scenarios/strategies with them so that we have the benefit of the TVA \"history\" and likely responses of TVA to some of the arguments noted in the memo.Thanks   John - 6Z3601!.doc\n"

I also plan to add:   the model tariff and service agreement, slides concerning the EEI contract development process, a page showing the location of the eei contract website, and list of upcoming activities.   Please let me know if there is anything else you think should be added as a handout (preferably something that does not need to be created from scratch).Patty, in addition to the attached slides, Bob Viola said he was comfortable with using John Varholy's presentation, but wants to discuss further.   I've asked Marvin Goldstein if he intends to use his forward contract and bankruptcy memo for his presentation.   Its attached.   Shari Stack said she will finish up her presentation and send it to you   today.   Contact info for your panels:   Bob Viola 617-912-6256 (rviola@edisonmission.com); Marvin Goldstein 212-806-5629 (mgoldstein@stoock.com); Mike Small 202-393-12000 (small@wrightlaw.com); and Shari Stack 713-207-52333 (shari_stack@reliantenergy.com) .   If you need Marvin's hotel number I can try and get it, he's on vacation this week.   He did not return a message I left yesterday.   David has a conference call scheduled for Friday for his panels and hopefully, you can set one up for yours this week.Looking forward to speaking w/ you this week.Andrew S.

The panel moderators should have a conference call with their panels either Thursday or Friday this week to discuss the timing and assignments I put in the schedule.   I'd be happy to participate with you.Materials.   For most of the contract-specific panels, I think we should use an updated version of the slides we used in November.   I am attaching the original slides and updated versions I've used subsequently.   Please make any changes you feel are needed and FAX them to me by noon Eastern tommorow.   I am also attaching Fritz' flowchart (into product 2.ppt) of the Into Product A and Liz' hypotheticals (examples.ppt).   Liz or Fritz, in light of the latest changes to the Into product, do these need to change?Anyone with separate presentations they want distributed at the workshop has two options:   they can email them no later than cob Thursday or, if you can't make that deadline, make arrangements to have 1110 copies delivered to the conference hotel on Monday March 6.   Stapled, 3 hole punched, double sided copies would be preferable.AV -   we will have a laptop, LCD, overhead and slide projector available.Any speaker who can make it for 7 o'clock dinner at Molina's on Westheimer is welcome as EEI's guest.   Houston-based speakers are welcome to invite their colleagues to the reception.Please contact me if you have any questionsAndrew S.

Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.   Entergy is sinking in Cinergy.Seller must move to another interface (either on   Cinergy's border (NIPSCO, LG&amp;E, AEP. . .) or in Cinergy's control area (Wabash) at which Buyer can receive energy such that energy can sink in Cinergy.   Seller can require Buyer to purchase Non-Firm transmission (or Firm, if available) but each party will be responsible for any additional transmission costs incurred to reschedule to another delivery point.Ex #23. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and receives response that Firm is available.   Buyer purchases Non-Firm instead.   Entergy is sinking in Cinergy.Ex #333. Buyer puts in request for Firm transmission from Cinergy within 30 minutes of Seller's notification and request is accepted and purchased by Buyer.   Buyer also secures Firm transmission from LG&amp;E to sink energy in LG&amp;E.There are references to specific sections in the product definition, I don't know if they are still valid in light of the latest changes.Could someone help me out before 4pm Eastern?

Please note that we recommend that these form letters be used merely as guides as the contracts that Enron has entered into with the PG&amp;E entities all provide for varying procedures for termination.   Therefore, each contract should be referenced prior to sending out a termination letter.Additionally, Jim Huemoeller and I believe that it would be best that one person be responsible for preparing the various terminations, or in the alternative, have such person review each termination letter so that there is consistent wording and so that the Enron and LeBoeuf persons responsible for monitoring the PG&amp;E situation are certain which contracts are being terminated.Please let us know if you have any questions, or if we can be of further assistance.Best regards,Christina L.C.

I believe that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5.   The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and greatest EPMI trading form (although I am reasonably comfortable that the cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).   There have been numerous discussions about this form being revised.   By carbon copy of this email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon.Stuart\n"

If you can add your comments today, lets meet first thing tommorrow to discuss (leave me a message tonight and I will come in early to read before we meet).
