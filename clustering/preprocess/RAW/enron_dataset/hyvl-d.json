      "body": "\nTexas City Facility - The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be strained.   Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron and Dominion Resources in early 19998.   Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the facility.   After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were terminated.   At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in volumes.   Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts invoiced were correct.   Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of   creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.   These notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force majeure.   When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking valves, etc.Clear Lake Facility - The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to deliveries at this facility.   This may be because the contract covering the base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was negotiated by ENA in 19995.   Midcon remains connected to the facility and delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.   Market priced gas is required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes supplied under the 19995 agreement.   Should the power purchase agreement be amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery points.   Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S pipeline.   It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not.   \n"

When I   was a child in the1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a   mature figure was designedfor a woman with a mature, figure   - boned, trussed and reinforced, notso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift andthey did a good job.Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent   girl with afigure carved from a potato chip.   The mature   woman has a choice - shecan either front up at the   maternity department and try on a floralsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escapedfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-milldepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what   amounts toa designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.What choice did I have?   I wandered around, made my   sensible choice andentered the chamber of horrors known as the   fitting room.   The firstthing I noticed was the extraordinary   tensile strength of the stretchmaterial.The   Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA tolaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus thatif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protectedfrom shark attacks.   The reason for this is   that any shark taking aswipe at your passing midriff would   immediately suffer whiplash.I fought my way into the   bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulderstrap in place, I   gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.   It took awhile to   find the other.At last I located it   flattened beside my seventh rib.   The problem isthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.   The mature woman is meantto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed   hump.I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the   mirror to take a fullview assessment.   The bathing suit fit   all right, but unfortunately, itonly fit those bits of me   willing to stay inside it.   The rest of meoozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.   I looked like alump of   play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, thepre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There youare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't sosure and asked what else she had to show me.I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump   ofmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance   of anoversized napkin in a serviette ring.   I struggled into   a pair ofleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came   out looking likeTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a   rough day.I tried on a black number with a midriff   and looked like a jellyfish inmourning.   I tried on a bright   pink pair with such a high cut leg Ithought I would have to wax my   eyebrows to wear them.Finally, I found a suit that   fit...a two piece affair with shorts stylebottom and a loose   blouse-type top.   It was cheap, comfortable, andbulge   friendly, so I bought it.When I got home, I read the   label which said \"Material may becometransparent in water.\" I'm   determined to wear it anyway...I'll justhave to stay out of   the water!\n"

LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!THIS IS A TRUE STORYA little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you don't know already is a veryexpensive store i.e. they sell your typical $8.000 t-shirt for $50.000.Lets let them have it!!!My daughter and I had just finished a saladat a Neiman-Marcus Cafe in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because both of us are such cookie lovers, we decided to try the \"Neiman-MarcusCookie.\" It was so excellent that I asked if they would give me the recipe and the waitress said with asmall frown, \"I'm afraid not but, you can buy the recipe.\" Well, I asked how much, and she responded,\"Only two fifty, it's a great deal!\" I agreed with approval, just add it to my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was $285.000. I looked again and I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.000 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.000\" That was outrageous!I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it was \"two-fifty,\" which clearly does not mean \"twohundred and fifty dollars\"by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because according to them, \"What the waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point.\" I explained to her the criminal statues which govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.I was basically told,\"Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding your money.\" I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get any of my money back. I just said, \"Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have $250.000 worth of fun.\" I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover inthe United States with an e-mail account has a $250.000 cookie recipe from Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, \"I wish you wouldn't do this.\" Isaid, \"Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off,\" and slammed down the phone on her.So here it is!!!

Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gasmanagement system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section fromthe Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feedthe Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being theChicago, Illinois information.   So, I politely told the Accountant that theinfo in the gas management system was correct as entered.   He (theAccountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go toEnovate c/o Enron at 14000 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 7770002.   Do youhave any objection to changing this in the contract?   Please advise, we'dlike to do what would best streamline this process.Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everythingwill run smoothly.

Lunch&lt; was half an hour.&lt;   &lt; Lunchtime&lt;   &lt; was his prayer time, for finding strength and&lt; power.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; \"I stay only moments, see, because the factory is&lt; so far away; as I kneel&lt;   &lt; here talking to the Lord, this is kinda what I&lt; say:&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; \"I JUST CAME AGAIN TO TELL YOU, LORD, HOW HAPPY&lt; I'VE BEEN, SINCE WE FOUND&lt;   &lt; EACH OTHER'S FRIENDSHIP AND YOU TOOK AWAY MY SIN.&lt; DON'T KNOW MUCH OF HOW&lt;   &lt; TO&lt;   &lt; PRAY, BUT I THINK ABOUT YOU EVERYDAY. SO, JESUS,&lt; THIS IS JIM CHECKING IN&lt;   &lt; TODAY.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; The minister feeling foolish, told Jim, that was&lt; fine. He told the man he&lt;   &lt; was&lt;   &lt; welcome to come and pray just anytime.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; Time to go, Jim smiled, said \"Thanks.\" He hurried&lt; to the door. The&lt;   &lt; minister&lt;   &lt; knelt at the altar, he'd never done it before.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; His cold heart melted, warmed with love, and met&lt; with Jesus there. As the&lt;   &lt; tears flowed, in his heart, he repeated old Jim's&lt; prayer:&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; \"I JUST CAME AGAIN TO TELL YOU, LORD, HOW HAPPY&lt; I'VE BEEN, SINCE WE FOUND&lt;   &lt; EACH OTHER'S FRIENDSHIP AND YOU TOOK AWAY MY SIN.&lt; I DON'T KNOW MUCH OF HOW&lt;   &lt; TO&lt;   &lt; PRAY, BUT I THINK ABOUT YOU EVERYDAY. SO, JESUS,&lt; THIS IS ME CHECKING IN&lt;   &lt; TODAY.\"&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; Past noon one day, the minister noticed that old&lt; Jim hadn't come. As more&lt;   &lt; days passed without Jim, he began to worry some.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; At the factory, he asked about him, learning he&lt; was ill. The hospital&lt;   &lt; staff&lt;   &lt; was worried, but he'd given them a thrill.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; The week that Jim was with them, brought changes&lt; in the ward. His smiles,&lt;   &lt; a&lt;   &lt; joy contagious. Changed people, were his reward.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; The head nurse couldn't understand why Jim was so&lt; glad, when no flowers,&lt;   &lt; calls or cards came, not a visitor he had.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; The minister stayed by his bed, he voiced the&lt; nurse's concern: No friends&lt;   &lt; came to show they cared. He had nowhere to turn.&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; Looking surprised, old Jim spoke up and with a&lt; winsome smile; \"the nurse&lt;   &lt; is&lt;   &lt; wrong, she couldn't know, that in here all the&lt; while everyday at noon He's&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; here, a dear friend of mine, you see, He sits&lt; right down, takes my hand,&lt;   &lt; leans over and says to me:&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; \"I JUST CAME AGAIN TO TELL YOU, JIM, HOW HAPPY I&lt; HAVE BEEN, SINCE WE FOUND&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; THIS FRIENDSHIP, AND I TOOK AWAY YOUR SIN. ALWAYS&lt; LOVE TO HEAR YOU PRAY, I&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; THINK ABOUT YOU EACH DAY, AND SO JIM, THIS IS&lt; JESUS CHECKING IN TODAY.\"&lt;   &lt;&lt;   &lt; If this blesses you, pass it on...

Coors put its slogan, \"Turn it loose,\" into Spanish, where it&lt; was read as \"Suffer from diarrhea.\"&lt;&lt; 2. Scandinavian vacuum manufacturer Electrolux used the following in an&lt; American campaign: \"Nothing sucks like an Electrolux.\"&lt;&lt; 3. Clairol introduced the \"Mist Stick\", a curling iron, into&lt; German only to find out that \"mist\" is slang for manure. Not too&lt; many people had use for the \"manure stick.\"&lt;&lt; 4. When Gerber started selling baby food in Africa, they used the same&lt; packaging as in the U.S., with the beautiful Caucasian baby&lt; on the label. Later they learned that in Africa, companies&lt; routinely put pictures on the label of what's inside, since most&lt; people can't read.&lt;&lt; 5. Colgate introduced a toothpaste in France called Cue, the name of a&lt; notorious porno magazine.&lt;&lt; 6. An American T-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the&lt; Spanish market which promoted the Pope's visit. Instead of \"I saw the&lt; Pope\" (el Papa), the shirts read \"I saw the potato\" (la&lt; papa).&lt;&lt; 7. Pepsi's \"Come alive with the Pepsi Generation\" translated into \"Pepsi&lt; brings your ancestors back from the grave\", in Chinese.&lt;&lt; 8. Frank Perdue's chicken slogan, \"it takes a strong man to make&lt; a tender chicken\" was translated into Spanish as \"it takes an&lt; aroused man to make a chicken affectionate.\"&lt;&lt; 9. The Coca-Cola name in China was first read as \"Ke-kou-ke-la\",&lt; meaning \"Bite the wax tadpole\" or \"female horse stuffed with&lt; wax,\" depending on the dialect. Coke then researched 40,000&lt; characters to find a phonetic equivalent \"ko-kou-ko-le\",&lt; translating into \"happiness in the mouth.\"&lt;&lt; 10. When Parker Pen marketed a ball-point pen in Mexico, its ads&lt; were supposed to have read, \"it won't leak in your pocket and&lt; embarrass you\". Instead, the company thought that the word&lt; \"embarazar\" (to impregnate) meant to embarrass, so the ad read:&lt; \"It won't leak in your pocket and make you pregnant.\"&lt;\n"

Is this\r true?\r   A:   Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything\r   wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live\r longer;\r   that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it\r   faster.   Want to live longer? Take a nap.\r   Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?\r   A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and\r   corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an\r   efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?\r   Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy\r   vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 1000% of your recommended daily\r   allowance of vegetable slop.\r   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?\r   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we\r   all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories=\r:\r   animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not\r   animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only\r   leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy\r your\r   liquid vegetables.\r   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?\r   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to\r   one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.\r   Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to \"spot\" for him while he did the bench\r   press. What did he mean?\r   A: \"Spotting\" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up\r   your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=\rd\r   that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t=\ro\r   reevaluate your exercise program.\r   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=\re\r   program?\r   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.   My philosophy is: No Pain-No\r Pain.\r   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?\r   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If\r   you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.\r   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?\r   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In\r   fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be\r bad for\r   you?\r   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?\r   A: Thicker gravy.\r   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the\r   middle?\r   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=\rd\r   only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.\r   I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.\r =7F\r&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\rShawn Shafai\rIT Project Manager, Global Extranet Management\rCisco Systems, Inc.\rTel:   408-525-49996\rFax:   408-526-7373\rPager: 8000-365-4578\rmailto:sshafai@cisco.com &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\r   &lt;&lt;   Empowering the Internet Generation   &lt;&lt;\r   Are You Ready?\r\n"

One was gay and the other a drunk. Shethought&lt; long and hard about it, and when no one else applied, she decided tohire&lt; the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the housethan&lt; the drunk.&lt;&lt; He turned out to be fantastic worker, worked long hard hours every dayand&lt; knew a lot about ranching. For weeks the two of them worked, and theranch&lt; was doing really well. Then one day the rancher's wife said to thehired&lt; hand, \"You have done a really good job and the ranch looks great, you&lt; should go into town and kick up your heels.\"&lt;&lt; The hired hand agreed readily, and Saturday night went to town.However:&lt; One o'clock came and he didn't return.&lt; Two o'clock and still no hired hand&lt; Two-thirty, finally, in came the hired hand.&lt;&lt; The rancher's wife was sitting by the fireplace and quietly called himover&lt; to her.&lt; \"Unbutton my blouse and take it off,\" she said. Trembling, he did asshe&lt; asked.&lt; \"Now take off my boots.\" He did so, slowly. \"Now take off my socks.\" He did.&lt; \"Now take off my skirt.\" He did. \"Now take off my bra.\" Again with trembling hands he did as she asked. \"Now,\" she said, \"take off my panties.\" He slowly pulled them down. Then she looked at him and said, \"Don't youever&lt; wear my clothes to town again!\n"

      "body": "\nDon't know if this is true but it's still funny!Subject: Stupid is as Stupid Does&lt; This could be possibly the funniest story in a long while. This is a&lt; bricklayer's accident report, which was printed in the newsletter of the&lt; Australian equivalent of the Workers' Compensation board. This is a true&lt; story. Had this guy died, he'd have received a Darwin Award for sure...&lt;&lt;   Dear Sir&lt;&lt;   \"I am writing in response to your request for additional information in&lt; Block 3 of the accident report form. I put \"poor planning\" as the cause of&lt; my accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following&lt; details will be sufficient.&lt;&lt;   I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was workingalone&lt; on the roof of a new six-story building. When I completed my work, I found&lt; that I had some bricks left over which, when weighed later were found tobe&lt; slightly in excess of 5000 lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand,I&lt; decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to&lt; the side of the building on the sixth floor.&lt;&lt;   Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung thebarrel&lt; out and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope,&lt; holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks. You will notein&lt; Block 111 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs.&lt;&lt;   Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my&lt; presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I&lt; proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building. In the vicinity of&lt; the third floor, I met the barrel, which was now proceeding downward at an&lt; equal, impressive speed. This explained the fractured skull, minor&lt; abrasions and the broken collar bone, as listed in section 3 of theaccident&lt; report form.&lt;&lt;   Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the&lt; fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.&lt; Fortunately by this time I had regained my presence of mind and was ableto&lt; hold tightly to the rope, in spite of beginning to experience a great deal&lt; of pain.&lt;&lt;   At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the&lt; ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of&lt; the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs. I refer you again to&lt; my weight. As you can imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side ofthe&lt; building. In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up.&lt; This accounts for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and several&lt; lacerations of my legs and lower body.&lt;&lt;   Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrelseemed&lt; to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile ofbricks&lt; and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked. I am sorry to report,&lt; however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I&lt; again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I&lt; lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.&lt; This explains the two broken legs.&lt;&lt;   I hope this answers your inquiry.\"&lt; Tony C.&lt;&lt;\n"

As we discussed this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement utilized by these counterparties.   Although I have no authority to approve them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, I would approve them for execution.   Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get out of balance.   If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services.   No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star Pipeline.   The only documents faxed were two transportation services request forms.   \n"

As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day long.   You will work all day under the sun!   I will give you a life span of 50 years.\"The cow objected, \"What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you.\"   So God agreed.On the second day, God created the dog.   God said to the dog, \"What you are supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.   Any people that come in, you will have to bark at them!   I'll give a life span of 20 years.\"The dog objected, \"What?   All day long to sit by the door? No way!   I give you back my other 10 years of life!\"   So God agreed.On the third day, God created the monkey.   He said to the monkey, \"Monkeys have to entertain people.   You've got to make them laugh and do monkey tricks.   I'll give you 20 years life span.\"The monkey objected. \"What?   Make them laugh?   Do monkey faces and tricks?   Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back.\"   So God agreed.On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, \"Your job is to sleep, eat, and play.   You will enjoy very much in your life.   All you need to do is to enjoy and do nothing.   This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life span.\"The man objected.   \"What?   Such a good life!   Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?   Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?   No way, man!...Why don't we make a deal?   Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will take them from you!   That makes my life span 70 years, right?\"   So God agreed.AND THAT'S WHY...In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing much.   For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support the family.   For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making monkey faces and monkey tricks.   And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, sit by the front door and bark at people! \n"

Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of compensation which I understand you are working into a document.   He has also assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation plans.   Can you confirm this?   Enron has indicated that since I am over 555, I will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.   They indicated that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.   I can see no benefit in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.   Isn't this the case? Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for a career opportunity with HPL.\n"

Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.   Five years is the general ceiling.   We need to be careful   PEAK understands that if the surety elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger an automatic demand against the bond.   PEAK should already know the issues involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) last fall.   This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.Call me with your comments.   Thanks.Philip N.

I have not attempted to redraft the language, only to point out areas where we will need to work on modifications to the Contract language.1. Section 5.01 Provision needs to be changed so that Termination Payment is first paid by Company to Customer and if not paid by Company after notice, then the Customer would be entitled to make a draw under the Surety Bond.2. Section 5.03   Provision needs to be changed to reflect that the initial bond term shall be ___5___ years.   At the end of the initial term, the Company shall either replace the bond with a new bond for remaining   term of prepayment, provide a letter of credit for the remaining amount of prepayment, or provide a corporate guaranty.   3. Section 7.01 This provision should be okay under the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 enacted as of December 14, 2000.   The Customer needs to represent to the Company that the Customer is an \"eligible contract participant\" under the Act.4. Section 10.02 10.02.05 - Company has no control on the substance of the opinion of counsel for the surety bond provider.   The substance of such opinion should be as negotiated between the bond providers counsel and the Customer.   10.02.06   Should Customers inablility to get funding be an out for the Customer?   10.02.08   Likewise, should the Customer's inability to complete any swap agreements be an out for the Customer?5. Section 21.01 21.01.02   Company should get aleast 5 business days notice of nonpayment before the Customer should be entitled to cause an Early Termination Date.   21.01.03   As previously noted in 5.03, Company should have the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the Term Sheet.   Contract and Term Sheet need to be made consistent.6. Section 21.03 and 21.04   Provisions of the Contract need to be consistent so that all obligations of the parties are netted before any payment is made.   Also 21.03 should first provide for payment by the Company and if not made, then by the surety or other security provider.   We shouldn't have to pay the Termination Payment to the Customer and then invoice the Customer for any Market Exposure Damages under section 21.06.   These should be netted or aggregated in computing the Termination Payment.\n"

      "body": "\nGrant, I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do not require explanation or clarification.   Those changes are reflected in the above document.   Let me go over your list of items: 1. I have deleted the word \"DRAFT\". 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 20001 when the contract would be executed by the City. 3. I have changed the word \"may\" to \"shall\". 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a particular point.   I do not think their is an omission. 5. I have added the word \"reasonable\". 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.   At the point that a Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be necessary to attain closure. 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,   neither party should be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's obligations under the Contract.   We might be able to add language to extend the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure. 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.   During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.   Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any month.   9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate rating applies to ENA. 10. I have changed \"a\" to \"the\" 111. I have eliminated the   60 day limitation on the duration of an event of Force Majeure. 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a particular party may have caused.   I think the language is clear as written. 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were referenced.   I am still waiting for your language.   I started filling it in using language that had been provided by the City. 14. I added the word \"reasonable\". 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAP. 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% over prime language. 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs to be discussed with that group.   BB-   is considered investment grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BB.   ENA is not a rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating. 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have made.   If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know that before we execute the Contract. 19. I have added the word \"reasonable\". 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.   21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.   We can agree to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.   I am willing to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer. 222. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.   Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.   We believe that each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the Contract.   I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you care to discuss any of these matters.\t\"Kolling, Grant\" &lt;grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us&lt;\t03/02/20001 03:43 PM \t\t\t To: \"'Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com'\" &lt;Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com&lt;, \"Kolling, Grant\" &lt;grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us&lt;\t\t\t cc: Kim.Ward@enron.com\t\t\t Subject: RE: Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement &lt;&lt;000719888 RESO Enron.doc&lt;&lt;Dan:First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the CityManager to execute the Enfolio agreement.More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management hasreviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additionalchanges to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questionsabout certain of its terms and conditions.Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of theexhibits.1.   There is the word \"DRAFT\" above the title of the Enfolio agreement whichshould be deleted.2.   The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words \"1st ofJanuary, 20001.\"   It should be left blank, until the parties have signed thecontract.   Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs thecontract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer theto-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.3.   Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.   The City (Customer) wants Enron(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.Therefore, the City requests the word \"may\" should be changed to \"shall.\"4.   Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's RequestedQuantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.   Seller's failure to Schedule theBuyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller'sDeficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include aMaximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?   What is the reason for the omission?5.   Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:   Line 23 refers to \"reasonableattorneys' fees\" yet line 15 refers to \"attorneys' fees.\"   To be internallyconsistent, line 15 should say \"reasonable attorneys' fees.\"6.   Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.   A statement showing thedetermination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.   It's unclearwhether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determinationbefore a dispute is referred to arbitration.   The City should be entitled toreceive a copy of the determination and to question it before it isobligated to pay the Termination Payment.   Please clarify, or permit theCity to exercise these rights.7.   Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if abankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.   Is this (underbankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seekdismissal of a bankruptcy petition?   Please refer to the 111 USC section thatbacks up this provision, or change to 60 days.8.   Section 4.2(v) and (vi):   Please change \"30 days\" to \"5 days.\"   The Cityis concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail toSchedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.9.   Section 4.2(ix):   this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?Please explain.10. Section 4.5, line 4:   Is \"a Company\" supposed to refer to \"the Company\"?111. Article 5.   The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provisionas drafted.   It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the60-day period stated therein.   There is no such limitation under Californialaw in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.12.   Article 7, Section 7.2:   Could Enron translate the last sentence?   Wedon't understand it.13.   Appendix \"1\":   Act:   Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?14.   Appendix \"1\", Claims, line 4:   Please add \"reasonable\" before\"attorneys' fees. 15.   Appendix \"1\", GAAP:   This should read: \"GAAP means generally acceptedaccounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, andgovernmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,with respect to Customer.\"16.   Appendix \"1\", Interest Rate:   Please delete \"two percent over\".   TheCity has a AA bond rating, therefore, the   City believes the 2% over primeshould not apply to it.17.   Appendix \"1\", Material Adverse Change:   What does Enron believe theCity's Net Worth to be?   The $4000 million threshold is mentioned.   Also,what is ENA's bond rating?   Is \"BB-\" an investment grade rating?18.   Representations and Warranties:   Because we have agreed that theopinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are beingdeleted.   But the \"Representations and Warranties\" is nevertheless includedin the agreement.   Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has notundertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue anopinion.   We would like to delete \"and (vii) it is not ... Party.\"19.   Operational Flow Orders, line 8:   Please add \"reasonable\" before\"attorneys' fees.\"20.   Financial Matters, line 8:   What is meant by \"to the extent it has alegal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.\"21.   Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.   We do not as a matter of legalpolicy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.   Is Enronamenable to mediation?   This process is less formal and less costly in myopinion.222.   Authority for Transactions.   Staff would like the Agreement to includea list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade onbehalf of their employers.   Could a statement be added to this section tothis effect?   Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.Thank you so much for considering these issues.   There are others which Ihope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you forresponse.Look forward to hearing from you soon.

Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -   \"20 or more Gas Days\" is acceptable. 13. I will change the definition of \"Act\" as you suggest. 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.   Is this an acceptable resolution? 222. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into transactions under the contract.   Our position is that whoever answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.   However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.   Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact list.   Will an initial contact list be acceptable?   Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.

I was out of townagain, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.   Let me follow up with a coupleof additional inquiries.7.   Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.8.   Re 4.2(v) and (vi).   How about 20 days?13. Definition of \"Act.\"   I suggest you refer to Article 111, sections 5 and9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.   Section 3 is notregularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, thoughI can see how the language could lead   one to cite it.21.   In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if Ihave understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I'veparticipated.   Mediation is non-binding.   As a practical matter, it can costalmost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,but the \"rules of engagement\" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.We avoid the rigid procedures.   I believe Enron should consider thisapproach at times.   Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend tomy client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes aproposal that's acceptable to the parties.   The cost of arbitration is notworth it.   That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation toarbitration.222.   I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved toengage in authorized transactions.   We can do the same.   We've had anunfavorable experience with another Texas-basedenergy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.   Wedon't want to litigate the issue of due authority.   That list would helpIt's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of thecontract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.   There are aton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.Thanks.   Grant.   ---Original Message---   From: Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com [mailto:Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com]   Sent: Thursday, March 08, 20001 3:13 PM   To: grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us   Cc: Kim.Ward@enron.com   Subject: RE: Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/SaleAgreement   &lt;&lt; File: 20001-0002ctr.doc &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; File: 000719888 RESO Enron.doc&lt;&lt;   (See attached file: 20001-0002ctr.doc)   Grant,   I have reviewed your requested changes and have madethe changes which   do not require explanation or clarification.

We have found that personnel of both our Companyand that of our   Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workableand merely   allows a party to back out of transactions it does not likeon the basis   that the person who agreed to such transaction was not onthe list.   Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties whocan transact.   We believe that each party should be responsible for theactions of its   employees and should stand behind any transactions thatthose parties may   enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of theContract.   I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be inall next week if   you care to discuss any of these matters.   \"Kolling, Grant\"   &lt;grant_kolling@city.palo-a   To:\"'Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com'\"   lto.ca.us&lt;&lt;Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com&lt;, \"Kolling, Grant\"&lt;grant_kolling@city.palo-alto.ca.us&lt;   03/02/20001 03:43 PM   cc:Kim.Ward@enron.comSubject:   RE: Enfolio Master FirmPurchase/Sale Agreement   &lt;&lt;000719888 RESO Enron.doc&lt;&lt;   Dan:   First, I've attached the proposed resolution whichauthorizes the City   Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.   More importantly, I need to inform you that our seniormanagement has   reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked topresent additional   changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and toraise questions   about certain of its terms and conditions.   Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to theend of the   exhibits.   1.   There is the word \"DRAFT\" above the title of the Enfolioagreement   which   should be deleted.   2.   The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not containthe words \"1st   of   January, 20001.\"   It should be left blank, until the partieshave signed the   contract.   Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of thedate it signs   the   contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the Cityto proffer the   to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.   3.   Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.   The City (Customer)wants Enron   (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,as defined.   Therefore, the City requests the word \"may\" should bechanged to \"shall.\"   4.   Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:Buyer's Requested   Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.   Seller's failure toSchedule the   Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller'sDeficiency Default.   How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into aSeller's   Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity doesnot include a   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?   What is the reasonfor the   omission?   5.   Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:   Line 23 refersto \"reasonable   attorneys' fees\" yet line 15 refers to \"attorneys' fees.\"To be internally   consistent, line 15 should say \"reasonable attorneys' fees.\"   6.   Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.   A statementshowing the   determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.It's unclear   whether the City is entitled to review and challenge thedetermination   before a dispute is referred to arbitration.   The Cityshould be entitled   to   receive a copy of the determination and to question itbefore it is   obligated to pay the Termination Payment.   Please clarify,or permit the   City to exercise these rights.   7.   Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event willexist if a   bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.   Is this(under   bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which onemay seek   dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?   Please refer to the 111USC section   that   backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.   8.   Section 4.2(v) and (vi):   Please change \"30 days\" to \"5days.\"   The   City   is concerned with the number of days that Enron may bepermitted to fail to   Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.   9.   Section 4.2(ix):   this language discusses a default byEnron Corp.   (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default inthis regard?   Please explain.   10. Section 4.5, line 4:   Is \"a Company\" supposed to referto \"the Company\"   ?   111. Article 5.   The City is uncomfortable with the forcemajeure provision   as drafted.   It states that the parties must perform even ifa FM event   (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties fromperforming with the   60-day period stated therein.   There is no such limitationunder California   law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.   12.   Article 7, Section 7.2:   Could Enron translate the lastsentence?   We   don't understand it.   13.   Appendix \"1\":   Act:   Please explain why Section 3 isreferred to?   14.   Appendix \"1\", Claims, line 4:   Please add \"reasonable\"before   \"attorneys' fees.   15.   Appendix \"1\", GAAP:   This should read: \"GAAP meansgenerally accepted   accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect toCompany, and   governmental generally accepted accounting principles,consistently   applied,   with respect to Customer.\"   16.   Appendix \"1\", Interest Rate:   Please delete \"twopercent over\".   The   City has a AA bond rating, therefore, the   City believesthe 2% over prime   should not apply to it.   17.   Appendix \"1\", Material Adverse Change:   What does Enronbelieve the   City's Net Worth to be?   The $4000 million threshold ismentioned.   Also,   what is ENA's bond rating?   Is \"BB-\" an investment graderating?   18.   Representations and Warranties:   Because we have agreedthat the   opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps andwarranties are being   deleted.   But the \"Representations and Warranties\" isnevertheless included   in the agreement.   Item (i) should be deleted, because theCity has not   undertaken a court search as is our custom and practicewhenever we issue   an   opinion.   We would like to delete \"and (vii) it is not ...Party.\"   19.   Operational Flow Orders, line 8:   Please add\"reasonable\" before   \"attorneys' fees.\"   20.   Financial Matters, line 8:   What is meant by \"to theextent it has a   legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc.\"   21.   Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.   We do not as amatter of   legal   policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.Is Enron   amenable to mediation?   This process is less formal and lesscostly in my   opinion.   222.   Authority for Transactions.   Staff would like theAgreement to include   a list of employees for Company and Customer who areauthorized to trade on   behalf of their employers.   Could a statement be added tothis section to   this effect?   Then, we could attach the list(s) as anExhibit C.   Thank you so much for considering these issues.   There areothers which I   hope to receive from staff next week and which I willforward to you for   response.   Look forward to hearing from you soon.   I will be out oftown after today   until Wednesday, March 7.

Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.   Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.   Likewise, if Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such failure.   Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled volumes.   I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that   the OFO provisions apply.   Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I can verify with the transport group.\n"

I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, my attempt totrack down information on Enron and an ammonia forward market has not as ofyet yielded results (I will continue to investigate).Pursuant to the decision to focus initially financial hedging, riskmanagement strategies, and to understand Mississippi Chemical's riskappetite and hedging objectives,   I offer the following questions:1.   Historically, what percentage of your natural gas consumption have youhedged?   Are your required to have a specific percentage of your exposurehedged, with hedge levels depending differing time horizons?2.   What policies/procedures govern what you can and cannot do with respectto hedging instruments?3.   What is Mississippi Chemical's position on transacting over-the-counterswaps and options?   Is their any policy which requires you to transact onthe exchange?4.   How far out on the curve can you hedge?5.   What is the appropriate conversion factor to be used to calculatenatural gas per ton of product produced (our estimate is 25 MMBtu/ton)?6.   What Green Markets posting (or other postings) are your products tiedto?   If your products are sold based on forward contracts, what is thenormal term of such contracts?   If sold on spot, to what index(es) are theytied?7.   What is your internal price forecast for the price of ammonia for thenext year, 2 years, etc?Hopefully I am not asking for anything too difficult to obtain.   I dorealize we may need to get a confidentiality agreement in place to protectthe transferral of sensitive information.   Please let me know how toproceed.Best regards,Troy Black\n"

MTM value for all options should calculate to be around $230,000.However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.

MTM value for all options should calculate to be around $230,000.However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.   They will not transact at   these levels two years from now without us having to put facilities in the ground.   Please consider a two year extension or tell me what requirements would have to be met to do this.Thanks,GaryFrom: Darren Vanek/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/16/20001 04:36 PMTo: Gary W Lamphier/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Jason R Williams/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: RE: JER/BRE Austin TechGary, As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is executed.

Your email raisedsome questions for us.Specifically, we do not understand your statement that the GISB is aninterruptible contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.The GISB form you mailed us is similar to GISB's which we have received fromother companies.   All specifically state in the bottom disclaimer paragraphof the first page that \"This Contract is intended for Interruptibletransactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and may not besuitable for Firm transactions of longer than one month.\"   Further, in theinterior of the GISB, on Exhibit A, there is a place to check whether onewants firm or interruptible.The intent of this email is to clarify.   Our interpretation is that GISBscan be for firm (which is what we would want to do), and they would be for31 day months as well as 30 day or less. Do you agree with this?If our interpretation is correct, it is not clear why a Master Firm isneeded.   Can you explain what the value add is to our doing business?[Perhaps it would be useful for a case where we wanted to cover our longterm purchases for a combined cycle plant which we intended to operate everyday of the year other than scheduled maintenance outages.]Lastly, in our notes from our meeting, I wrote that Enron had offered aninitial $20MM credit line for Oglethorpe. When doing physical contractseither under a GISB or your Master Firm, does this amount represent a Markto Market limit or a nominal limit?We have our people reviewing GISB, ISDA, and Master Firm as I write this.

I think we had some good discussionyesterday and it seems like we have some things we can work on together.As far as the contracts, a couple of clarifications and an answer to yourquestion below.You should have received a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement via emailand hard copy.   Additionally, you have already received   a GISB contractand a ISDA Agreement.   Here is a brief description of what each of them do:   GISB - Gas Industry Standards Board Agreement - this is an interruptible   contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.   OPC would not be able   to lock forward NYMEX prices on this contract but can purchase short   term supplies.   ISDA - this contract is for financial positions only.   If you wanted to   enter into swaps or derivative based products, you can perform them   under this contract without ever having to take physcial delivery.   Master Firm - Under this contract, OPC will be purchasing firm gas   supply and will be able to lock forward values on the NYMEX.   Note that   this is a physcial contract which will require OPC to take delivery.   OPC will receive a bill from Enron around the 5th after the month of   delivery and will be required to pay no later than the 25th.   If the   25th is on a weekend or holdiay, then the invoice will be due on the   next business day.   OPC payment obligations are always after the month   of delivery no later than the 25th with no need for any payments   beforehand.   Note that under Triggering Event in Section 4.2, either   party may need to provide additional credit assurances in the event of a   material change which could cause a letter of credit to be issued.Let me know if you did not receive the Master Firm Agreement or if you haveany more questions.Thanks.Phil DeMoes\"Bergen, Laurence\" &lt;laurence.bergen@opc.com&lt; on 03/02/20001 111:26:46 AMTo:   \"'phil.demoes@enron.com'\" &lt;phil.demoes@enron.com&lt;cc:Subject:   Physical ContractsPhil,One quick question we forgot to ask yesterday.

The majority of the changes you will see are necessary toconvert a deal-specific contract to something more like a set of \"generalterms and conditions\" that will be supplemented with the deal-specifics in aTransaction Confirmation.   These essential changes include (1) thereplacement of any deal-specific item such as price, point of sale, contractquantity with a reference to the Transaction Confirmation, (2) the inclusionof language for Firm Baseload, Firm Swing and Firm Swing with Term PurchaseQuantity so that all types of purchase arrangements are addressed and (3)the addition of Sections 1, 2 and 4 to introduce and explain \"MasterContract\" and \"Transaction Confirmation\".   These changes necessarily lead tomore definitions.In addition, we have created our own Events of Default language which isalmost identical to Enron's Triggering Events language.   We can discuss anychanges you might like to make to our language.The remaining variances, with 2 notable exceptions, are subject tonegotiation and these include liability language at Section 10.3 and theremoval or replacement of Locked Prices language at Section 8.3.   The 2items we are not willing to change are (1) Section 9 Taxes and (2) theaddition of the previous Collateral Requirement/Termination PaymentThreshold language.   These were accepted last year ONLY because the partieshad agreed to certain purchase terms and the effective date of the contracthad passed.For all the reasons above, we cannot use last year's contract verbatim.However, I believe what we have is, with the 2 exceptions, very similar tolast year's contract.   I appreciate that we all spent a lot of time gettinglast year's contract finalized and it reinforced the need for us to have anexecuted set of general terms &amp; conditions in place PRIOR to the biddingprocess.   We are targeting March 31 for execution of Master Contracts withall parties desiring to bid in Wisconsin Public Service's RFP, which isexpected to take place in early April.I will be out of the office from 10 am today until Monday, but if you needto contact me during this time, either leave a voice mail, which I will bechecking, or send an email which will be forwarded to Tim Sexton.Thanks for your help Dan.Kim DecellGas Supply Consulting, Inc.(281) 5558-0735---Original Message---From: Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com [mailto:Dan.J.Hyvl@enron.com]Sent: Monday, March 19, 20001 10:52 AMTo: Kim DecellCc: Deirdre.McCaffrey@enron.comSubject: Re: WPS contractKim,   I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form ofMaster Contract.

Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity or Minimum Daily Quantity.   Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities (default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language.---"

      "body": "\nKim, What is meant by a \"new review of this agreement\"?   Have they reviewed the master previously?   If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit requirements into the standard agreement?   I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in numerous areas.   I think it is a form they put together for use with a Canadian producer.   The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other parties.   The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.   Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not signed, no agreement.   Let's discuss where we go from here.\tKim Ward\t03/12/20001 05:17 PM \t\t\t To: Dan Hyvl\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: RE:Dan,This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.

In HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas Railroad Commission.   This allows HPL to use this margin determined as provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its maximum rate for 3111 service.   That is one of the reasons that HPL continues to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have such information. Please reforward your message to me after the 18th so that I can contact Aquila concerning where we next proceed concerning HPL's contract. mrgraves@aep.com\t06/08/20001 09:49 AM \t\t\t To: dan.j.hyvl@enron.com\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Aquila Contract and 3111 Grandfathered TransportationDan,Per our phone conversation, please contact Kathy Dirks with Aquila EnergyMarketing, Corporation regarding the final negotiations of their mastercontract.

We have the following important comments: (1) The first page of the Guaranty refers to specific Contracts that will be covered by the Guaranty and one identified Contract is the Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/ Sale Agreement.? As you are aware, this Contract has not been signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.? Therefore we request that the Guaranty language be broadened to include all Obligations of the Enron entities to CME (and not be Contract specific).(2)The third page of the Guaranty discusses Maximum Limit (Section 2) and sets specific numerical caps for each of the covered Enron entities.? We had requested for a unified Cap earlier and once again request that a unified Cap be set for all entities.? (3)The fifth page of the Guaranty (Section 9), says that this Guaranty will supersede the Old Guaranty that was issued jointly to Engage US and Engage Canada.? As you are aware, we are not affiliated or connected with Engage Canada and therefore cannot bind Engage Canada whatsoever in the proposed Guaranty.? That was the rationale for our insert in that paragraph (\"insofar as it respects Contract Party\").?

We suggest, if it is necessary, a conference call involving ourselves and our Counsel.Please respond at your earliest convenience.

      "body": "\nRussell, Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are covered by our contracts.   Non contract amounts should not be subject the the guarantee, incoming or outgoing.   Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron entity.   This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's new parent will need to take its place.   Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this takes the action of their spun off entity.Clement, Do you agree?\tRussell Diamond\t01/16/20001 12:35 PM \t\t\t To: Clement Abrams/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Coastal Merchant Energy---Outgoing GtyClement, Dan,Please give me an update on this guaranty.Thank you,Russell---"

You use the term DCQ and you also talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.   Normally their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.   3.   Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.   Is the price the same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 20%.   Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than the estimated quantity?   What if they take more than 20% in excess without making any arrangements for incremental gas.   What price is to be used for such non scheduled excess volumes?   Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the transaction agreement.   \tDave Fuller\t04/29/20001 12:14 PM \t\t\t To: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Mark Whitt/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven P South/Enron@EnronXGate\t\t\t Subject: EWEB gas saleDan,The attached term sheet describes a gas sale we are proposing to the Eugene Water and Electric Board.

Master Firm Purchase/Sale AgreementDan:I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help meresolve it.   As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress thefact that we \"need\" \"financially firm\" language in all contracts.   When theTrader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about histrading intentions and it was assumed that \"financially firm\" \"needed\" tobe in the contract.   It seems that this language is now holding up theexecution process of the Enovate LLC contract.   The Business Unit wants\"financially firm\" out and \"firm\" substituted.The definition for \"firm\" that they want in the contract is the standarddefinition for \"firm\" that is in the GISB as follows:\"Firm\" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance withoutliability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasonsof Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeureinterruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for anyimbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruptionafter the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change indeliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.I believe the only other place in the contract that \"Financially Firm\"appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,would you please change that occurrence of \"Financially Firm\" to just\"firm\"?Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?   On thefirst page, we can line through \"Financially\" and initial, and then justthe definition page on the first page of APPENDIX \"1\" would have to beredone to replace \"Financially Firm\" with just \"Firm\".Please let me know if this is able to be done.Thanks and I'm so sorry,Ellen Dailey713/207-32666\n"

Regarding the Financially Firm language, I would suggest that you line through the word Financially in each case where it occurs in the contract, line through the entire definition of Financially Firm and have the person who signs for Reliant initial each of the line outs.   I do not feel that we need to define the term Firm.   Our view of the contract is that the obligations are always firm so no further clarification is needed.   Do you concur?   If so, forward the signed and initialled contracts together with the signed Transaction Agreements and I will have the enovate officer also initial the line outs and return a final fully executed contract to you.

So, I politely told the Accountant that theinfo in the gas management system was correct as entered.

Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/000 was moved to Sitara deal 1333958 (cannot find Tagg number).   Deal 1311153 was originally confirmed under a Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of the CP name on the deal ticket.   The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the confirm out of Tagg. I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).   I'm guessing the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.   Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.   One note:   The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have been attached to the GISB.Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard Deming.   On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able to help.   I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 1311153 (before it was split) since it's the only record I could pull up.Sorry I couldn't find you everything!SBRDEBRA PERLINGIERE05/17/20001 02:30 PMTo: Stacey Richardson/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Exxon/HPL GISB   1311153 1333958 156438 107197Debra PerlingiereEnron North America Corp.Legal Department14000 Smith Street, EB 38885Houston, Texas 7770002dperlin@enron.comPhone 713-853-7658Fax   713-646-3490\n"

Just as she was&lt;&lt;about to make&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; her&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; first cut into the ice, a booming voice from the sky&lt;&lt;bellowed, \"There&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; are&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; no fish under the ice!\" Startled, the blonde grabbed up all&lt;&lt;her&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; belongings, moved further along the ice, poured some hot&lt;&lt;chocolate&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; from&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; her thermos, and started to cut a new hole. Again the voice&lt;&lt;from&lt;&lt;above&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; bellowed, \"There are no fish under the ice!\"&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; Amazed, the blonde wasn't quite sure what to do, as this&lt;&lt;certainly&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; wasn't&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; covered in any of her books. She packed up her gear and&lt;&lt;moved to the&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; far&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; side of the ice. Once there, she stopped for a few moments&lt;&lt;to regain&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; her&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; calm. Then she was extremely careful to set everything up&lt;&lt;perfectly,&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; tools&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; in the right place, chair positioned just so, everything.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; Just as she was about to cut this new hole, the voice came&lt;&lt;again,&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; \"There&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; are no fish under the ice!\"&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; Petrified, the blonde looked skyward and asked \"Is that you&lt;&lt;Lord?\"&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; The voice boomed back, \"No, this is the manager of the&lt;&lt;skating rink!\" \n"

Transactions are only formed by signing an Exhibit A to be prepared by National.   The Exhibit A is to have a Daily Transaction Quantity and National may nominate from 0 to 1000% of that quantity each day.   Penalties only arise if the actual quantity deviates from their nominated quantity.   Seller to pay difference between Buyer's replacement price and the Gas Commodity Charge times the deficiency quantity.   Buyer to pay difference between the Gas Commodity Charge and the Daily Midpoint Price times the deficiency quantity.   Does not state what quantity is to be applied against the Gas Demand Charge; however, does state that if Seller has a force majeure the Gas Demand Charge is only applied against the actual volumes that Seller delivers and that the Gas Demand Charge is not reduced if Buyer declares a Force Majeure.   Buyer's payments are to be trued up to the actual quantities delivered should actuals deviate from the nominated quantities.

I have attached two word documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.   One is FGU's general information and the other is our special provisions.   Please have your contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract and have it sent to me for review and execution.

It was so nice to have all the momsthat are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once.Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me knowwhat to bring and I'll be there.In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her intoa nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost intears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attemptto assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her testsand medicines as she needs to.I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account whichrequires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $5000 or $1000...whatever weagree is a \"safe\" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, Ifeel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs ordesires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not \"take control\"of her money...just help her \"remember\" payment of large purchases. Shestill needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern issomeone \"conning\" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel.Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see theday-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and myattention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom...and between the 3of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets hermaintain her dignity and respect.OK&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need tobring...Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be sonice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe itwon't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured...Think about it, ifyou'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday...maybeChristmas? ...Just a thought.BettyeBettye___Send a cool gift with your E-Cardhttp:///www.bluemountain.com/giftcenter/\n"

Tell Mom that we are taking her out for her birthday or elseshe will try to cook everthing. Then we can all show up with the food.I don't know what to say about how she would feel about losing control ofher checking account. Some days she seems really concerned about what shehas in the bank and other times she handles things well. She did give Buddya signed blank check to go pay for fertilizer on a Sat. and then when hewent to pay for it on Mom. evening she had already gone in and paid for itherself that morning. She had forgotten she had told him to do it.She stillthinks she will be put in a nursing home if she forgets things. She told usagain Sunday that they put Aunt Minnie in a nursing home because she forgotthe stove on. Though i'm sure it was more to it than that.

Haley sure loves the necklace that&lt; Bettye gave her.   She was out from the time we hit the road until about&lt; 6:30 this morning.

I think that this is a deal that we are interested in looking at.John and Jim, I think the only question we will have for you immediately are the bankruptcy implications associated with the advance payments.   PG&amp;E claims there are none (of course).Dan, since you reviewed the original PG&amp;E (Core) Master Agreement, can you review the proposed amendments to that Master?   Mark --- I don't think Enron Canada is a party to the PGE Master.   Can you take a look at the form ENA executed and see if there is any reason why Enron Canada couldn't execute the same form?Note that PG&amp;E also wants to be re-established to trade on EnronOnline.   I understand the only impediment to that is that the masters need to be amended to provide that Enron, not PG&amp;E, is the confirming party, and that we were on our way to documenting those amendments when this all blew up a few months ago.   Dan, can you resurrect those amendments so we can see if we can weave them into these amendments?

I assume this is still correct?Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL contract for the collateral threshold matter???   It is a typical HPL physical contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and I'll fax it to you.Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing anything.ThanksLee\n"

I also think that Elizabeth would let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal.   This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read \"added user tag\").   I just realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't subtract 12:000 from military time).   I apologize.I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.   Maybe we have a Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.   I know we sometimes to have to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done that already and still don't see a contract.   Let me know if you see the same thing.I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs. face-to-face communication.   I just wanted to make sure you knew about our policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.FYI - once a telephonic deal has a contract attached, it will stay in your portfolio until the deal is VALIDATED.Hope this clears everything up!Thanks,SBRSharon Gonzales@ENRON02/26/20001 08:30 AMTo: Stacey Richardson/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Sitara deal 6371118   Hi Stacey,I was not aware of that deal, and actually did not leave till about 5:15 on Friday. I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.   I have two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.It has always been my practice to keep checking the telephonic and make sure they do have contracts attached since they sit out there so long.Thanks,SharonStacey Richardson@ECT02/26/20001 07:59 AMTo: Sharon Gonzales/NA/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Sitara deal 6371118Hi Sharon,I was checking the portfolios this morning and noticed a deal input on Friday around 4:30 that didn't have a contract attached.   We usually don't get too many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check your portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.   Even though this deal won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every day.   We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.   I also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached (non-problem) deals each day.Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular deal.   I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make sure we don't get nailed on it some day.   I know you've been pretty busy handling other desks as well, and I appreciate that.Thanks!SBR\n"

Harley is wanting to lock-in a fixed price for a firm volume for part of his gas, about 40%-50%.   Cutter has in the past locked-in fixed prices for firm volumes and most likey will do so in the future.   Two producers, Cutter Oil &amp; Harley Drilling, wanting to lock-in fixed prices for firm volumes for gas flowing through one meter owned by Cutter Oil:Is there a method to lock-in a portion of Harley's production at a fixed price which flows through Cutter's meter?What contractual language needs be added to the ENFOLIO GAS PURCHASE AGREEMENT?Should an addendum be added to both contracts (Harley and Cutter)?John \n"

The reason it was assigned back to ENA was that it needed to reside in ENA through July 1999.   Thereafter it could be assigned to HPL.   If I don't find the copy, everything got scuffled in the move, I will reassign effective as of August 1, 1999.

HPL has received an amendment to contract 9600022201 between HPL and Union wherein it refers to an assignment between EING and HPL.   Our clerk, Cathy Harris, spoke to Dan Hyvl concerning the Enron entity name discrepancy and obtained a copy of the assignment effective 5/1/000 which includes Union Carbide as a contract to be assigned.   The contract was evidently not assigned on the 5/1/000 date.   Please have someone in your group make this correction and let me know when the correction is completed so that we can process the amendment timely.   aa \n"

As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5 year phase-in plan that would be known as \"Euro-English\".In the first year, \"s\" will replace the soft \"c\". Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard \"c\" will be dropped in favour of the\"k\". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter.There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year,?when the troublesome \"ph\" will be replaced with \"f\". This will make words like \"fotograf\" 20% shorter.In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be ekspekted to reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent \"e\"s in the language is disgraseful, and they should go away.By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing \"th\" with \"z\" and \"w\" with \"v\". During ze fifz year,?ze unesesary \"o\" kan be dropd from vords kontaining \"ou\" and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer kombinations of leters.After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer. Ze drem vil finali kum tru! And zen ve vil tak over ze   world!\n"

The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof. Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a rather stern voice, \"Skippy!\"The woman thought, \"This is great!\" and a big smile came across her face. A couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The father again looked and the dog and yelled, \"Dammit Skippy!\"Once again the woman smiled and thought \"Yes!\" A few minutes later the woman had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, \"Dammit Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!\"\n"

Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the optionto move gas after 9:000am.Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to thesubject agreement.Thanks,---Bruce KohrsPhone: (403)205-7684Fax: (403)2666-1947e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.comRE: Transaction No. 1a; March 222, 20001We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under thesubject agreement.The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:000 am on aNomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or willdeliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to havesufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilizeallof Customer's AOS.   Should circumstances change after 9:000 am on aNomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes availableon the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOSto deliver those additional volumes.If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlinedabove, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy ofthis letter provided for that purpose.---Bruce KohrsPhone: (403)205-7684Fax: (403)2666-1947e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com\n"
