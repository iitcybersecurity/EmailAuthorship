We havenot sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.To review the phone conversation between Jan and me, we are planning to shutdown our last steam plant for maintenance from midnight March 30, 20001through 18000 or so April 111, 20001.   Kim and I have arranged for Enron topurchase the non-APEA gas during that period.   At this time, we believe thatthe power plant will burn enough gas during the last 20 days of the month touse the APEA gas.   If anything changes, I will notify you.If you have any questions, please contact me.Thanks.-Steve\n"

I hope you remember my story when they start gettingfrustrated! My three year old son had a lot of problemswithpotty training; and I was on him constantly. One day westopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch between errands. It wasvery busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco Ismelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven monthold daughter. And she was clean. Then I realized that Matt had notasked to go potty in a while, so I asked, and he said, \"No.\" I keptthinking, \"Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have anyclothes with me.\"Then I said, \"Matt, are you sure you did nothave an accident?\" \"No,\" he replied. I just knew that he must havehad, because the smell was getting worse. So I asked onemore time, \"Matt, did you have an accident?\" This time hejumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread h! ischeeks and yelled \"SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!\" While1000 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, hecalmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as ifnothing had happened. I was mortified but some kind elderlypeople made me feel a lot better when they came over and thanked mefor the best laugh they had ever had\n"

Burns' clothes caught on something, however, and&lt;&lt;&lt;   the other man found Burns \"wrapped in the drive shaft.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 3: [Hickory Daily Record]&lt;&lt;&lt;   Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in&lt;&lt;&lt;   December in Newton, N.C. Awakening to the sound of a ringing&lt;&lt;&lt;   telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed&lt;&lt;&lt;   instead a Smith Wesson .38 Special, which discharged when he drew&lt;&lt;&lt;   it to his ear.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 4: [UPI, Toronto]&lt;&lt;&lt;   Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a&lt;&lt;&lt;   downtown Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his&lt;&lt;&lt;   shoulder and plunged 24   floors to his death. A police spokesman&lt;&lt;&lt;   said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the courtyard of the Toronto&lt;&lt;&lt;   Dominion Bank Tower early Friday evening as he was explaining the&lt;&lt;&lt;   strength of the building's windows to visiting law students. Hoy&lt;&lt;&lt;   previously has conducted demonstration of window strength&lt;&lt;&lt;   according to police reports. Peter Lawyers, managing partner of&lt;&lt;&lt;   the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that&lt;&lt;&lt;   Hoy was \"one of the best and brightest\" members of the 2000-man&lt;&lt;&lt;   association.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 5: [Bloomsburg News Service]&lt;&lt;&lt;   A terrible diet and room with no ventilation are being blamed for&lt;&lt;&lt;   the death of a man who was killed by his own gas. There was no&lt;&lt;&lt;   mark on his body but an autopsy showed large amounts of methane&lt;&lt;&lt;   gas in his system. His diet had consisted primarily of beans and&lt;&lt;&lt;   cabbage (and a couple of other things). It was just the right&lt;&lt;&lt;   combination of foods. It appears that the man died in his sleep&lt;&lt;&lt;   from breathing the poisonous cloud that was hanging over his bed.&lt;&lt;&lt;   Had he been outside or had his windows been opened, it wouldn't&lt;&lt;&lt;   have been fatal.   But the man was shut up in his near air-tight&lt;&lt;&lt;   bedroom.   According to the article, \"He was a big man with a huge&lt;&lt;&lt;   capacity for creating \"this deadly gas.\" Three of the rescuers got&lt;&lt;&lt;   sick and one was hospitalized.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 6: [The News of the Weird.]&lt;&lt;&lt;   Michael Anderson Godwin made news of the Weird posthumously. He&lt;&lt;&lt;   had spent several years awaiting South Carolina's electric chair&lt;&lt;&lt;   on a murder conviction before having his sentence reduced to life&lt;&lt;&lt;   in prison. Whilst sitting on a metal toilet in his cell and&lt;&lt;&lt;   attempting to fix his small TV set, he bit into a wire and was&lt;&lt;&lt;   electrocuted.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE NO. 7: [\"The Indianapolis Star\"].&lt;&lt;&lt;   A cigarette lighter may have triggered fatal explosion in Dunkirk,&lt;&lt;&lt;   Indiana.   A Jay County man using a cigarette lighter to check the&lt;&lt;&lt;   barrel of a muzzle loader was killed Monday night when the weapon&lt;&lt;&lt;   discharged in his face, sheriff's investigators said. Gregory&lt;&lt;&lt;   David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home about&lt;&lt;&lt;   111:30 pm.   Investigators said Pryor was cleaning a 54-caliber&lt;&lt;&lt;   muzzle loader that had not been firing properly. He was using the&lt;&lt;&lt;   lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder ignited.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No. 8: [Reuters, Mississauga, Ontario] A man cleaning a&lt;&lt;&lt;   bird Feeder on the balcony of his condominium apartment in this&lt;&lt;&lt;   Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death.   Stefan&lt;&lt;&lt;   Macko, 555, was standing on a wheeled chair when the accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   occurred, said Inspector D'Arcy Honer of the Peel regional police.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"It appears the chair moved and he went over the balcony,\" Honer&lt;&lt;&lt;   said.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   NOMINEE No.9: [Arkansas Democrat Gazette] Two local men were&lt;&lt;&lt;   seriously injured when their pick-up truck left the road and&lt;&lt;&lt;   struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday&lt;&lt;&lt;   morning. Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   shortly after midnight Monday. Thurston Poole, 333, of Des Arc and&lt;&lt;&lt;   Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in serious&lt;&lt;&lt;   condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred as the&lt;&lt;&lt;   two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On an&lt;&lt;&lt;   overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights&lt;&lt;&lt;   malfunctioned.   The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on&lt;&lt;&lt;   the older model truck had burned out. As a replacement fuse was&lt;&lt;&lt;   not available,   Wallis noticed that the .222 caliber bullet from&lt;&lt;&lt;   his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to the steering&lt;&lt;&lt;   wheel column.   Upon inserting the bullet, the headlights again&lt;&lt;&lt;   began to operate properly and the two men proceeded on east-bound&lt;&lt;&lt;   toward the White River bridge. After traveling approximately 20&lt;&lt;&lt;   miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently&lt;&lt;&lt;   overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The&lt;&lt;&lt;   vehicle swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement and&lt;&lt;&lt;   striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from&lt;&lt;&lt;   the accident, but will require surgery to repair the other wound.&lt;&lt;&lt;   Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and released.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls&lt;&lt;&lt;   off or we might both be dead\" stated Wallis. \"I've been a trooper&lt;&lt;&lt;   for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a first for&lt;&lt;&lt;   me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident&lt;&lt;&lt;   happened,\" said Snyder.   Upon being notified of the wreck,&lt;&lt;&lt;   Lavinia, Poole's wife, asked how many frogs the boys had caught&lt;&lt;&lt;   and did anyone get them from the truck.

Being&lt;the&lt;polite gentleman he is, Bill went to visit Sally and ask her if she needed&lt;any questions answered. She said no, so Bill asked, \"Have you seen the&lt;presidential clock yet?\"&lt;&lt;Sally replied, \"I haven't even heard of the presidential clock.\"&lt;&lt;Bill then replied, \"Well let's go to my office, so I can show it to you.\"&lt;&lt;Sally was a little taken aback, and she stated, \"With all the problems&lt;you've had lately, I don't think we should.\"&lt;&lt;Then Bill said, \"Ahh, it's just a clock and I promise I won't try&lt;anything.\"&lt;&lt;Sally then agrees to go with him.&lt;&lt;Bill leads her to the Oval Office, shuts and locks the door behind them and&lt;then drops his pants to the floor. Sally is flabbergasted and says, \"Mr.&lt;President, that is the presidential cock, not the presidential clock.\"&lt;&lt;Bill looks at her and says, \"Sally, by my definition, if you put two hands&lt;and a face on it, it's a clock.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;___Get more from the Web.

This oddnumber is made up of the sum of the following:1. 4,026MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&amp;ENW   losses4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @$7.71/MMMBtu;4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;4. 5000MMBtu/day March 20001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;Losses on the PG &amp; E line have decreased again from April 20001 to 2.63%.   Wehave not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.We will still operate with only one steam unit (Broadway 3) on line for mostof the month.   Sometime about the fourth week of May, we will be bringingone more steam unit on line.   At that time, I may need to increase ournomination.   With the increasing temperatures and the possibility that theISO will begin paying generators, we expect our fuel usage to actually reachand occasionally exceed our nomination in May.If you have any questions, please contact me.Thanks.-Steve\n"

As for me, I got married to a great guy named Patrick that i met during our last semester at UT.   We actually got set up on a blind date by Rachel Hanson.   Anyway, we'll be married 6 years in June and we're expecting our first child in June.   I spent a few years after college as a clothing buyer for Foley's, but I now am doing something completely different that I absolutely love.   I work for Enron - big energy trading company - wasnt sure if you knew who we were.   I'm trading natural gas, and it's a really fun job that's fast-paced and challenging.   My hubby is an account manager for an internet company that has not yet gone public but their prospects are looking pretty good.   We bought a house in Sugarland about 3.5 years ago, but we sold it in August and moved into a new house that we built in Katy.   We wanted to be close to my parents and also closer to San Antonio - where Pat is from - his parents still live there.   Anyway - I guess that's it in a nutshell.   Oh yeah - and my address is:44419 Stackstone Ln.Katy, TX 777450I hope we can keep in touch.   I'm not travelling right now, but if you ever make it to Houston - I'd love to see you.   Give me some more details in the next email!Take Care and Happy Holidays!   Love, Tori\n"

We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would also have to change the description of the original index product as well. I left you a message to call me if you can today.   Thanks.\n"

They stand at the bar, drinking their beers and talking quietly about cattle prices.Suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a sandwich, begins to cough. After a minute or so it becomes apparent that she is in real distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her.\"Kin ya swaller? asks one of the cowboys.No, the woman shakes her head.\"Kin ya breathe?\" asks the other.The woman, beginning to turn a bit blue, shakes her head No again. The first cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt, yanks down her panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the small of her back.This shocks the woman to a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her mouth, and she begins to breathe again.The cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a drink of his beer. His partner says, \"Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick Maneuver, but, I never seen anybody do it.\"\n"

      "body": "\nHello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).   My husband, Patrick( One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as well as elite members on several occasions.   We also use Chase Continental Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.   I have made Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.   This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.   I booked tickets for a vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on December 1.   Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due to complications with my pregnancy.   My doctor indicated to me that I may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.   I spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on September 5th, 20001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I book a ticket for me or my husband.   I understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel like taking a vacation this weekend.   In my opinion, this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications.   As you can see with my situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a vacation by September of 20001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month old child.   I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy.   I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.   He was very rude to me, stating \"You don't have to ask me 7 different times for the same thing - I already told you NO!\"   I had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping that I would be able to fly again by now.   For your information, your competitor was very helpful.   They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another person's name if I am still unable to use it.   That ticket was also booked as a non-refundable fare.   Although I have always used Continental   for my personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second-guess my future choices.   If there is anything you can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.\n"
