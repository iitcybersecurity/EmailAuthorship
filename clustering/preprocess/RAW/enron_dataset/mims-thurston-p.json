This price was increased to $16.000 to encompass trades transacted via the telephone. The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:Nicor Gas Company was closed for   their company holiday on Friday, December 222nd.   As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for   the December 222-26 time period.   Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 222-26 time period.   Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 222nd (even though they were closed)   for the December 23-26 time period, which resulted in a $13.888 posting for the December 23-26th period.   I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 222nd.   While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.

As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to start commercial service effective November 13, 2000.   As with any new pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.   I would like to create a product that has a description that addresses the uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.Thank you\n"

He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.   He is taking regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain, which he's in half the time.   It's really sad.   He's lost alot of weight, but he's in good spirits I guess.   To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.   It's was really hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act, so that I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see your parents going through this kind of suffering.He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over matter, along with lots of prayer.Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't want her to do it.   Daddy says he's going back to work.   Please pray for Mom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really do.Talk to you later!\n"

Seems like the older people get, the crazier they get.   That reminds me when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa.   I answered the telephone at her house and they said \"Is Louisa there, and She said, oh that's for me\".   I cracked up!Anyway, funny thing happened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was standing the lobby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was Patrice.   Turned out he was Birdell's son, Dupree, remember him?   He's back down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes.   He's turned into a nice looking young man.   I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.   She seems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.   I'll call her back one of these days when I have more time.Missed you at Jordan's party.   Silly me, I didn't figure it out until Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift.   I initially thought it was from Shayla.Well anyway, you rolling?\n"

I made the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites, the rate is $159.000 per night, pretty expensive, but the Nascar is in town, and we can split it three ways.   Hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room, although I did not ask, I asked for two queen beds, in case there is not.   Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set.   I spoke with Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see if she could improve that rate, so far I have not heard anything back from her yet, nor am I holding my breath.   She said her colors are burgundy and gold, if I remember correctly.   Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that Jordan was so good, that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class for his age group.   This class is called the \"Hope Team\"   and it gets the kids ready for competition.   I did not realize he was that good, although I could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud Mom).   I called to inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me\" Ma'm you have to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and I said, yes, ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!\" Well, anyway, we'll   see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. each day.   We'll see, I know he would really enjoy it.Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd.   I was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more I think about it, he'll probably want to be in Jordan's class (oh boy!!!).I spoke with Daddy last week, and he's supposed to be checking into possibly getting tickets to come down for Thanksgiving.

He said that everything was okay financially   for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.   He sounded okay with me asking about it.   He even said \"You are so sweet with words\".He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.   We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.   In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.   They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.   All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.   Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.   Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.   I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10   minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.   Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.   So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.   I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)   She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.Talk with you later\n"

      "body": "\nHey Nella,When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last Friday.   He said that everything was okay financially   for the future, and they only had an immediate need for the tax money.   He sounded okay with me asking about it.   He even said \"You are so sweet with words\".He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.   We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.   In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.   They call it bumper bowling because they put up little bumpers.   All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl one day after we get off work.   Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.   Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.   I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm running about 10   minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.   Now the heffa was late one day last week and I didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last week.   So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.   I want to call up their and complain, but I think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)   She needs to get her stuff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.Talk with you later\n"

      "body": "\nI talked to Moma last night and she said that Daddy's cancer cells were all gone as far as the prostate cancer is concerned, as a result of the radiation.   She cautioned me not to get too excited because the Dr. said the cancer will reappear, but they don't know where.   She said Daddy has not been in any pain for a couple of weeks now.   It seems that the problem right now is the vomiting and nausea.   She said they had a Dr's appt. today to see about it.   She said Daddy is soo skinney.Daddy has not responded to my e-mail, so I think I am right,,, because normally if you are alright financially, you quickly tell people, but in this case, I have not heard back from him.   Strange!   Anyway, if this is true, I might have to put my part-time employment ideas on hold for a little while longer, because I will not have them going without, and I will not have Momma going back to a regular full time job under any circumstances.   I was kind of thinking that anyway, with the stock market taking a nosedive the way it did with my retirement money.   Anyway, talk with you later.P.S. I forgot to tell you that I am working out three times a week for an hour each time.   Our boss is letting us leave at 4:000 p.m. to go to the company gym to work out.   It's about 6 or 7 of us doing it.   It's much more fun working out with a group as opposed to by yourself.   Maybe I'll see some results one day.Talk with you later.\n"

So, just remind me, I will never go back over there.   I sure hate that you missed seeing the baptismal pool! Boy, what a difference a day makes in the weather.   Last night, Todd cleaned out the closet, because of the potential tornado threat.   I was a little unnerved, especially with the kids.   I had the kids put on their shoes and socks and whatnot, just in case something happened.   I was a praying sister.   That really scared me.

I looked for you guys and I said, oh well, I'll catch them later.   By the way, I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening, January 222, 2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway,   Yes I'm having it on a Monday night after work (6:30 p.m.) because I can't stand that place, and Jordan has his heart set on it.   It's always too crowded and it drives me crazy!   So I figure, we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:000 p.m. and be out of there by 8:30 p.m.   It's not the best plan, but it beats a Friday, Saturday or a Sunday.   I'm just inviting about 6 people. so it'll definitely be small   Let me know if you're interested.See you soon!.\n"

The weather was a little chillier than Houston, and as a result I have a little cold and sore throat.   The wedding was very nice.   The wedding itself was in a small church, but somewhat elegant.   The reception was \"the bomb\".   It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money, money.   I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money.   She had a reception for around 150 to 250 people.   I'm not good at looking at a crowd and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.   She had a buffet dinner (mainly sandwiches, but they were good), all kind of party favors, beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something different, a band, a dj and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas.   It was really nice.   Again, I hope she did not go into too much debt, but it was nice.   She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride.   We went shopping and sight-seeing.   We even went to go find the grade school that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix   many, many years ago.   It was alot of fun actually remincescing (you know what word I'm trying to say).Did you go to church Sunday?   If so, how was it?   I really did miss not going to church.   How was the rest of your weekend?   Kids and Steve doing okay?   I can't wait to see you tomorrow night, it seems likes it been a long time.Talk to you later.   I will be home tonight, so I'll call you or you call me when we get the kids wound down!\n"

I've learned alot with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not communicate.   I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for pain and   discomfort when, most   times, there is so combination of medicines that will get the job done.   I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your \"breakthrough\" on the radio.   I told her, if only the audience knew what you were talking about!I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were closed,I forgot about the time difference.   I 'm probably hesitating because I know everyone wants to go to Washington, and I;'m not quite sure that this is the right place.   What are your thoughts?Well anyway, good luck on the \"butt procedure\", boy you and your butt\".   Hope it's not too painful.Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening.Is this your home e-mail or your office?\n"

If so, what time did you get back home, I know it was late.   I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what they had in the way of western attire for the kids.   They did not have much, and the hats for $2.999 were on back order.   I was looking for western shirts for the kids, but they did not have a good selection, so I went to a Western store on Gessner.   Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high.   Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.   I walked out saying that these people are serious about their western wear.I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on my headphones.   It sure helps alot.   I can get away with it, because we have certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear   headphones to hear, so it looks good.   Plus, the boss doesn't mind.   We listen to music just about all day anyway.   Have you heard the Chester D.T. Baldwin tape.   I think it's one of my favorites.   Speaking of gospel, is your family   still planning on   doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for the family reunion?   I was wondering about that!Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet, I want to call her, but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her business.

Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or are you not going to know anything until tomorrow?   I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk to you tonight.Rev. Jackson called me yesterday.   I thought that was funny, he said they had told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything.   He then went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because I was a generous contributor.   I then proceeded to give him a piece of my mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church.   By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church.   That's interesting.   I can only imagine what happened there!Anyway, do you have your African attire yet?   I have some, but it's old, and I had been thinking about buying something new.   I might go to Sharpstown and have a look, but that is not set in stone.   It depends on what type of time I have and what type of mood I'm in.   You know we're supposed to wear our African attire on Sunday.   You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan Church on Sunday at 3:000 p.m.   I'm pretty sure I won't be attending.   I'm tired of going to the same places.   We need some variety.   Gregg needs to get some new \"hook-ups\" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the outings.   And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.   If we have to sing \"In the Sanctuary\"   one more time, I'm going to throw up.   I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off.   It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.See you later!!!\n"

So quite naturally, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.   So needless to say, I have a little bit of time on my hands.   The boys are going over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I will just stay downtown.   I understand that you guys had some bad weather as well, I know Mom was out of school.I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they will enjoy it so much.   Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.   Todd bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now.   It's really cute.   On the other hand, Jordan was feeling a little neglected because of Kendall's cake and presents, but he's okay.   It was just   a new experience, him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys.Anyway, I'll send your tape.See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basisLove Bernie\n"

I can't believe we are so ill-prepared.   We've only had two non-dedicated practices for the program.We are required to spend the night downtown tonight (I'll be at the Double Tree Allen Center) because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not being able to get in tomorrow morning.   It's supposed to rain or lightly mist tonight between 111:000 p.m. and 8:000 a.m.   The streets are supposed to be treacherous if this thing materializes, so be very careful, in fact, you might want to talk with your supervisor   to come up with a contingency plan for the weather.Anyway, that's all for now, talk with you later!\n"

Sometime, please tell me what \"A Day in the Life of Rev. Jackson\" is like at SWCBC.   Do you see alot of people all day long (during the day)?   So often, it's hard to picture the church as being active all day long.   It just seems like people attend meetings and services about twice a week in the evenings.   Funny, how we get perceptions in our heads.My day is going pretty good so far, I'm back to making money in my \"book\" here at work and it sure feels good.   I've always remembered what you told me during my \"crisis period\" and always keep those things in mind.   The one that I like the best is \"Just keep your mind stayed on him, He'll keep you in perfect peace\".   I take that with me everywhere I go.Well, anyway, thanks for the words of encouragement.Appreciate it!\n"

My trip to Omaha was okay.   On one hand, itgave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.   It'snot real good, but he feels optimistic.   You know he has prostate cancerand I believe it has started spreading into the bones.   He's very, veryweak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically wornout.   Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that manyplaces).   He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.   He is takingregular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain,which he's in half the time.   It's really sad.   He's lost alot of weight,but he's in good spirits I guess.   To talk to him over the phone or hearhim over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.   It's was reallyhard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to puton his best act, so that I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to seeyour parents going through this kind of suffering.He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind overmatter, along with lots of prayer.Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn'twant her to do it.   Daddy says he's going back to work.   Please pray forMom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to reallydo.Talk to you later!\n"

Back in the day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience, but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.   I think it's one of those things that once you \"get your foot in the door\", you can move on from there.Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he has time to visit with you.   I think that by simply expressing an interest, and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.   Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.   They're actually pretty good about that!   I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!Take care!\n"

      "body": "\nHello,How was your weekend?   My weekend was great visiting with my family.   Everyone is doing fine.   Daddy is doing okay.   The radiation treatments put the prostate cancer in remission, although the Dr. said the cancer would just move to another part of his body.   He thinks it may have moved to his leg,   He had a MRI done last week, and today he will get the results, and he's so afraid he's going to need surgery again.   He's has to use a walker to get around and he's lost so much weight, he probably went from 170 to l000.   It's really sad, he is so small and frail.   He's starting to get his appetite back somewhat.   He sure had a good time eating this weekend.   My sister and I threw down on Easter dinner.   Please keep him in your prayers.   It's so sad to see a vibrant man reduced to needing help in everything he does, but he's definitely a BLESSED MAN!How was church services on Sunday?   Did you make it to all the services, (I don't even know why I'm asking, I know you didn't go to all of them, that's a bit much).   Did Greg show out on Easter?   Anything new going on with the choir, did you sing any of your songs.   This month is going to be extremely busy with the revivial and the other church outing.You know I never did get a   chance to ask you what all you ended up purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day.Anyway, talk with you later!\n"
