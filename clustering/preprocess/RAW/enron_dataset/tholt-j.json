      "subject": "El Paso Complaint",
      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nBelow is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs   of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and the gathering fuel was increased.   Accordingly, producers are seeking a minimum of $17   million in compensation in some form or   another.The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the Socal Topock which can only deliver 54000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to as Gatekeeper)...   The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could be implemented as early as October 1, 20001.   When the Gatekeeper is implemented   , only 54000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock border and must match up with the intra-state transport.   SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the capapcity-   4000 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;   and 180 to PGE Topock.   They also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but   needed a minimum of 3000 to meet core needs.   However, they wanted some type of compensation if their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo until the Gatekeeper was implemented.   This would result in firm rights being established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.After much discussion,   El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.   Does not relate to receipt point rights.1)   Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or Ehrenberg.   It is recommended that they give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional   7000 mmbtu/day from Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 1115000 being shifted   to Ehrenberg.4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave TopockTexaco   40   135Burlington   26   74Aero   5   15Borax   7   12LADWP   0   36SWGas   0   205) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:Expansion Shippers   78000 Socal Gas   425000BLK 3   348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;999-Williams;189 El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)Total 851000540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El Paso's counter -proposal.   Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent thruput increased.   Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other forms of compensation.   For   the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as converting that path to a 1000 volumetric rate.   In other words, if the producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.   If they did not, they would not pay anything.Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.   For volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 1000 percent volumetric rate.Bottom-line is   how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this case.   Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will study   its entirety.   No follow-up meeting was scheduled.Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.   It is thought that if this could be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.   El Paso recommended the following :   Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan based on previous day's   total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 2-4.   This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.   However, eoc's were willing to establish a technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets resolved.Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the bondad.   This process is in its early stages of conflict.   Most people (Duke, Southern, Williams, Coral)   are not on board with this.   I will keep you advised of development.   Please advise if you have any questions.\n"

One of my more emotional moments in the last few months.&lt; Actually, I had teared up and shorted out my computer while attempting&lt; to send a gracious response, the result being an electrical shock that&lt; sent me in a fit of utter gaggle babble whereby I went charging around&lt; my office yelling \"I can solve the California Energy Crisis, I can solve&lt; the California Energy Crisis!\".   Fortunately, I have come to my senses&lt; and have realized I don't need to solve the California Energy Crisis,&lt; they deserve everything they get.&lt;&lt; How are you doing, hopefully, not blowing crap up like Bob and Me&lt; (Leslie-have you talked to Bob lately?).   Yes, we did have a small&lt; \"parting of the pipes\"   herein after referred to as a \"POP\" at our&lt; Shreveport plant.   Luckily, no one hurt, and no resemblance of a 3 Mile&lt; Island Nuclear disaster.&lt;&lt; Deb-It looks like I will be coming down to H-town in the next few&lt; weeks.   My brother (still with Enron-up in Canada) is coming back for a&lt; visit.   When I get the actual date(s) I will let you know and hopefully&lt; we can maybe get together for a bite.&lt;&lt; Again, thanks for the card, it was very thoughtful of you both.&lt;&lt; Larry&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

Also let's discuss any equipment needs you might need such as a data line for access to Internet and any audio video equipment so I can have it arranged.??? Hotels in the area are: The Biltmore, The Westin Bonaventure and The Intercontinental Hotel all within one block of our building.? I believe at the Biltmore we have a special rate if you mention that its for SoCalGas.I'll be telecommuting tomorrow so you can reach me at my cell phone at (213) 248-4053. Thanks very much Ed \n"

Norm has called it for this Friday, presumably to discuss some of the points you raised in your discussion with him (according to the voice mail he left me).   It will be in El Paso, starting at 1:000 pm MT.Unfortunately, I don't think I can make it, and I've left Norm a voice mail message to that effect.   However, I'm not too optimistic about it getting rescheduled for next week.   I'm losing 2-1/2 days going to Las Vegas for the settlement conference as it is, and I will have to get my Order 637 comments finalized by Friday afternoon in order to get them filed next Monday.   We have some big problems with segmentation proposals (or lack thereof) for Columbia and CNG, as well as some issues on several of the other pipelines that filed.---",

      "body": "\nBeen pretty busy these last couple of weeks.Couple of weeks ago I had to go to Los Angeles on short notice.   Accordingly, paid full price and got in first class.   It must have been a new plane because the first class section was huge.   I sat in a chair that was like a lazy boy chair-it had a fott recline and everything.   Also had my own pop up TV and could watch   my choice of 4 movies.   It was truly awesome.   Can't believe what   a small world it is. Went to lobby to get somebreakfast and Patrick Brown was there-ended up having breakfast with him and some ohter Sempra folks.Then I had to go to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.   Stayed at the new Alladin Hotel.   They upgraded me to a suite.   Another great experience.   Bathroom was huge.   Big marble shower and   a   big tub that overlooked the skyline.   Bedroom area and sitting area were nice too.   Shame I was only there one night.Last week was Gas Fair.   Lots of lunches and dinners. There are a lot of new restaurants downtown that we tried out.   Yum-yum. The weather was perfect.   .   Cheri and I went to the spa and had a relaxing afternoon on the last day.   She looks great.   She said you saw her picture of Matthew. He's a cutie.   Parks was a t dinner one night-he hasn't changed-still nice as ever.   Had a lot of fun with Frank Fields too- he hasn't changed a bit .David Livingston was there.   He works for Cinergy but is doing east coast stuff-thank God.   Our retail group   just hired Joe Deschamps and Chris Shireman-remember them?   I bet Joe won't be there by the end of the year-I think he just wanted someone to pay for his way back to Houston.   Just found out that Bob Shiring went to work for Pan Canadian doing east coast stuff.Joe's brother was in town this week-end from Montana.   He picked him up in San Antonio so we had them all week-end .   Went down to Kemah to watch the boats- we went there with Griff that one time.   Boy has it changed.   Tons more stuff to do -especially for the kids.I'm just sick over my tax bill this year.   I exercised a ton of my options-and boy am I paying for it.   I was planning on   maybe paying $25000   but I am having to pay $47000.   Will probably be that way next year too.   Just sucks that the government takes so much.   I know I'm probably not getting much sympathy from you but I can try.Can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week.   Bet you are glad your kids are almost out of school.   Can't understand how these kids have access to all of these guns.   It's scary.Deb and I had lunch with Julia.   She's gone from Enron now.   She did not give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense.   Her family still does not know she is married.   She is being really strange about this whole thing. She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married.   I've given up on her.   She is almost as strange as you at times.   Luckily I have not given up on you .Going to Grand Cayman Islands on Thursday-plan on feeding the stingrays on Friday-will tell you all about it.Tell me why you are too busy to fill me in on what is happenign in your life.\n"

The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.   It just felt like Christmas.   We took a   carriage ride around Central Park and they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.   Met one of my contacts at Prebon for lunch and he   paid for it. .   Good   thing because we were drinking mimosas at $10.000 a pop.   We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion King.   Excellent. Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever seen.   The music was awesome.   Lion King had great special effects with all of the costumes. The people were dressed like animals and it was really cool.   Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz. level.   In other words-perfect seats.   On Saturday, we mostly shopped during the day.   Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring   and red leathe coat. You can't believe the people that were shopping.   We went to FAO Schwartz early-9:000 a.m.-and at 3:000 the line was clear around the building to get in.   The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.   You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.   I have never seen so many mink coats in my life.   Everyone had one on.   The hotel we stayed at was excellent.   It didn't have the view you did.   Nothing will ever match that.   But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and nicely decorated.   All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one hour.   We ate at some good restaurants too.   The first night was this small Italian restaurant.   Very authentic.   They took good care of us.   The second night was Thai-food was excellent.   The third day was French.   YUM YUM.   We got out of town just in time.   We really lucked out.   I would go back agai n if the right opportunity came up.\n"
