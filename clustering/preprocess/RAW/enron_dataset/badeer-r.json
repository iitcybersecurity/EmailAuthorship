Still, those companies that own generation in the state say theywelcome the probe into the power market by Attorney General Bill Lockyer.\"We have done nothing wrong at all,\" said Tom Williams, spokesman for DukeEnergy North America (DUK). \"Our plants have been running all summer long.Prices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billion in newgeneration and then try and rig the market.\"   For the past two months,utilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made allegationsthat generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible forthe price spikes.   Locker's office said an investigation is still pending.State regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findingsof which will be submitted to the governor and the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission by the end of the year.   Allegations Said Unsubstantiated   Thereisn't a shred of evidence to support allegations, said Severing Borenstein,director of the University of California, Berkley's, Energy Institute.\"There are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price forpower,\" Borenstein said. \"Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in thecommodities market to find a loophole and take advantage of the rules.   \"Iwould say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge highprices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. Thereis no sort of collusion that would interest the justice department ... .\"The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as aconsequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to paymarket-based rates for electricity.   The high wholesale costs paid byutility San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passedon to ratepayers and resulted in utility bills more than doubling.   Gov.Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their owninvestigation as well.   Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also saysthat an investigation \"will turn up nothing.\"   So why conduct one?   \"This isa very politically charged issue,\" Bergstrom said. \"When something goeswrong you have to find someone to point the finger at.\"   A source in thegovernor's office said Davis is aware that Attorney General Lockyer'sinvestigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis \"has a responsibility tohis constituents.\"   Supply vs. Demand   What the investigation will turn upis evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enoughpower plants being built to meet increasing demand, said Terry Winter,chairman and chief executive officer of the California Independent SystemOperator.   Winter said he doesn't believe that there is anything wrong withthe way generators sell their power and 98% of the time the market workswell.   \"Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawatt-hour)knowing that you're 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that asmarket power abuse,\" Winter said.   Despite some proposed regulatory changes,such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeze for SDG&amp;Ecustomers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) allstill plan to invest in generation in the state.   That's a different stancethan the companies took a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale pricecap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.   \"At the end of the day the marketis short power and you got to get people to build new generation,\" saidDynegy's Bergstrom. \"We got a big investment in California. We're notwalking away from that.\"   -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp;Company Inc12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers'Complaint(This article was originally published Tuesday)WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)---California's power grid administrator Monday urgedfederal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seekingcompensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtailedduring an extreme power grid emergency.The independent system operator told the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission that the power producers seek compensation in the event of a\"situation that never has occurred any time since the ISO began operations,and if it were to occur in the future, would do so rarely.\"The ISO noted that its tariff governing access to the state's grid alreadyallows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried thepower producers' complaint as \"a collateral attack\" on a previous FERC orderrejecting claims that the tariff failed to provide adequate compensation.Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resortmeasure taken only after other options have been exhausted, the ISO said.The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk ofinterruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.The ISO's objections were echoed by the state's electricity distributionutilities and California regulators.They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out fromunder the price controls the ISO has imposed in an effort to rein inskyrocketing power prices this summer.The generators \"knew when they purchased California power plants and whenthey entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter theirschedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commission to make it evenmore expensive, and hence, more difficult, for the ISO to maintain gridreliability in California is irresponsible,\" said Southern CaliforniaEdison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).\"The complaint is a sham,\" declared the California Public UtilitiesCommission.\"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps bymaking sales to affiliates or cooperating entities located out of state, andsell the power back to the ISO at uncapped prices reflecting the generators'market power,\" the PUC said, calling for FERC to summarily reject thecomplaint.\"The complaint is factually unsupported, legally unfounded, complains ofconduct consistent with the ISO's authority under pertinent FERC decisions,and seeks to avoid the price cap,\" the PUC said.But power marketers and other power producers voiced support for thecomplaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy PowerMarketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).\"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase priceof $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on sellers, the Cal ISOwould be overtly discriminating against export transactions and marketparticipants who schedule energy for export,\" said the Electric Power SupplyAssociation, the national trade group representing competitive powerproducers.\"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that thecurtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO will be compensated,\"said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.\"Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports will occurmore frequently. Less energy will be imported into California and moreenergy will leave California in search of higher prices,\" said WilliamsEnergy Marketing &amp; Trading Co. in support of the complaint's call for actualdamages and lost opportunity costs.At least one power purchaser voiced support for the producers' position aswell.\"It seems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert thetransactions of others to meet its own loads, that is should pay the fullcosts of doing so,\" said the Northern California Power Agency.-By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-66647; bryan.lee@dowjones.comCopyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company IncG_nther A.

NOUNINSTRUCTED DEVIATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED.   Section 2.3.1.2.1 of the ISOTariff requires Market Participants in the ISO Control Area to \"comply fullyand promptly with the ISO's operating orders.\" Any Generating Unit with realtime output that reflects an excessive deviation from the real time outputconsistent with its Final Hour Ahead Schedule as adjusted by Dispatchinstructions, and assuming a 20 minute ramp across the top of the hour forhourly Schedule changes, will be deemed to have failed to comply with thisoperating order.   For the purpose of this determination, an excessivedeviation shall be the smaller of 10% of a Generating Unit's maximumcapability, or 10 MW.   The only exception to this finding is a GeneratingUnit that provides the ISO with timely notification of a unit outage orderate. Failure to comply with this operating order threatens the reliableoperation of the ISO Control Area.   In particular, uninstructed incrementaldeviations by Generating Units that are \"chasing\" the BEEP Interval Pricespublished by the ISO are directly responsible for the frequency excursionsthe ISO experienced   June 13, 2000. The ISO will take the following actionswith respect to those Generating Units that fail to comply with thisOperating Order: 1) ISO Management will deliver a report to the ISOGoverning Board that provides a copy of this notice, and a comparison of theinstructed and actual output profile for each Generating Unit that fails tocomply. 2) The ISO will assign any WSCC RMS penalties associated withfrequency deviations to the Generating Units that fail to comply.\n"

He's responsible for the entire concept of Killer Tomatoes! Like everyone else here, he played small parts throughout the films.

PUC Approves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPX 17:46 GMT   8 June 2000 *DJ Calif. PUC Approves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPX Mandatory Buy Requirement Ends For Utilities LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)---The California Public Utilities Commissionapproved a controversial plan Thursday morning that will allow the state's three investor-owned utilities to buy power outsidethe Caliifornia Power Exchange market structure. The commission voted 3 to 2 in favor of the measure. Commissioners HenryDuque, Richard A. Bilas and Josiah Neeper voted in favor of the draft order. The decision relieves the three investor-owned utilities, Sempra Energyunit San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SRE), Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) and Edison International unit Southern California Edison(EIX), from their mandatory buy requirement that became effective in March 19998 when the state moved to a deregulatedcompetitive market. Originally the mandatory buy requirement was set to end in 20002, when all three utilities recoveredtheir stranded costs. \"This decision is not as earth shattering as it sounds,\" CommissionerBilas, one of the author's of the draft order, said at Thursday's meeting. \"I am not criticizing the power exchange. But this willresult in lower prices patched through to bundled customers.\" Trading platforms likw Automated Power Exchange and the New York MercantileExchange can now compete directly with the CalPX, which currently controls 85% of the state's wholesale power market.The utilities can buy power from other \"qualified exchanges\" through an advice letter process. Utilities Can Trade With Other Exchanges Now California's big three utilities can buy power outside the CalPX marketstructure immediately, through an advice letter process, which means the utilities have to notify the commission of their intent totrade power with qualified exchanges such as APX, Nymex or Bloomberg. The commission said the exchanges have to offer the same services as theCalPX - forward, daily and monthly trading, and anonymity to prevent self dealing between the buy side and sell side - inorder to meet the criteria for a qualified exchange. Exchanges would also have to be independently owned from the utilities.Enron Online would not meet the criteria for a qualified exchange, commissioners said. The advice letter only needs to be filed once and s merely a formality thatwould not need to be approved by a majority of the commission. Mark Huffman, PG&amp;E senior attorney for regulatory affairs, told Dow JonesNewswires that his company \"will quickly start looking at other exchanges and see what's out there. We're going to startthe advice letter process.\" SoCal Edison and SDG&amp;E said they will do the same. Ed Cazalet, chairman and founder of APX, said Thursday's controversialthree-to-two vote in favor of the draft order \"creates a tremendous opportunity for APX.\" \"It allows us to bring the benefits of Silicon Valley technology toCalifornia,\" Cazalet said. \"This is really about bringing e-commerce to the market.\" E. Jesus Arredondo, however, disagreed, saying \"selling into our marketdoesn't cost anything and selling into the APX market costs 20 cents per megawatt-hour.\" Commissioner said having other exchanges will not only result in lowerelectricity prices, but it will allow the buyer and seller the chance to see prices before making the purchase. CalPX's block forward prices are not immediately published, CommissionerBilas said. Reacting to the ruling, CalPX Chief Executive Officer George Sladoje said\"Today's split vote by the CPUC in favor of accelerating the introduction of other qualified exchanges is notwell-reasoned and it may in the end prove counterproductive.\" -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires (323) 658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company IncG_nther A.
