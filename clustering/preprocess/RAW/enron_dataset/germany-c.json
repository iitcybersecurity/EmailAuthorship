This Saturday, April 15th at 7:30 pm, I will have my first official party to put the first beer stains on the new home.   Let's keep this pretty simple and painless, everybody just needs to bring a little something to drink and I will provide the rest.   I will have directions sitting on my desk to figure out how to get to Pearland, for all you inside the loop people don't be afraid, it's not that difficult and long of a drive.   If you have any questions let me know and please pass this on to anybody I may have left off the list.Hope to see you all Saturday,MattDirections:Take 2888 S to the Pearland exit (CR 518) and take a left off the exit (going east).   You will stay on 518 for 1.2 miles.   After you come upon your third stop light you will make a right, this will be CR 90 ( there will be a strip mall on your right with a Domino's Pizza on the corner).   Travel on 90 for 1.8 miles until you dead end.   This will take you to CR 101, which you will take a left on.   Stay on CR 101 for 0.4 miles until you see Kennedy Rd and take a left.   My house is the first house on your left-hand side once you turn onto Kennedy.   3606 Kennedy Drive   281-692-92555\n"

As part of that Docket, several transmission lines were denied to gathering.   On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-0001, granting reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.   The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-199921, LN-943, H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.   On March 222, 2000, CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective April 1, 2000.   Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.   If you have questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at (304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.April 3, 2000   Received 4/3/000   111:10 am   Posted 4/3/000   111:10 amDear Pool Operator: CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.   This requires that the \"wet gas\" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.   The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.   Normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.   All questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area. Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:000 p.m. on Monday, September 111, 2000.   This will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.   As per CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:000 p.m. will result in CNGT considering the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool. As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in.   CNGT will not notify producers individually. We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.   I also wanted to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year.   The next regularly scheduled shut   down will not be until 20002. If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to contact me at (304) 623-8698.   Sincerely,   Nancy M.

Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on thedirectly assigned storage services for the rest February.   We don't want gasinjected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David willcontact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals.To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut backon flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA   per ourcontract.Please call me if you have questions, etc.Thanks.Doug KinneyPh:   703-561-63339Fax:   703-561-7317\n"

Technology has helped Enron create new=20\rbusinesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20\rresponsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.   You=\r=01,ve=20\rseen what technology can do at work.   Now we want you and your family to=20\rrealize its benefits at home.\r With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\rhe=20\rClickAtHome\rprogram, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20\rtechnology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=\r=20\rclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\r=20\rInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\r We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\r=20\rthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\r=20\rcase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\r=20\rcomputer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20\rClickAtHome includes the following:\r ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=\r=20\rdisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\r=20\rsoftware. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\r=20\rconnection, including broadband, where commercially available.\r? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\r=20\rand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\r=20\rhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\r,=20\rEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\raccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.   Eligibility includes being=20\remployed at the time of implementation. =20\r? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 20001, with delivery of=\r=20\rthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.   Delive=\rry=20\rof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 20001.\r Details about this program are still being finalized.   To address some of=\r=20\ryour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\r=20\rhttp:///clickathome.enron.com.   We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=\rar=20\rfuture where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20\rsubmit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20\r We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20\rfamily.   We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=\rl=20\rby creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=\r=20\rthe broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=\r=20\rEnron is a great place to work.\r\n"

They're sitting in a pub when he says to her&lt; &lt;\"Do you remember the first time we had sex together,&lt; &lt;over fifty years ago? We went behind the bar.   You&lt; &lt;leaned against the fence and I made love to you from&lt; &lt;behind.\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Yes, she say, \"I remember it well.\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;\"OK,\" he says, \"How about taking a stroll round there&lt; &lt;again and we can do it for old times sake?\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;\"Ooh Henry, you devil, that sounds like a good idea\",&lt; &lt;she answers.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;There's a man sitting at the next table listening to&lt; &lt;all this, having a chuckle to himself.   He thinks,&lt; &lt;\"I've got to see this, two old timers having sex&lt; &lt;against a fence.   So he follows them.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;They walk haltingly along, leaning on each other for&lt; &lt;support, aided by walking sticks.   Finally they get to&lt; &lt;the back of the bar and make their way to the fence.&lt; &lt;The old lady lifts her skirt, takes her knickers down&lt; &lt;and the old man drops his trousers.   She turns around&lt; &lt;and as she hangs on to the fence, the old man moves&lt; &lt;in.   Suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex the&lt; &lt;watching man has ever seen.   They are bucking and&lt; &lt;jumping like eighteen-year-olds.   This goes on for&lt; &lt;about forty minutes.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;She's yelling \"Ohh God!\" He's hanging on to her hips&lt; &lt;for dear life.   This is the most athletic sex&lt; &lt;imaginable.   Finally, they both collapse panting on&lt; &lt;the ground.   The guy watching is amazed.   He thinks he&lt; &lt;has learned something about life that he didn't know.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;After about half an hour of lying on the ground&lt; &lt;recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and&lt; &lt;put their clothes back on.   The guy, still watching&lt; &lt;thinks, 'That is amazing, he was going like a train.&lt; &lt;I've got to ask him what his secret is.'&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;As the couple pass, the guy says to them, \"That was&lt; &lt;something else, you must have been shagging for about&lt; &lt;forty minutes.   How do you manage it?   Is there some&lt; &lt;sort of secret?\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;\"No, there's no secret\", the old man says, \"except&lt; &lt;fifty years ago that fucking fence wasn't electric.\"&lt; \n"

There are three   worksheets labelled asfollows:'Total Reqs':   Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at eachof the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled \"NOM\".   TheEnron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed ata specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored untilfurther notice.   CES schedulers note:   the attached file is archived onP:\\Energy Ops\\Enron\\May_000\\Daily\\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicatecopy elsewhere on the network.'Daily Change' :   shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volumeneeded from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to thesupply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.   Forthe current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated usingthe previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gasday is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for3/28.   Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was infact effectuated).   For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, thechange is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less theFirst-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since thefirst-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.   (e.g., Iftoday is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect tothe first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additionalpurchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheetshould be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that wetake or turn back.   The column labelled \"ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA atpre-specified prices.   Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes orfor swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be negotiated.'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.Hans Herzogph: 703 561 63331fax: 703 561 7317 - 08-01-000 daily vols.xls\n"

For your information, Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and prices in it.   I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided to us by CES.   Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.   Anyway, there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in by your group (I think you're the right one).   Again, those deals should be on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.   In addition, I received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, showing their nominations for March---it will probably be a good idea to compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things are matching up.   I'll e-mail that list to you separately.If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please advise.\n"

As you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/000 (#65402); the other is to BG&amp;E   for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403).   This is the information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me---you need to confirm that this information is accurate.I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.   I think this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it up!!!).   If there is any problem with this, please let me know.\n"

When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,1333 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090.   When we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094.This may seem a little confusing.   Please call me if you still have questions.Thanks\n"

In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.   Below are the observations   that I have.   I would like to get you feedback on these.   If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.   As such, we will only interpret the language of the agreement related to \"existing markets\" as applying to only those twelve markets.   For other markets that we conduct business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the agreement.   In essence, we see the supply management agreement being bi-furcated since CES is selling C&amp;I to another marketer.2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.   This would include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.   In addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.   It would also include the following transportation agreements: 618222, 61825, 61838, 619990, 64939, 65418, 62164.   There are some capacity agreements on TCO for CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&amp;I and mass markets.   It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .   All un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&amp;I agreements.3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 20001.   I want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.   I will need your viewpoint on this.   If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our ability to market any excess capacity in open market.   Bottom-line, I want to avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for un-utilized capacity. 4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.   My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar nature and service level. (supply management)   To the degree that New Power chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only transactions would not be subject to this clause.   I know you will need to review the contract.   We have some time to discuss these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next Friday, if at all possible.   I can be reached at ext 39475.   Thanks for your help.   \n"

The \"2000ces02.xls\" file is where Goodell and I keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport pricing.   There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.   I use the data in this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.   It is a completly manual process.I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the pricing (excellent performance review stuff).   I do want to go over the data in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.Thanks.---"

From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand charge of $.02/mmmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.Which brings up 2 important points; 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss this with CALP (and she may have already)   However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May. 2.

In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.   We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:   For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:000 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station.   The Dominion \"bubbles\" affected are 44404 &amp; 44405.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.   The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.   Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering &amp; Production Office.   The application must indicate the amount of \"incremental\" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.   We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.   In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.   Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.   Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).Forward this information to:   Joseph A. Thompson   Manager, Business Development   Dominion TransmissionGathering &amp; Production Division   5000 Davisson Run Road   Clarksburg, WV   26301After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.   You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.   Please realize that this is a \"window\" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23, 2000.I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.   You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression   \"open season\" request on Dominion Gathering.Sincerely, H.

According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering about 111,000 dt to these 4 delivery points.Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie.1.   Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.   At today's prices we save:   Savings Tenn Variable $.0491   at $3.000 CNG Fuel $.0672   at   $2.888   --- Total Savings $.11151   At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.111000, we should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie2.   Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.   We save the CNG fuel cost.   This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of $.04 to $.06. Last year, CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer.\n"

We heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.   Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until: 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or,   2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and   processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.   We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.   If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.   Sincerely,   H. Dale Rexrode   Director, Producer Services   and Business Development\n"

FYI   May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m. Dear West Virginia Producer,Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providingadditional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovativeprojects and joint ventures.   In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into ourgathering system may be approved.   We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:000 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications forcompression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.   The Dominion \"bubbles\" affected are 3219, 32223 and 32224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 3218, 32220, 32221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 32111, 3212 and 3213for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.   The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreementswill not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existingcompressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.   Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering &amp; Production Office.   The application must indicate the amount of \"incremental\" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacitywill be forfeited.   In the event that more requests for compression rights forincremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposedlocation where you will be requesting to install compression.   Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.   Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).Forward this information to:   Joseph A. Thompson   Manager, Business Development   Dominion Transmission   Gathering &amp; Production Division   5000 Davisson Run Road   Clarksburg, WV   26301After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and thecapacity requests.   You will be contacted as soon as possible afterJune 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. Please realize that this is a \"window\" and the opportunity will close afterNoon on June 12, 2000.I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on thisopportunity to add compression.

Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-88854 and ask for fuel waivers on contract 5A25000 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 411101) to the following metersNIMO East 205550, NIMO West 205000, East Ohio 201000, NYSEG 207000, RG&amp;E 206000, and Hanley &amp; Bird 2111000.

There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, time frame and the critical nature of   the notices.   The cost is based on the number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months the cost would be approximately $3,000.   If you would like to check it out   I have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 111/5/000).   Click here http:///www.capacitycenter.com/   the login name is sboyle@enron.com and password is jackd.   Let me know if you would like an overview or see any reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.

There should have been a message in Columbia Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your IPP pool 37147 effective 4/2000.   The subject for this e-mail message was \"Appalachian Meter Allocation\".   The meters listed in this e-mail will now be on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25 gathering rate.   Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000 SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission to Gatherco.   He said he is not 1000% positive that they will get this finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time they release our nominations.Gloria and Wade,You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these meters.   Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's $.27 gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any gathering.   Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.Please call me if you have any questions.Thanks,Heidi Griffith\n"

This volume fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.   This deal also goes through October.We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.   I did not see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to be corrected.   This deal goes through November.

According to my new best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the January transaction is complete.Here are my questions/comments;1.   David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 1467888).   The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.   I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.   If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the new deal.   Please let me know ASAP.2.   Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?   I would like to see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment was due.3.   David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?4.   Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES deals.

A king size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2,000 sq   foot&lt; house 4 inches deep.&lt; 2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with&lt; roller blades, they can ignite,&lt; 3. A 3-year-old's voice is louder than 2000 adults in a crowded&lt; restaurant.&lt; 4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan, the motor is not strong&lt; enough to rotate a 42 pound boy wearing Batman underwear and a superman&lt; cape. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of a&lt; 20X20 foot room.&lt; 5. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on.&lt; When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up a few&lt; times before you get a hit. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long way.&lt; 6. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn't stop a baseball hit&lt; by a ceiling fan.&lt; 7. When you hear the toliet flush and the words \"Uh-oh\", it's already&lt; too late.&lt; 8. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke, and lots of it.&lt; 9. A six-year-old can start a fire with a flint rock even though a&lt; 36-year-old man says they can only do it in the movies. A magnifing glass&lt; can start a fire even on an overcast day.&lt; 10. Certain Lego's will pass through the digestive tract of a&lt; four-year-old.&lt; 111. Play Dough and Microwave should never be used in the same sentence.&lt; 12. Super glue is forever.&lt; 13. No matter how much Jell-O you put in a swimming pool you still can't&lt; walk on water.&lt; 14. Pool filters do not like Jell-O.&lt; 15. VCR's do not eject PB&amp;J sandwiches even though TV commercials show&lt; they do.&lt; 16. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.&lt; 17. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.&lt; 18. You probably do not want to know what that odor is.&lt; 19. Always look in the oven before you turn it on. Plastic toys do not&lt; like ovens.&lt; 20. The fire department in Austin has a 5 minute response time.&lt; 21. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earth worms&lt; dizzy.&lt; It will however make cats dizzy and cats throw up twice their body weight&lt; when dizzy.&lt;&lt;\n"

Technically, today'saction appears corrective in nature leaving the door open forsideways too lower prices on Friday. It will take closes abovetrendline resistance crossing near 10,760 to temper the near-termbearish outlook in the Dow.JUNE BONDS closed higher on Thursday following today's release offriendly retail sales data. This week's rebound off the 62%retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 92-31 has allowedJune to challenging initial trendline resistance crossing near 94-09.Multiple closes above this resistance level would signal a minor lowmight be in place.http:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/USM0-daily.htmlCRB INDEX surged to new highs for the second day in a row confirmingWednesday's trading range breakout above 217.888. Sharp gains inenergies supported today's rally in the CRB, which has renewed itslong-term uptrend. I would not be surprised to see the CRB tradesideways too lower on Friday as it consolidates some of this week'sgains and possibly retest broken resistance at 217.888. However, thisweek's move to new highs has opened the door for a possible test ofweekly resistance at 2223.23 later this month.http:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/NYCE/CRY0-daily.htmlCURRENCIES the June Dollar closed higher on Thursday followingWednesday's late-session turnaround. The setback off last week's lowas the appearance of a potential bull flag.

The Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower onThursday with the D-mark gapping down and closing below long-termsupport at .4624. Closes below last week's lows in both markets areneeded to renew this spring's declines. The June Japanese Yen posteda key reversal up after session lows fell short of the Feb. low at.9125. Additional gains on Friday would confirm today's reversalpattern however; June needs to close above .9394 to confirm ashort-term bottom has likely been posted.http:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/NYCE/DXM0-daily.htmlhttp:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/SFM0-daily.htmlhttp:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/DMM0-daily.htmlhttp:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/ECM0-daily.htmlhttp:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/JYM0-daily.htmlPRECIOUS METALS closed mixed on Thursday.

Julycorn posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close as tradersdigested Wednesday's bullish long-range weather forecast from NOAA.Light consolidation ahead of Friday's supply/demand report alsolimited today's gains.

July wheat gapped up and closed sharply higher for thesecond day in a row due to strong fund related buying. Expectationsfor a friendly supply/demand report on Friday and bullish weatherforecast have been the driving factors behind this week's rally.Today's close above minor resistance at 2.78 1/2 makes March's highat 2.84 July's next target, then this winter's high at 2.95 1/2.

July beans posted an inside day inrelatively quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's reports. Never the less,this week's rally is turning a number of short-term momentumindicators neutral too bullish leaving July poised to renew thisyear's rally if the weather turns hot and dry next week. Closes above5.82 1/2 would confirm the uptrend has resumed. July soybean mealspiked to new highs before light profit taking tempered today'smeager gain. Today's high-range close leaves July poised to extendthis month's move to new highs if Friday's reports come in neutral tofriendly. July bean oil closed lower on Thursday in narrow trading asthe market remains poised to extend its decline off May's high shouldFriday's reports come in neutral to bearish. Today's bearish exportsales report does not bode well for the longer-term outlook in beanoil. If the decline resumes, the 50% retracement level of thisspring's rally at 17.50 is July's next target.http:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/SN0-daily.htmlhttp:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/SMN0-daily.htmlhttp:///www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/BON0-daily.htmlLIVESTOCK closed lower on Thursday pressured by weaker cash andproduct prices.

Transco Files Motion For Modification of Settlement September 222, 2000 To:? Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and Shippers Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to ??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds ??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000 In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion, Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the January 20, 19998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate the effects of current high natural gas prices on their customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets. Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to those customers with interest from the date of payment to the date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 19997 through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No. RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues, subject to the \"refund floor\". These interim partial refunds will be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon request. If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non- Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in the interim partial refunds.

If God meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body. 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me. 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them. 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier. 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country. 10) I don't jog.

She's 97 now &amp; we don't know where the hell she is. 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so that I could hear heavy breathing again. 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 4000 bucks. Haven't lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up. 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what I'm doing. 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body. 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me. 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them. 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier. 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country. 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of my glass.\n"

The Junecontract climbed$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The marketwas basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storageinjection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce anaddition to storage of about 1000 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could sparka rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.However, an injection of over 1115 Bcf could send the market to $4.000 in ahurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-yearaverage injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, thehighest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 19998. If current weather models hold up,the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look fortechnical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped$0.10   $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot pricesrose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hubdropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.___25TH Annual CIS ConferenceMay 15-18, 20001Albuquerque, NMThe CIS Conference provides utility management personnel unequaled insightand current information on customer relationship management (CRM),e-commerce, technologies and marketing.

Lay spoke after receiving the US EnergyAssociation's 20001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have openaccess to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the Westif we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power gridthroughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series ofseparate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also saysFERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way thatnatural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested inenergy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take afew years to correct that.___And now there's FASB 1333.

Last week the governor said he wouldseek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions ofdollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigationinto alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discusslimits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it isprepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through thesummer of 20002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possiblealternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiteratean earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if thebuyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy hasproposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state inreturn for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices theycharged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, andWilliams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.___GasTrader.NetBULLS CAUTIOUSIn spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiouslybullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish causewith the prospects of hot summer weather looming.\"This is a weak market, butI think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrialdemand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edgeoff the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gonethrough a major change. Production has increased, storage   is higher, andthe injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 19998,' saysGeorge Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. \"I was skeptical of the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when youcombine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balancebecomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wildcard is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. Ifprices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chanceprices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be anaggressive seller,\" he said.For a Complimentary 5 week GasTrader Subscription go tohttp:///www.gastrader.net or call 303/761-7470___TRENTON/BLACKRIVER \"BOOM\" IN WEST VIRGINIALand and Mineral Development LLC., Vienna, West Virginia, owns 85,000 acresof mineral rights in Southeastern West Virginia.

TheCalifornia ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 4000 MW.Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with theheat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line formaintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excludedfrom the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has morethan enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was runningabout 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projectedblackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two5000-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flowsouth. About 7000 MW produced by small suppliers, known as QualifyingFacilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hottemperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of moreblackouts.___CAMINUSENERGY SOFTWARESHOWCASE 20001HOUSTON, TEXASYou're InvitedTo a four hour exposition of software and services that will set the newstandard for the energy trading, scheduling, and risk management.

Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.   This deal will be matched with the CPA local production deals.Let me know if anyone has any questions.Thankscg 3-4743---"

Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their&lt; heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.   There are things&lt; you'd love to hear that you would never hear from the person whom you&lt; would like to hear them from, but don't be so deaf as not to hear it from&lt; the one who says it from his heart.&lt;&lt; Never say good-bye if you still want to try&lt; never give up if you still feel you can go on&lt; never say you don't love a person anymore if you can't let go&lt; Love comes to those who still hope&lt; although they've been disappointed,&lt; There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that   you just&lt; want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real!

Phase II begins 111/1/02.   The rates shown are for the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the project.   Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power commodity charge and ACA.   There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity surcharges.   The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY points.   The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are non-NY. Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 1000,000 Dthd.   Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden allocation point.   Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the Trenton-Woodbury line.   Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.   Statoil has also sold another project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.   The new and unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.   Sunset Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,6000 Dthd precedent agreement.   LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.   PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania on a primary basis.   They also have the right to extend their agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.   Dynegy (30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent agreements.   Due to these terminations and reductions,   Transco only has announced precedent agreements of 190,6000 Dthd for later phases.   If these precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,6000 Dthd of shipper volume.   Transco has stated that all 7000,000 Dthd of MarketLink would be built by 111/01/04.\n"

Earlier today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any longer.   Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TT Contracts) for their daily business.   Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a lot of business through them.   Ken is now interested in doing some negotiating.   As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied to the seller only.   Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their customer list.   Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process confidential in the best interests of both parties.   If you have any other questions about this conversation, please let me know. Scott-   Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   Just as a side note:   Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing a hub service for Transco right now. Thanks!   -Angie   \n"

Transco gave me the receipt volumes in MCF's and I used a 1.035 Btu factor.   I can't Point   Volume MCF   dts Henry   12,3336   12,768Mamou   7,849   8,124Carthage 4,934   5,107Ada   7,401   7,6660   (at the east end on the north LA lateral leg in TGT Zone 1)   Total   333,659My numbers must be off a little somewhere because NYPA's MDQ is 30,840 dts, grossed up for fuel of 7.62%, the receipt volume is 333,384 dts.   To my knowledge, we have never used ADA (which I know nothing about) or Carthage.Currently we are giving NYPA half their volume at Mamou (off TGT) and half at Henry.   At the very least we should be able to switch these volumes around to better suit our needs.Please note, I have not mentioned any of this to Stacey at NYPA.   The only information Stacey was able to provide was her delivered MDQ and her grossed up receipt volume.   She relies on us to tell her how much gas she is getting at each point.\n"

National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract.   We are now long FSS and short PALS. FSS We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 333,333 dth per day.   However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 333,333 dth on any given day.   Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like Trco-Leidy.   We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.   IASWe give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel is still setting up the contracts).   We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any point we wish.   We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the FSS.   And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.COSTWhat we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.   ENA will pay Nat Fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, and August.   This deal is over on Aug 31st.   I just entered the demand charge on my Market East demand charge sheet.   I do not have any deals set up in Sitara.   I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.   I will keep track of the balances on an Excel worksheet.   All commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.125 demand charge.   Beavy and I will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.   If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced.Payback TechniquesUnder the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.   Nat Fuel has been very close to capacity this week.   However, we should always see what Martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.   OR if Niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at today's prices that cost about $.105Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and payback the gas at Leidy.   At today's prices, that cost about   $.0555, assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).   We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on segmented capacity for $.145 or   move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.111.   We cannot use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.Let me know if you have any questons.\n"

The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.   It will cost $1000 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.   If Paul Leanza can use the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool (309/Day).   The Power Gas volumes go through October.John\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nHere is what I'm looking at for July 1.   Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.   I don't know if that's dt or mcf.   I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.   This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.   For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.   I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.   But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.   Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.   Marde will not sell at that price but I will.Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.   Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.   What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 3000 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.   It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.   Comments / Questions?QuestionsJohn1.   Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.   Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?   If yes, how many meters?2.   Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples   Phillips   Power Gas MarketingTermPriceVolumeHeidi (EES)If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.   Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.MardeI would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.   At what price will you take these deals?   I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this.---"

Chris and I usually handle the capacity so we wanted to touch base with you before August business begins.Are you keeping the CES entity for the month of August or switching to TNPC?   If you don't switch for August, when do you expect the name change to occur?If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual.   If you switch, keep in mind:For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the party responsible for billing Choice customers.   For July- Columbia Maryland, Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes.   This would refund the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transport charges and bill CES direct.   Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas for this?   If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have agency rights.   If not, call Erin Scott at 713-267-4212 to set up your business party.For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless told otherwise.   Releases begin 7/19 for August allocations.I will be out of the office 7/13, returning 7/21, so call Chris with any questions.Scott\n"

Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my&lt;boss,&lt;and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business.\"&lt;&lt;   A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily&lt;together during negotiations.   According to the company, \"The deal fits&lt;both&lt;companies exceptionally well.   With Hades' ability to attract and&lt;retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for&lt;millennia to come.\"   According to several energy industry insiders, Hades'&lt;high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make&lt;it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.&lt;&lt;Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and&lt;approximately 173 quintillion customers.   The entity boasts sustained high&lt;growth rates over the last two thousand years.&lt;&lt;   Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.&lt;The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications&lt;assets.   Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's \"Best 1000 Companies to&lt;Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A&lt;Week,\" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked&lt;by&lt;customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply&lt;contracts.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.comPG&amp;E National Energy Group and any othercompany referenced herein that uses the PG&amp;E name orlogo are not the same company as Pacific Gas andElectric Company, the regulated California utility.

Both groups were asked to give four reasons for their recommendations.   The group of women concluded that computers should be referred to as masculine because: 1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on. 2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 3. They are supposed to help you solve your problems, but half the time, they ARE the problem. 4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, if you had waited a little longer, you could have had a better model.   The men, on the other hand, decided that computers should definitely be referred to as feminine because: 1. No one but their creator understands their internal logic. 2. The native language they use to communicate with other computers is incomprehensible to everyone else. 3.   Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory for later retrieval. 4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself spending half your paycheck on accessories for it. \n"

It was under the dresser in his bed room.I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.   It iscaptured in a pistol storage case.   I stuck it in behind the sheets andthings.   I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.   They are a great couple.Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.   I am goingto get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if hewants to lease Dad's pasture.As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.   You had said we do not want topay for a fence along the creek.   When I have leased places in the past Ihave had to build new fence at my own expense.   Most folk's base theircow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.   If I built fenceand that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,excluding my labor.   Something to think about.   I hope we do not own thatplace for five more years.   Gerald also said he would mow the grass aroundthe house and sort of keep the place tuned up.Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.   They placed her inAngleton/Danbury for overnight observation.   I think she required aboutseven stitches in her head.   There were x-rays taken and her lungs arepretty much gone.   Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech canread his prints.Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.   Now where did they come up with a name likethat?   They removed the lymph glands from his neck.   Starting down the torsojust at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down thetorso about six or seven inches.   A triangle shape about the size of a pieceof large pizza.   The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep intohis body.   The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.   They took a prettybig chunk out of his chest.   He had a six \" x eight \" piece of skin removedfrom his left thing for a skin graft.   It looked pretty painful.   He was ingood spirits and bull corning around.I guess that is about it.   I would like to have a timber appraisal performedon the Dad's place.   I'll be chatting with you guys.   Oh, I forgot the dangremote to the TV.   I really was not for sure which one it was.   I think Ineed it to program the darn thing.   Keep your powder dry.Y'all be safe,donDowW.

I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask himabout a boat.   Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat?   Freshwater orSaltwater.   I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha.   A friend of mineat Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down BostonWhaler.   I think the boat was around 21/23 '.   The sides were approximately6/8\" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directlybehind that which served as a seat.   It also had what I call a jack plate onthe motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.   Hecould run in about 8\" of h2o.   If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150horse Yamaha.   That baby would fly.   They are bay boats but Aubrey took hisout in the Gulf frequently.   You should call Duane Davis.

The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment to a pipeline for a transportation related expense.   The Service Verification shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager, times a rate from   either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal ticket.   I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue.   Since we are noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for calculation of a payment.   Is there a different way to handle these types of contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager?   I've heard of something like a point nom as way to handle.   Are we doing that on this contract?   \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Victor Lamadrid   10/02/2000 08:12 PM To: Brenda H Fletcher/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Goodell/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alvin Thompson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Joann Collins/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Allegany contract on CGAS   Brenda, Please explain...What's a service verification and how can we fix this???Brenda H Fletcher09/222/2000 03:45 PMTo: Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Allegany contract on CGASWe are noming agent only on Contract 37982 but a Service Verification continues to be drafted in Settlements.

There are three   worksheets labelled asfollows:'Total Reqs':   Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at eachof the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled \"NOM\".   TheEnron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed ata specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored untilfurther notice.   CES schedulers note:   the attached file is archived onP:\\Energy Ops\\Enron\\April_000\\Daily\\ *.xls, so you don't have to save aduplicate copy elsewhere on the network.'Daily Change' :   shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volumeneeded from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to thesupply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.   Forthe current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated usingthe previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gasday is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for3/28.   Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was infact effectuated).   For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, thechange is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less theFirst-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since thefirst-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.   (e.g., Iftoday is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect tothe first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additionalpurchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheetshould be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that wetake or turn back.   The column labelled \"ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA atpre-specified prices.   Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes orfor swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be negotiated.'TCO Storage':   Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storageinjection for the month.   Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meetsome or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the\"Daily Change' worksheet.

For your information, Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and prices in it.   I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided to us by CES.   Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.   Anyway, there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in by your group (I think you're the right one).   Again, those deals should be on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.   In addition, I received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, showing their nominations for March---it will probably be a good idea to compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things are matching up.   I'll e-mail that list to you separately.If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please advise.\n"

You can do what you want, but I still think we should book it.   The flexibility in takes is only 10% so your flash to actual will not be that great---certainly less than if you don't book anything.   Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.   In addition, per our discussion with Retail---which Dick was in on that meeting---it is unlikely that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.   This would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.   And finally, what if Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time---we need the volume info in there.Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you want.   ---",

However, Enrondid not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it forthe 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.   When I ran myTCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet andthat she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I didnot find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I ranmy TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)to find out why.   She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after Icalled stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal wasonly for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it wasthrough the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms forSunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian thismorning to negotiate price.   I told her the price would have calculated lastweek.To make a long story short,   we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th(during and OFO/OMO).   Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.   Brian,expect a call from Chris this morning.\n"

In continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved.   We have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:   For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:000 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE compressor station.   The Dominion \"bubbles\" affected are 44404 &amp; 44405.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.   The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.   Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system.   Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering &amp; Production Office.   The application must indicate the amount of \"incremental\" gas for the specific compression agreement.   Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.   We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.   In the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression.   Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression agreement.   Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be included (please print or type).Forward this information to:   Joseph A. Thompson   Manager, Business Development   Dominion TransmissionGathering &amp; Production Division   5000 Davisson Run Road   Clarksburg, WV   26301After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the capacity requests.   You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.   Please realize that this is a \"window\" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 23, 2000.I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this opportunity to add compression.   You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding this compression   \"open season\" request on Dominion Gathering.Sincerely, H.

Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.   I'm assuming that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the Wholesale package.   If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours and are, presumably, CES Retail.   If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to Enron.   In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or not.

Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for CES?   This could be a can of worms. Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the official word.Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating.However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.   \tFrom:   Katherine L Kelly @ ECT   03/13/2000 10:34 AM To: Joan Veselack/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Wade R Price/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: CES Pool GasHey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are TCO deals.   I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.   We found a few like this on CNG last week.   The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.   Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right now he's priorities are just a bit different.   I guess why I'm a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.   Wade - Do you know whether deal 1426669 is pool or a citygate deal?   If it's pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in Navigator.Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?---",

Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the official word.Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany has been creating.However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.   \tFrom:   Katherine L Kelly @ ECT   03/13/2000 10:34 AM To: Joan Veselack/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Wade R Price/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: CES Pool GasHey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are TCO deals.   I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.   We found a few like this on CNG last week.   The way we have been handling this is to show a buy from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.   Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right now he's priorities are just a bit different.   I guess why I'm a little confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.   Wade - Do you know whether deal 1426669 is pool or a citygate deal?   If it's pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would have had to nominate it in Navigator.Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?---"

Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler   they would not be charged the title transfer fee.

Not a big deal for October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months.   I could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.Example:   You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your transport to get it to a citygate.   ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.   We should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on the worksheet.So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.Comments?\n"

EES has the ability to take this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).   I told Marde we would talk about that after the 4th.

However, we may be able to transfer any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.   Hopefully, we can talk about this after the 4th.Let me know if anyone has any questions.\n"

Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk P&amp;L.   I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.SummaryEarlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of $463,609.20.   This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.   ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated with this contract.   Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to corporate.   The net effect to ECT is $0.000.   Enron Corp is also expecting $127,000.000.   This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 19997 that was written off on 19998 (see below).   The actual amount for the 19997 adjustment is $121,080.16.   Enron Corp has had a $6000,000.000 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.   Enron Corp and Transcanada thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT. ---",

Tracy is expecting to receive about $590,000.000, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's meeting plus a $127,000.000 adjustment we processed   in mid to late 19997.Melba told me this morning that   the $127,000.000 was for a 9612 production month adjustment.   What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)   pass it through to some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3) cut a check to Trans Canada?   Who do I talk to about this?Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 3666.   Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.   Her extension is 3-77720.Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait until we find out what happened to the $127,000.000?   I believe it depends on how long it will take to research the $127,000.000.Comments, Questions?---",

This might be redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/000 that we were cut 364 MMBtu's (from 24,502 to 24,138) @ Canajoharie on the evening cycle of 06/26/000 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), &amp; the cut volume was placed into PALS.   As I understand it, the late notification was a trickle down, i.e. Beth @ CNG notified Iroquois on 07/26, &amp; Iroquois notified us when they found out.   Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, incurring parking charges of $173.777 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days = 111,284 MMBtu's @ $0.0154 = $173.777).   Per Angie's previous e:mail on this item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, &amp; this parking charge is related, &amp; so, may be disputable.   Either way, the volume's currently not in Unify as parked, &amp; will not show up on the Service Verification at present.   Are there any updates to the status on this item?

I think I know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany earlier this month.   I have not followed up with it since then, and that is my fault.   The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely notification by any means.   I think that Chris was looking into this issue with Colleen Sullivan, because of the late notification.   I will badger Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week after the dust has settled from the 1st.   Thanks for understanding.   -Angie\n"

CES has a term supply contract with Enron for 69000 delivered to Union Camp and this expires at the end of March 2000. CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to nominate this gas until the end of March 2000.The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency rights for the International Paper Contract. Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in 20002. Colleen and Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this contract to Alliance Energy. This is not allowed per the Contract language.In addition, Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required by TCO, because it is vague. Enron needs this agreement signed so we can nominate the gas under Enron's accounts on TCO. We need CES's help in getting this matter resolved ASAP.Thanks \n"

It was done as a physical fixed price deal and it goes through September.   The volume is 5,000 per month for April through August and 20,000 per month for September.CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.   The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 1 volumes.   So I created a sell (#22265553) to CES for the same volume at a   price of IF CGAS + $.00075.The deal numbers for March are 1575559 and 2052228.dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 08/03/2000 06:57:54 AMTo: \" - *Chris.Germany@enron.com\" &lt;Chris.Germany@enron.com&lt;cc: \" - *Simien, Ernie\" &lt;esimien@columbiaenergygroup.com&lt;, \" - *Destephanis, Kara\" &lt;kdestep@columbiaenergygroup.com&lt;, \" - *Contos, Richard\" &lt;rcontos@columbiaenergygroup.com&lt;, \" - *scott.goodell@enron.com\" &lt;scott.goodell@enron.com&lt; Subject: Invoice QuestionChris---There is a recurring set of monthly transactions on ENA's invoices thatI don't recognize.

Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement shipper.   Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not) about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.   For instance, they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy to complete within GISB timelines.Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on Iroquois' system?   Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments on this issue.

It was under the dresser in his bed room.I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.   It iscaptured in a pistol storage case.   I stuck it in behind the sheets andthings.   I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.   They are a great couple.Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.   I am goingto get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if hewants to lease Dad's pasture.As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.   You had said we do not want topay for a fence along the creek.   When I have leased places in the past Ihave had to build new fence at my own expense.   Most folk's base theircow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.   If I built fenceand that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,excluding my labor.   Something to think about.   I hope we do not own thatplace for five more years.   Gerald also said he would mow the grass aroundthe house and sort of keep the place tuned up.Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.   They placed her inAngleton/Danbury for overnight observation.   I think she required aboutseven stitches in her head.   There were x-rays taken and her lungs arepretty much gone.   Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech canread his prints.Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.   Now where did they come up with a name likethat?   They removed the lymph glands from his neck.   Starting down the torsojust at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down thetorso about six or seven inches.   A triangle shape about the size of a pieceof large pizza.   The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep intohis body.   The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.   They took a prettybig chunk out of his chest.   He had a six \" x eight \" piece of skin removedfrom his left thing for a skin graft.   It looked pretty painful.   He was ingood spirits and bull corning around.I guess that is about it.   I would like to have a timber appraisal performedon the Dad's place.   I'll be chatting with you guys.   Oh, I forgot the dangremote to the TV.   I really was not for sure which one it was.   I think Ineed it to program the darn thing.   Keep your powder dry.Y'all be safe,donDowW.

I am looking to turn over ourlocal production.   After August we won't be in business anymore and this localproduction that is in our name is really Enron North America's localproduction.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local aggpool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can turnthis production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to givethem formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identificationnumbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get thiscleared up and seem to have no luck.Thanks again for your help.cc:Subject:   Local Production July 000Hi Karen,Please nominate a volume of 24,8000 dth's for the month of July 000 for CES'local production.Please let me know if you need something more from me.   I understand thatClinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over ourlocal production.   I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the localproduction, is there a meter number or identification number that I will needto mention in the letter?Thanks,Heidi Boyd703-561-6496\n"

Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #2226563, as combine with the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #2226563 should have been entered with the CES prefix.John, can you fill in the missing details?CyndieChris Germany@ECT05/25/2000 04:19 PMTo: John M Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, David Oliver/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Allwein/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth L Hernandez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Molly Johnson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wade R Price/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Joan Veselack/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Joann Collins/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Local Production for JuneJohn, I took the volumes on deal 22265556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting June 1.   This is the purchase from Belden &amp; Blake behind NYSEG. I changed the volume on deal 2226563 from 1 dth/day to 15000 dth/day.   This is the purchase from StatOil at CPA.   The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).   John, is this price adjusted for dth???I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.   This is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.   David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.Cindy - deal 2226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.   I set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.   This deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.   According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - StatOil Energy.   It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 2226563.I changed the volume on deal 2226747 from 1 dth to 111000 dth/day.   This is a purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.   John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now.   Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.

Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.   I had requested 145 dth per day onDoug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.   For some reason ChrisGermany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.   PSNC calledme and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.   I instructed PSNC tocontact Chris.   Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth onthe first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.   I did this.This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.   I called my transco scheduler andshe told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.(impossible as capacity was released to Enron).   All I wanted was 145 dth perday for March.   Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what shouldand did get scheduled?   Thank you.\n"

Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd volume.Chris Germany@ECT06/20/2000 03:59 PMTo: John M Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marde L Driscoll/HOU/EEES@EES, Alain Diza/HOU/EEES@EES, Heidi Griffith/DUB/EEES@EEScc: Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: PeoplesHere is what I'm looking at for July 1.   Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.   I don't know if that's dt or mcf.   I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.   This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.   For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.   I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.   But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.   Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.   Marde will not sell at that price but I will.Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.   Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.   What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 3000 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.   It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.   Comments / Questions?QuestionsJohn1.   Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.   Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?   If yes, how many meters?2.   Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples   Phillips   Power Gas MarketingTermPriceVolumeHeidi (EES)If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.   Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.MardeI would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.   At what price will you take these deals?   I assume we need to get this info from John before you can anwser this.---"

But I need help understanding this one.   We have a process already to handle John's behind the citygate deals   Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,   we never nominate this gas nor do we see actuals.   We hear about them from John and Terry and we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.   Whenever one of these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to account for these transactions internally.It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the citygate deals;   that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.   The offset also entered by Terry   is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.   Angie schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. Is that not the case here?   Is this something that's getting reconciled in Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.   THANKS!

(Applause here!)   Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be handled via a manual line item.   Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.   For example, if you are correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.   Same applies to cashouts and commodity.All Service invoices for all production months through 111/1999 must be corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.   Any exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.   The Rates team will also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.   This should allow you time to redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we close with everything finaled.Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within Unify/Sitara.   Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and reversed by the end of the same accounting month.   For items that have been identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be provided to me at the end of the month.The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management coordinator.   They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production forward.   Upcoming goal --- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by the end of 2/2000 accounting...   Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.\n"

We have submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS &amp; SST) for the 000-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from 3/000, so 4/000 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.

Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.   However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.   For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.0005 and shipped it to Mamou.   The total transport cost   is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).   We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price   and the transport expense?---"

The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool and incur transport.   Therefore having two zone would more accurately represent what is actually happening.I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.DavidImelda Frayre05/03/2000 08:07 AMTo: David Oliver/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: William Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Sea Robin Well Head CurveWell, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently.   Currently, there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of ISRP.   That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility mappings.   Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.   However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities would have to change the zone on every single facility record.   Plus, we would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities made it's change.   So, let me know what your thoughts are.   What are you doing in London???Imelda---",

The variable transport cost on Cove PointLNG is less than $0.0005/Dth.   This gas was hedged by CES as baseload withdrawalduring the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of thecontracts which is 2/29/2000.2.

Our proprietary file contacts the business party id, ratherthan the DUNS number.   Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's business party id.   Theseare the valid business parties we use:ENA   5304Brooklyn Union   219995 Columbia Energy Services 5092Columbia Energy Marketing 7772As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various producers, we willneed to include their business parties as well.   For now, this is all we need.   In the meantime,should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert into Unify as do notsend???Also, another continuing problem is the 8999 default ranking.   We spend a great deal of time overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 8999 as the swing activity to be cut as we needit.   Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing activity to 8999???Thanks for you help.Beverly3-6357\n"

When Scott gets back next week, we will together with him and Dick to verify what needs to be moved and take care of it manually until system resources can handle it.David   \tFrom:   Colleen Sullivan   05/03/2000 10:07 AM To: David Oliver/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Transport P&amp;LDavidIs there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market area pipes to the Market East p&amp;l?   If the only reason is that you're not sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion.   It seems to me that there are only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee, Texas Eastern and Transco.   For now, why don't we leave all the demand charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the East p&amp;l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East book:   Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG, Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to make sense to me.   Please advise.\n"

One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.   It was nice.   I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!   The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.   All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.   I could really get used to that sort of thing.The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.   I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.   She stayed with me all weekend.   I took her to the airport this morining.   Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.   I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.   That was a little odd.Nothing else going on.   I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.Later Gator.\n"

        " Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2000 06:12 PM ---From: Colleen Sullivan on 03/30/2000 12:23 PMTo: mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com @ ENRONcc: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, John M Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: storage clarification &amp; issues   Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:1, 2:   The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month changes does appear to be an issue.   Since the contract didn't spell out in detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly (during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.   I know Chris Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.   I will ask that he forward this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.   Let me know if you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.3.   Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms here.   Here is what is happening:   Your people are nominating this production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.   That means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual contract prices with the producers.   So, this is one issue we will have to address as indemnification items.   That's problem one.   Problem two is that I am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all the nominations.   We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is what you want).   For Jan, Feb &amp; Mar, however, it appears that we will be the ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.4.   Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the pipeline invoices on to you.   Maybe we should change this process to one where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his confirmation and review of all the charges.   This means you may see quite a bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.   Let us know what you would prefer.   Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to your office yesterday, March 29.   Chris will get all remaining demand charge statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.   I apologize for the delay.5.   Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a packet of all the confirms---he is in Calgary today and will be back on Monday.

Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.   According to ChrisGermany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month usinggas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.2.   Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though somepipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates tointra-month changes.   I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricingmechanism and then apply it consistently.3.   Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singerpurchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was notremoved from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.   We need to discuss how tohandle this production.4.   Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000invoice.   As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.   Also,Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requestedback-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't receivedanything.5.   Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in placewith Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do nothave executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.   Rich Contos and Ihave both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but wecan't seem to find the right person over there.Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.Thanks,Melissa - storage proxy.xls\n"

        " Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 03/30/2000 12:47 PM ---From: Colleen Sullivan on 03/30/2000 12:23 PMTo: mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com @ ENRONcc: Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dick Jenkins/HOU/ECT@ECT, John M Singer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: storage clarification &amp; issues   Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:1, 2:   The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month changes does appear to be an issue.   Since the contract didn't spell out in detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly (during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.   I know Chris Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.   I will ask that he forward this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.   Let me know if you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.3.   Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms here.   Here is what is happening:   Your people are nominating this production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.   That means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual contract prices with the producers.   So, this is one issue we will have to address as indemnification items.   That's problem one.   Problem two is that I am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all the nominations.   We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is what you want).   For Jan, Feb &amp; Mar, however, it appears that we will be the ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.4.   Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the pipeline invoices on to you.   Maybe we should change this process to one where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his confirmation and review of all the charges.   This means you may see quite a bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.   Let us know what you would prefer.   Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to your office yesterday, March 29.   Chris will get all remaining demand charge statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.   I apologize for the delay.5.   Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a packet of all the confirms---he is in Calgary today and will be back on Monday.   Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?   If not, please advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory balances.mflewellyn@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/28/2000 12:43:555 PMTo: \" - *colleen.sullivan@enron.com\" &lt;colleen.sullivan@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: storage clarification &amp; issuesI forgot the storage attachment ...---",

A customer meetingwill be held in Washington DC on August 1, 2000 at 10:000 a.m.(please see the Transit posting dated July 14, 2000) and in Houstonon August   3, 2000 at the Williams Tower, Level 5, Dining Room Cat 1:000 p.m.   The Houston meeting will address both the segmentationchanges and highlights of Transco's Order 637/637A Compliance filing,with segmentation being discussed from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. and theOrder 637 discussed from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m.   In order to finalizethe appropriate arrangements for the meeting, Transco requeststhat you notify Liz Laurel at 713-215-2069 by Monday,July 31, 2000.There are two key elements to the proposed changesin Docket RP000-17-000:1.   Use of \"Master\" FT-R Commodity ContractsTransco will no longer use the \"Master\" Commodity Form of ServiceAgreement for reservation rate capacity releases.   Historically,Transco has required capacity release shippers to execute two FT-Rcontracts upon their initial acquisition of released capacity:the FT-R Demand contract and the FT-R \"Master\" Commodity contract.With subsequent reservation rate releases, shippers were onlyrequired to execute new FT-R Demand contracts.   Each FT-R Demandcontract was specific to a capacity release deal and the FT-R\"Master\" Commodity contract was used for all nomination andcommodity billing purposes.Effective with business for gas day September 1, 2000, Transco willrequire shippers acquiring capacity through reservation ratecapacity releases to execute and nominate transportation on eachnew FT-R Demand contract.   This will require new activities to becreated for each capacity release contract.   For any capacity releasedeals that span the August 31 - September 1 period, nominations forgas day August 31, 2000 will be on the existing \"Master\" Commoditycontract and nominations for gas day September 1, 2000 will be newtransactions on the FT-R Demand contract.   Additionally, allcommodity billing will be done on the FT-R Demand contract.Transco will send a \"Notice of Termination\" to all FT-R \"Master\"Commodity contract holders identifying the contract that willterminate as well as a list of all of the FT-R Demand contractsthat will continue to be effective in September.2. Limiting nominations within a segmentConsistent with FERC's ruling in this docket and consistent withsimilar rulings on Tennessee and Texas Gas, Transco will limit thequantity of gas that can be scheduled   IN ANY SEGMENT of thepipeline to the original firm contracted capacity.Transco will aggregate all nominations under an original FTcontract and any related capacity release contracts(or subsequent re-releases) to ensure that the total scheduledquantity for the family of contracts is within the originalcontractual entitlement.   If nominations for the family ofcontracts exceed the original entitlement, nominations usingany secondary capacity rights will be considered as secondarynominations and subject to cut on a pro-rata basis.As stated above, Transco intends to implement these changes for gasday September 1, 2000.   In the event systematic changes cannot becompleted or the FERC directs Transco to modify its plannedimplementation, Transco will notify customers via TRANSIT of anybusiness practice changes as well as the expected implementationtimeline.If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contactyour Customer Services Representative or Scheduling Analyst. - C.DTF\n"

There is no Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;April = 15%May = 20%June = 20%July = 20%Aug = 20%Sept = 13%Oct = 7 %If you add these months up, the total Injection is 1115%. Essentially, shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April (15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval (I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. Some other basic rules;Shippers do not have to fill storage 1000% by October.Shippers cannot have more than   60% in storage by June 1st, unless overinjection is approved by TCO.Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need to be used to avoid overrun charges.Why do we care about all of this...Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for overinjections above 36,304.TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing   penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.Please save this note for future reference.\n"

Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling generous.FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to cause unnecessary pain.63281/236 coh 7-1   2934/287263281/170 coh 7-5   19222/1888163281/999 coh 5-2   427/41863281/2221 cpa8-35 1639/160463281/2220 cpa8-35 5111/5000Total   74333/7275\n"

I would prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the delivery points.I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the month.   Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt and delivery point on the contract.   But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it and I am unable to verify the information myself.   It could have a big impact on what we flow in Z6.Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?   Let me know if you need specific capacity examples.\n"

They arealready in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.   The Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and deliverypoints that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among other things.Chris Germany08/10/2000 12:24 PMTo: Victoria Versen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Alvin Thompson/Corp/Enron@Enron, Marlene Hilliard/HOU/ECT@ectcc: Beverly Beaty/HOU/ECT@ECT, Judy Townsend/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Goodell/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Brenda H Fletcher/HOU/ECT@ECT, Victor Lamadrid/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Terminating Transco contractsAs most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity contracts effective 9/1/2000.

        " Chris Germany/HOU/ECT on 02/04/2000 12:20 PM ---   \tFrom:   Colleen Sullivan   02/03/2000 09:03 AM To: Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Dan Junek/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Germany/HOU/ECT@ECT, Judy Townsend/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Transport formula settlesScott---Something for you to consider:If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as possible.   This means using as few \"formula based\" curves as possible and as many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.   I'm not sure how you or your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating transport p&amp;l.   In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.   These could potentially be used for CNG North &amp; South Citygates and TCO citygates.   The only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index posted each day---it is a range of prices instead.Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES business in our portfolio, the times have changed.   Currently we are using \"formula based\" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport p&amp;l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and how we are marking the curves.   For example, today's Gas Daily postings compared to our curve markings are as follows:GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVESTCO pool $2.985   $1.565   $.10TCO citygate $4.555CNG North $3.39   $   .585   $.16CNG South $3.305   $   .670   $.16~CNG Citygate $3.975Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.   There are two solutions that I see.   One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.   That's up to you.   Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), we need to focus on it being accurate.Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations. ---",

The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE NORTH POINT &amp; CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will be CNG TRANSMISSION TT SOUTH POOL &amp; CNG TRANSMISSION TT NORTH POOL.   There may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4 points.   The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission locations will be Scott Hendrickson.   The business systems director at CNG   Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.   Her phone number is 304-623-8213 and her e-mail is iris_g._king@cngt.cng.com.   She is also onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as possible.If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN ADVANCE!!!   ---",

It is good to know people outside of the company are wanting additional locations to trade on EOL.Can you let me know which trader will be trading this location? Dale Neuner, in our group, will coordinate adding these locationsfor EOL trading.Thanks!Victor Lamadrid03/23/2000 04:26 PMTo: Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Katherine L Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: two new locationsHey Jennifer,   How are you?We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.   They have rolled out a new pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and CNG Transmission South pool.   It's different than CNG South Point and CNG North Point.   These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.   As they have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new locations in the future.   These new services on CNG Transmission have the benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being (until October at least)...How do we go about adding these two new trading locations on EOL.   Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you would like... Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!\n"

Just a brief update to let you all know what ishappening.   This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book ofRomans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.   I think that isthe most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.   I asked the studentsone day who lead them to Christ.   Everyone single one of them have beensaved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing intheir school over the last year.   But what was even more exciting than thatwas the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.   All of theothers were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family.That young man's name is Anifa.   He came to Christ through one of thepograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown somuch, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion toChrist.   Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.   Anifawill honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole schoolknows that he is a man of prayer.   Recently Anifa asked me if I would teachhim how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go backand reach his people for Jesus.Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated,because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won asingle Muslim to Christ.   Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because Ihave won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others.Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates,and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler.They will be coming in June and July.   We will be starting 2 new Churches,and ministering in the schools.And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that wasstarted last summer by the team from Southwestern.I look forward to seeing you all this year.   Angela and I are praying aboutGod's direction for our future.   Please pray with us that for God's guidanceas we plan for our future together.   God bless.Chad Germany___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com\n"

The only changesversus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun000 EPA Vols' showvolume requirements at the various citygates.   I have not adjusted our volumerequirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per ChrisGermany's e-mail of 5/24/000.   However, I have inserted notes indicating whereand what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by localproduction per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.Also:   The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/999 EnergyPurchase Agreement between Enron and CES.   During June 2000 CES will beprocuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should notbe confused with this request.Doug KinneyPh:   703-561-63339Fax:   703-561-7317 - Jun000_FOM_Req4.xls\n"

Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con)Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the desk P&amp;L.ConsSomewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be.May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions.

HAVE DINNER READY: Plan ahead, even the night&lt; before, to have a&lt;   &lt; delicious meal - on time.   This is a way of letting him know   that&lt; you&lt;   &lt; have &lt; been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs.&lt; Most&lt;   &lt; men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a good&lt; meal are&lt;   &lt; part of the warm welcome needed.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 2.   PREPARE YOURSELF: Take 15 minutes to rest so you&lt; will be refreshed&lt;   &lt; when he arrives.   Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your hair&lt; and be&lt;   &lt; fresh looking.   He has just been with a lot of work-weary people.&lt; Be a&lt;   &lt; little gay and a little more interesting. His boring&lt;   &lt; day may need a lift.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 3.   CLEAR AWAY CLUTTER.   Make one last trip through the&lt; main part of&lt;   &lt; the house just before your husband arrives, gathering up&lt; schoolbooks,&lt;   &lt; toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your&lt; husband will&lt;   &lt; feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and it will give&lt; you a&lt;   &lt; lift too.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 4.   PREPARE THE CHILDREN.   Take a few minutes to wash&lt; the children's&lt;   &lt; hands and faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if&lt; necessary,&lt;   &lt; change their clothes.   They are little treasures and he would like&lt; to see&lt;   &lt; them playing the part.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 5.   MINIMIZE THE NOISE: At the time of his arrival,&lt; eliminate all noise&lt;   &lt; of washer, dryer, or vacuum.   Try to encourage the children to be&lt; quiet.&lt;   &lt; Greet him with a warm smile and kiss, letting him know you're glad&lt; to see&lt;   &lt; him.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 6.   Some DON'TS: Don't greet him with problems or&lt; complaints. Don't&lt;   &lt; complain if he's late for dinner.   Count this as minor compared&lt; with what&lt;   &lt; he might have gone through that day.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 7.   MAKE HIM COMFORTABLE.   Have him lean back in a&lt; comfortable chair or&lt;   &lt; suggest he lay down in the bedroom.   Have a cool or warm drink&lt; ready for&lt;   &lt; him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes.   Speak in&lt; a low,&lt;   &lt; soft, soothing and pleasant voice.   Allow him to relax and unwind.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 8.   LISTEN TO HIM: You may have a dozen things to tell&lt; him, but the&lt;   &lt; moment of his arrival is not the time.   Let him talk first.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 9.   MAKE THE EVENING HIS: Never complain if he does not&lt; take you out to&lt;   &lt; dinner or to other places of entertainment; instead try to&lt; understand his&lt;   &lt; world of strain and pressure and his need to be home and relax.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; 10.   THE GOAL: try to make your home a place of peace&lt; and order where&lt;   &lt; your husband can relax.&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n"

        " Clayton Vernon/Corp/Enron on 12/16/999 02:03 PM ---Clayton Vernon12/16/999 01:59 PMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Vince and Vasant:Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at the East Desk, related to gas transmission:Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay $12.000 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs (\"shrinkage\") and 6.5% for overhead expenses.   A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 (\"basis\"), and might call Brooklyn and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .   The trader's spread is $0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.2225 for firm capacity tomorrow.   As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum (\"it's not worth their time to haggle\") (There is a further issue of \"secondary markets\" not important to the model yet).   For South Texas and Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take (pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).   And, once the trade is in the system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.Clayton\n"

As always, if you have any questions,please let me know.   I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick forsignature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need todiscuss.   Below is a brief description of each.   Please let me know how youthink we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having anin-person meeting down in your office.1.   Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.   According to ChrisGermany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month usinggas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.2.   Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though somepipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates tointra-month changes.   I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricingmechanism and then apply it consistently.3.   Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singerpurchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was notremoved from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.   We need to discuss how tohandle this production.4.   Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000invoice.   As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.   Also,Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requestedback-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't receivedanything.5.   Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in placewith Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do nothave executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.   Rich Contos and Ihave both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but wecan't seem to find the right person over there.Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.Thanks,Melissa\n"
