This price was increased to $16.000 to encompass trades transacted via the telephone. The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:Nicor Gas Company was closed for   their company holiday on Friday, December 222nd.   As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for   the December 222-26 time period.   Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 222-26 time period.   Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 222nd (even though they were closed)   for the December 23-26 time period, which resulted in a $13.888 posting for the December 23-26th period.   I received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 222nd.   My practice is to take the price as reported on Enron Online.   On occasions there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.   Due to timeliness of sending the price report, my volume is overstated, as opposed to intentionally reporting erroneous information.\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nJohnThe questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially different from the Thursday index.   We did not transact at Nicor City Gate on Friday and did not submit a change in trades to Gas Daily.   I will discuss this with you tomorrow. ---"

You'll see that there are both opportunities and potholes for us on this issue.   It is very likely that we will get sucked into this debate---the ENA/ Peoples deal which has generally floated under the regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent. (Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on natural gas issue on Jan 23).   The articles (and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks) point out that Peoples is in hot water politically---I would hate to see us dragged into that sesspool.   On the other hand, if ENA sees significant business opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the regulatory climate, this could be the time to make the play...while the issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that they normally would not.I'd appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on Illinois.   I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC.   Roy and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request from the ICC...I have not heard back from her, but Roy may have.   Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call?   ---",

To solve gas bill crisis, turn heat up on PeoplesCrain's Editorial - January 15, 20001Considering the finger-pointing that's going on between politicians,regulators and Peoples Energy Corp. executives, one thing is becomingobvious: Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas pricesis much simpler than fixing the problem.Nonetheless, all of these factions bear some responsibility for thiswinter's monthly home heating bills, which, for many residents, are soaringby hundreds of dollars over last winter's tabs. Each of these groups shouldbe held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed toblunt future price spikes.Make no mistake about it, this crisis will not melt away with the springthaw. Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue topump up bills, rattle price stability and, along with other climbing energyrates, become the economy's unwelcome \"X\" factor.The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities,especially Peoples Energy, the city's natural gas provider. To start with,the utility's management must protect customers by anticipating escalatingdemand, hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can.These are common business practices, used by corporations and even someconservative utilities. In Michigan, for example, gas providers charge fixedrates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advanceunder long-term supply contracts. Right now, Michigan pays 29 cents pertherm, compared with the Chicago area's whopping 98 cents.Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when itcould not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC),which regulates the utility, on what the fixed rate should be. In walkingaway from the deal, Peoples left customers with the current rate system anddumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them.In essence, instead of managing risk, it put its customer base at risk.Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout, critics are askingwhether Peoples, a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the public'sneeds, is acting in the best interest of its customers. Those paying heatingbills - which in some cases are as much as 3000% higher than last winter's -are right to say no, as is Mayor Richard Daley, who's outraged at Peoples.More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to thechallenge of resolving this crisis, especially if its recent handling of thepolitical fallout is an indication. The company acts as if the public has noright to question its tactics or motivations. And when the Chicago CityCouncil held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week,Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didn't show up.At these prices, it's not asking too much for the chairman of the gasutility to explain his company's position. That's not a job meant for apublic relations executive or a consultant, who were among the Peoplesadvocates who actually did attend the council hearing.The ICC shoulders its share of the blame, too. It should have more zealouslymonitored the gas supply situation and the utility's plans. Now, thecommission is playing catch-up by holding an investigation into what Peoplesknew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it.Let's get an answer to that important question and find out once and for allif there is price-gouging going on.Just as critical, however, is the need to foster a statewide regulatoryenvironment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging, storing andprice-control strategies. If there is any ambiguity in state law about theutility's ability to do this, then the General Assembly should change therules and open up the process.Peoples management, regulators and politicians must get beyond the blamegame and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes inenergy prices.Otherwise, we're all just burning money.Gas flare-up gives city hot idea: Become a utilityBut co-ops mean high risks, mild rewardsUtility man: William Abolt, head of Chicago's Department of the Environment,is examining ways to cut residents' natural gas bills. One option: opening acity-owned buying co-op. Photo: Steve Leonard   January 15, 20001By Steve Daniels &lt;mailto:sdaniels@crain.com&lt;It's easier said than done.That's something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about tolearn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gas-purchasingduties on behalf of city residents.Mr. Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corp.'s failureto anticipate the rising cost of natural gas, to mitigate a huge run-up inresidents' monthly heating bills this winter. He thinks the city can aidbill-payers, and punish Peoples, by developing a system that will funnellower-cost gas to ratepayers.But the track record of other municipal gas utilities, or buyingcooperatives, shows that such a system isn't likely to achieve more thanmodest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significantfinancial risks.To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers thiswinter, the city would have to buy futures, or long-term contracts, thatcould leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially.In addition, the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as thecollection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to non-payingcustomers - activities for which municipalities are ill-suited.Despite the risks, utility critics contend that city intervention isappropriate.\"It's a creative approach, and we need those,\" says Martin R. Cohen,executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer watchdog group.\"These are extreme times, and innovative approaches are called for.\"Most municipalities that have gotten into the gas-buying business have beenunwilling to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts that can shieldconsumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this year'shome-heating bills soaring nearly 3000% compared with last year's. That'sbecause such arrangements can boomerang on customers, locking them intohigher-than-market gas costs if prices fall.New York experience\"We wrestled with this: Should government really be in this business?\" saysDavid Fountaine, village administrator in Hamburg, N.Y., a suburb of Buffalothat formed a buying group for its residents in April 1999. \"In our case, bybeing in it, we've helped our residents.\"Hamburg and nearby Sloan, N.Y., together hired a unit of Texaco Inc. tosupply gas to residents who signed up for the communities' program. New Yorkopened its natural gas market to competition five years ago, so residentscan choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outsidemarketer.About one-third of Hamburg's 3,3000 households buy gas from the village.Those residents' gas bills last winter were 8% lower than the bills ofhouseholds that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co. Lastmonth, when gas prices shot up, the village's price was 15% lower than theutility's.But Mr. Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks, making nolong-term bets on the direction of gas prices. Rather, it simply relies onits contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible.Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area,but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings.\"We know there are a lot of relatively new risk-management techniques beingused by large (natural gas) consumers,\" says William Abolt, commissioner ofthe city's Department of Environment. \"We want to know, what does theindustry do to manage (price) risk? That's what the reasonable company does,but that's not what the local gas company does.\"City officials need look no further than Downstate, where the IllinoisMunicipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of 20 communities thatprovide monopoly gas service to their residents. Last September, the agencylocked in prices for 50% to 75% of their customers' winter gas needs,rolling with the market for the remainder.That strategy is serving the agency's customers well. They're paying around70 cents per therm - the measurement the gas industry uses for billing -this month, compared with the 98 cents per therm that Peoples is chargingChicago-area customers.\"There's no reason why investor-owned utilities couldn't do the same thing,\"says John Bell, the Municipal Gas Agency's general manager. \"I think (a cityprogram) is a viable alternative if they don't like what they've got.\"For its part, Peoples supports the city's desire to become involved in themarket. The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesn't profit ongas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas tocustomers.Meanwhile, the city is just beginning to consider alternatives. Although Mr.Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans duringthis trying season, a program most likely will be launched next winter.Weighing the risksThe city's top priority will be to help low-income residents most vulnerableto escalating heating bills, but all Chicago residents might be able tochoose between the city's program or remaining with Peoples. And onepossibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixedprice for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with themarket.While a fixed-price approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now, itcan have a downside if not managed properly.In the Buffalo area, the two major private gas marketers offering fixedprices to households recently dropped out of the residential market, forcingsome 23,000 customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service.To meet the unanticipated demand, the utility was forced to purchase gas onthe sky-high spot market.It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing. Says Mr. Abolt:\"This is not an overnight thing. You don't just snap your fingers and ithappens.\"David I. FeinPiper Marbury Rudnick &amp; Wolfe203 N.

Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in the rotation process.   I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other departmentsRecent successes and current projectsIdeas on the horizonOpportunities in your business unit for AA's The benifits of rotation in your business unitAn open Q&amp;A sessionThese presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have handouts.   The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them ask questions about each business unit.   Also, bringing one of your current AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.   Ted Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a presentation.   The first \"brownbag\" will take place September 8 between 12:000pm and 1:000pm in Room 30 C1.Dave\n"

He said that PGL is not staffed to confirm all 4 cycles of the nomination process and that ENA will start to get cut after the 2nd cycle if nominations are not correct.I told Mark that I would get back with him early next week and let him know why ENA has had to consistently make changes at every nomination cycle.   Also, please inform your schedulers of the risk that they are taking if nominations are not correct after the 2nd cycle (especially on weekends!).

The bulk of this production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.   In the winter, the US daily load is greater than 555 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 555 BCF.   Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load.Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.   However these states produce more gas than they consume.   Most other states consume more gas than they produce.   Therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances.   Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and move gas to the areas of greatest demand.Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking.   Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.Hunter\n"

Affect TheoryA fact is this summer the NE never got very hot.   Therefore the Great Lakes didn't heat up as much as normal. Argument is then that the cool fronts might be colder to the NE actual temps b/c of winds off the colder Lakes.   Does the lake affect snow theory cover this or would this be the infamousShively Windchill Effect I used to hear so much about when on Central ???May be the reverse will happen, please enlighten me if you know something...It might be interesting to take a look at the historical water temps. of greatlakes historical vs current year, may be the Enron depth of research can investigate.Here is the link, I haven't had the time to do it yet...http:///www.ndbc.noaa.gov/stuff/greatlake/grtlmap.shtml\n"

At this time, we would like to demonstrate the MKM pilot   to you.To refresh your minds, MKM is a one-stop shopping for market data and associated activities.   The project is done in collaboration between two groups in Houston and one in London.   In November/December 1999 some of you took part in user forums to discuss the feasibility of a one-stop shop for market dataBackground:The intention is that all existing systems (i.e. various databases and services) will be linked through a common infrastructure that will allow all these systems to provide the services they have always provided plus a set of standard services, such as:SecurityData ValidationNotificationAuditing, and Calculation.In addition, it will allow client applications to ask MKM for the data and services they need instead of going to individual systems.   The point here is that the user (or application) will not need to know where the data resides, andwill have a uniform level of services across all systemsDemonstration:A pilot was developed to prove the underlying technology and to provide users a simple demonstration of the product to derive exact user requirements.The demo will include the following components:Browser: provides a user interface for publishing and retrieving a limited selection of price and volume data for gas and power busines units;Time Series Index: stores time series metadata;Message Station: an inbox which holds inbound time series data;TIBCO messaging backbone: underpins MKM and is transparent to the user;and Connectivity to two market data servers:- LIM (Houston) and PR1P(London).The remaining components will be delivered in following phases.I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to demo of the product.

The version that has been released is not in its final phase.   Many of the rules of the business have to be tested and changed to reflect the correct data representation.   The only way for us to do this is to have the current users who will be using the system to verify the correctness of the data.   Due to this fact, it is not recommended that this system be used for trading purposes until the portion of the system being worked on is verified to be in fact correct in its representation of the data.   It is still imperitive that   this system is viewed daily for its correctness, validation, fault tolerance and efficiency on a daily basis, for this is where we devise our metrics on the systems completeness.   Currently there is a new update version of the application that resides in Chicago that delivers the data to the website.Our current contact has been sent to a training in Canada and will not be available until Jan 20, 20001.   Due to this I would like to set up a meetingto: Application Status Report   1. Show the Parts of the application that currently are ready to be used   2. Discuss the portions of the application that are currently in \"Beta\" (not ready)   3. Discuss a testing process to bring these portions up to Production Status (ready for usage) Evaluate Current Project   1. Does the project currently meet customer needs   2.   Additions / Changes to fit needs   3. Business Rules Changes   Customer   1. Customer Site Feedback   2. Developer / Management Feedback   3. Outstanding Issues\n"

It sounds like Caroline Abramo is sharing some of Mike's research and the Fundamentals research with some of the hedge funds.   Do we want to keep sending her the information or limit it to certain pieces of research.   Do we make any/enough money off of their business to provide them with our internal research?   I have told her in the past that the quarterly production numbers that we provide are for internal use only, but it sounds like some of the information is going outside of Enron.

I think they have real potential to be very valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is from Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years and who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major tenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he has done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how much comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also wholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see prices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production numbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the historical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes in production have been.The info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do not share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that we can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading strategiesUnfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY but I am working on it.   I am sure a lot of this info is up there.Rgds,CA212 702 3910---",

This paper sheds alot of light on why Cal. is problematic.   Jeff, Jim S., and I talked about it today because of Kevin's desire to be able to float his entire position against the pool and the reg. group idea that some \"penalty\" or separate charge should be attributed to those that cause the big congestion (primarily because of the Cal. problem that day of is cheaper than day ahead due to the caps.)Steve Walton09/07/2000 09:13 PMTo: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Jeff Brown/HOU/EEES@EES, James D Steffes/HOU/EEES@EES Subject: Price SpikesChristi, I found this to be a very interesting paper on the California Price Spikes.

I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the front-end.   She did not like that idea.   Her proposal is that an IT person can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants front-end production to be handled by her group.

As I am sending you this email, we do not know where to move him.   I have contacted   Lorie Belsha who handles the majority of the floor planning and their are no spaces to   move him.   She advised that we look to find a space with his direct report Bryan Powell   and asked me to contact Peggy McCurley, who then advised I talk to Cheri Westbrook.   When talking to Cheri Westbrook, she indicated that you have some space allocated   to you, but she was unsure if you have specific plans for them or if you would have (4)   spaces for Adam, to accomodate his immediate need.   I will be out of the office when you are back in on Wednesday, please advise Adam if   there is any space available.   I will call in to see if I can be of further assistance in this   search.   To help you expedite this process when you have come back (in hopes that you   have space available for Adam), I have attached the churn request.   You will need to   fill in the areas that I left blank (i.e, titles for new hires, cost center, TO location).   All the   equipment to be moved has been entered on the churn.   Additionally, when sending the request into the move-team, please say \" This move   request is for the (5) spaces reserved by Heather Choate for the January 2, 20001 churn\".

The powerpak deal that we have with them is for the testing period of March and April.   I have talked with our Storage team regarding putting the gas in on Friday and Saturday of this week and pulling out on Sunday but they are really tight and aren't sure they can handle it.   Is there any way that we can buy the 45000 MMBtu for Sunday only? And, if so, what is the cost differential?   Thanks!Janetx-7141 \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Chris Meyer @ ECT   01/02/20001 03:27 PM To: Kelli Stevens/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Oscar Dalton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Hunter S Shively/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet Bowers/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: GRE   Kelli - the GRE deal is set to begin in May (per the long-term agreement).   The interconnect is complete and testing will begin this coming Sunday.   GRE is responsible for noms during testing.   (As you may recall, ENA will be responsible for noms to storage once the deal begins.)   GRE wishes to buy 4,5000 MMBtu for this coming weekend. This purchase is not covered under the long-term gas deal; therefore, I presume you'll show GRE an offer at   Demarc or VenturaYour contact (during testing) will be Janet Bowers (Omaha x7141).   Please give Janet a call to arrange this weekends gas supply.   We may be able to sell/deliver the 4,5000   on Thursday or Friday.Janet -   Kelli can be reached at (713) 853-1828.Call with any questionsThankschrisx31666\n"

As I mentioned,I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with AirProducts and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have readabout Enron.   Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends whomight be kind enough to \"keep their eyes open\" and share thoughts and ideasas to companies I should contact.I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.   Asyou can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strongoperations background.   I would certainly enjoy another position as anOperations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range ofindustries.   Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would bevery encouraging.   I am open to any avenues you suggest.Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.   Itseems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few selectintroductions.   Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or whocan direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.   The more contacts Imake, the more opportunities I can uncover.If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.   I will contact youagain in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.

The first Super Saturday weeke=\rnd=20\ris the weekend of October 27th and 28th.   We have undergone a rigorous=20\rinterview process on campus, which will allow us to focus on =01&amp;selling=01=\r8=20\rcandidates that are invited to Houston for Super Saturday.   Students will=\r=20\rarrive on Friday afternoon and will depart on Sunday morning.   We have=20\ractivities planned for the entire weekend.   The goal is to implement a Supe=\rr=20\rSaturday process that allows for consistent and meaningful hiring decisions=\r=20\rwhile also allowing the candidates exposure to a greater number of Enron=20\remployees.   To that end, we have made the following changes:\rFriday Evening Dinner.   The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =\r =20\rWe will provide transportation for all candidates.   We will continue to hav=\re=20\rsmall tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=\rnd=20\rfour (4) students.   There will be a group cocktail hour at the restaurant=\r=20\rbefore the dinner.   This will enable the Enron employees to meet and evalua=\rte=20\rmore students.   It will also give the students broader exposure to Enron=20\remployees.\rSaturday Interviews.   Interviewers will receive their interview packages=\r=20\r(schedules and resumes) at breakfast on Saturday morning. This will=20\rfacilitate last minute cancellations of interviewers and/or candidates.   We=\r=20\rhave allowed time to review resumes before the interview process. To=20\rfacilitate the completion of the evaluation form on each student, the=20\rinterviewers will remain in an assigned interview room and the students wil=\rl=20\rrotate.=20\rIn prior years, the interviewers have interviewed eight (8) candidates. =20\rInterviewers will now interview only five (5) candidates.   The remainder of=\r=20\rthe time will be spent in the decision-making meeting. It is essential that=\r=20\rall interviewers attend the decision-making meeting and that all evaluation=\r=20\rforms are completed and input prior to the meeting.=20\rDecision-Making Meeting.   Rather than asking the interviewers to return on=\r=20\rMonday afternoon, we will hold the decision-making meeting on Saturday=20\rfollowing the interviews and lunch.   The meetings are scheduled from 1:30 P=\rM=20\rto 3:30 PM and will be facilitated by members of Enron=01,s executive manag=\rement=20\rteam.   Dave Delainey will facilitate the October 28 meeting.   Kevin Hannon,=\r=20\rJeff Shankman, John Lavorato, Rick Causey and Dan Leff will facilitate=20\rsubsequent meetings.=20\rNeed for interviewers.   There has been a tremendous response to the call fo=\rr=20\rdinner participants; however, we are still in need of interviewers for each=\r=20\rof the Super Saturdays.   Please respond with your willingness to interview=\r=20\rat:   http:///axis.enron.com/notice/sssinvite.asp   =20\r(When selecting dates please avoid selecting to interview candidates who=20\rattend the schools for which you are a team member).\rWe thank you in advance for your participation and support of the program.\n"

He is available the morning of the 1st.   He is flyingout of Intercontinental at 2:45 PM.   As far as I know he will be travellingalone.   He   has not requested my presence yet.The purpose of his visit is to see first-hand a world-class energy tradefloor and to begin networking with key industry personnel.   He is new tothis side of the business.   His previous role was NiSource CIO; so he comesinto his new position with a systems and process oriented view.   Hisresponsibilities at NiSource encompass the regulated gas supply managementand gas control operations of eight of NiSource's gas utilities (two areprimarily managed by EnergyUSA-TPC - NIFL and Kokomo).   He is responsiblefor Bay State (and Northern Utilities), NIPSCO, and the ColumbiaDistribution Companies (five LDC's).   We are currently fragmented inMassachusetts, Columbus and Indiana and are in the process of evaluating howto bring this together, functionally, locationally, or not at all.   TJreports to Pat Mulchay, who is President of the Merchant Energy Division.Pat reports directly to Gary Neale, our CEO.TJ's previous background includes a stint at Fidelity Investments, so atrade floor is not new to him.Please confirm Enron's address and if you don't mind, recommend a hotel thatis convenient.   Let me know who will be meeting TJ then we can   turn thedetails of finalizing the arrangements over to TJ and your designee.   Thanksfor your help. - C.DTF\n"

Texas desk VaR dropped to $3.8FrankPS.   Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.   Would you consider sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to both power and gas?   I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.   Let me know your thoughts\n"

I want you to know I will always go out of my way to help you and your traders develop and use good models.I need tools, and Kevin has been fantastic supporting with these. He's alread bought a $25,000 Sun server to be dedicated to real-time mathematical models.Can   I can tentatively count you \"in\" on the SAS software. Our current license expires Sep. 14 (ie, soon), and I need to knowing where a total of $40,000 is coming from. As it turns out, I \"need\" to count on Gas for around $15,000, which I note is a lower price to you for unlimited user access than you would pay for a single-workstation SAS PC license. Remember, not only are many of the calculations you need   too big for Excel, my own Gas Model will run in SAS and will be available to you. And, Carmen Ayala in Contract Administration, will support you every step of the way here, since her assignment is to wean Enron from an obscenely expensive emerging addiction to SAS-PCI'm sorry to have to bug you like this, but I have a deadline staring me in the face.Clayton\n"
