Let's set aside this evening to hearken back to our younger days... when peer pressure was still cool. Experienced IDHAFR's can attest, this is no \"Company Cocktail Buffet\". IDHAFR newbies will just have to take our word for it. Last year I said, \"we'll see what new lows we can achieve\"... Little did I know!!!   Dolls in the freezer, RIVER DANCING... ON THE FURNITURE (picture my head held in shame). I will make no such prediction this year. I can't even promise that there will be a Man in Black. But I can promise you'll be sorry you missed it!We hope this notice finds everyone in good health and spirits this new millennium (actually that's still a year away but...) So mark your calendar: (Out of town guests are surely welcome, sleeping (?) arrangements can always be found. Although I must say I didn't like having to share the space under the pool table in '96!)You will probably have to park far away.   Neighbors are pretty friendly. \n"

With the=\r=20\rclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\r=20\rInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\r We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\r=20\rthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\r=20\rcase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\r=20\rcomputer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20\rClickAtHome includes the following:\r ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=\r=20\rdisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\r=20\rsoftware. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\r=20\rconnection, including broadband, where commercially available.\r? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\r=20\rand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\r=20\rhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\r,=20\rEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\raccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.   Eligibility includes being=20\remployed at the time of implementation. =20\r? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 20001, with delivery of=\r=20\rthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.   Delive=\rry=20\rof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 20001.\r Details about this program are still being finalized.   To address some of=\r=20\ryour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\r=20\rhttp:///clickathome.enron.com.   We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=\rar=20\rfuture where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20\rsubmit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20\r We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20\rfamily.

At the close of business for the 9991 P&amp;L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.   We thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.   Therefore, the net impact of 999111 PMA's is $41,1119 or 2% of last day P&amp;L.I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&amp;L for the month of November.-Eric\n"

The Guardian newspaper reports that \"The Muslim's Handbook,\" written byretired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoidthe face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford aservant, he could take a second wife.   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which isaffiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, thedirectorate --- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics formosques --- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to includeexpanded roles and rights for women.   \"I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, withmoney women paid in taxes,\" said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a grouppromoting women in politics.   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man couldbeat his wife --- and included tips and instructions --- although itcounseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse. \n"

Also the original person called in sick at the lastmoment,and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table askingdirectionsto the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other twojudges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, andbesidesthey told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.Here are the scorecards from the event:Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster ChiliJUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried   paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers toput the   flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans arecrazy.Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner ChiliJUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken   seriously.FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am   supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off twopeople   who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to   walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look onmy face.Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn ChiliJUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I   have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine bynow.   Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the   front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.Chili # 4: Bubba's Black MagicJUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or   other mild foods, not much of a chili.FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to   taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind mewith fresh refills;   that 3000 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just likethis nuclear-waste   I'm eating.Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip RemoverJUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding   considerable kick. Very impressive.JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit   the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted   and four people behind me needed paramedics. Thecontestant   seemed offended when I told her that her chili had givenme brain   damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouringbeer directly   on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that theother judges asked   me to stop screaming.   Rednecks!Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian VarietyJUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice   and peppers.JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.   Superb.FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,sulfuric   flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me exceptbig Sally.   I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation ChiliJUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can ofchili   peppers at the last moment. I should note that Iam worried   about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bitof distress   as he is cursing uncontrollably.FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't   feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, andthe world sounds   like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is coveredwith chili which   slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full oflava-like stuff to   match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'llknow what   killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's toopainful. Screw it, I'm   not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll justsuck it in through   the 4 inch hole in my stomach.Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint ChiliJUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,not too bold   but spicy enough to declare its existence.JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild norhot. Sorry   to see that most of it was lost when JudgeNumber 3 passed out,   fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.Not sure if he's going   to make it. Poor Yank.FRANK: ---(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable To report)\n"

Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these pooling zones.   I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.Thanks in advance.Sincerely,Eric Bassx3-09777\n"

A Texas A&amp;M University student who claimed he had been raped bya dog &lt;was yesterday jailed for 12 months. &lt; &lt;Martin Hoyle, 20, was arrested by police after the passengers of apassing &lt;car witnessed a Bull Terrier, called Badger, having sex with Hoyleon the &lt;side of Highway 290, just north of Hempstead. &lt; &lt;Assistent District Attorney Ben Crossland said the passengers ofthe car,an &lt;unidentified couple from Houston, had stopped to help because theythought &lt;Hoyle was being attacked by the animal.   But when they got closerthey saw &lt;that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles, was down on all fours,and the &lt;dog was straddling him from behind. &lt; &lt;\"The defendant mumbled something about the dog having taken aliking to &lt;him,\" said Mr Crossland.\"The couple were extremely offended andsickened by &lt;what they saw.\" Another individual in a passing car contactedpolice on a &lt;cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked with the dog onthe &lt;feeder road. &lt; &lt;Hoyle, of College Station, told police \"I can't help it if the dogtook a &lt;liking to me.He tried to rape me.\" He repeated the rape allegationat &lt;the police station and added, \"The dog pulled my jeans down.\" &lt; &lt;Hoyle, who has been arrested several times on alcohol-relatedcharges, was &lt;jailed for 12 months after he admitted committing an act thatoutraged &lt;public decency. His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory of the incidentbecause &lt;of his intoxicated state, but was now very remorseful andincredibly &lt;embarrassed. &lt; &lt;Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCallum told Hoyle \"Never before in mytime at &lt;the bar or on the bench have I ever had to deal with somebody who &lt;voluntarily allowed himself to be molested by a dog on the public &lt;highway. Frankly it is beyond most of our comprehension. It is an &lt;absolutely disgusting thing for members of the public to have towitness.\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\n"

A Texas A&amp;M University student who claimed he had been raped bya dog &lt;was yesterday jailed for 12 months. &lt; &lt;Martin Hoyle, 20, was arrested by police after the passengers of apassing &lt;car witnessed a Bull Terrier, called Badger, having sex with Hoyleon the &lt;side of Highway 290, just north of Hempstead. &lt; &lt;Assistent District Attorney Ben Crossland said the passengers ofthe car,an &lt;unidentified couple from Houston, had stopped to help because theythought &lt;Hoyle was being attacked by the animal.   But when they got closerthey saw &lt;that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles, was down on all fours,and the &lt;dog was straddling him from behind. &lt; &lt;\"The defendant mumbled something about the dog having taken aliking to &lt;him,\" said Mr Crossland.\"The couple were extremely offended andsickened by &lt;what they saw.\" Another individual in a passing car contactedpolice on a &lt;cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked with the dog onthe &lt;feeder road. &lt; &lt;Hoyle, of College Station, told police \"I can't help it if the dogtook a &lt;liking to me.He tried to rape me.\" He repeated the rape allegationat &lt;the police station and added, \"The dog pulled my jeans down.\" &lt; &lt;Hoyle, who has been arrested several times on alcohol-relatedcharges, was &lt;jailed for 12 months after he admitted committing an act thatoutraged &lt;public decency. His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory of the incidentbecause &lt;of his intoxicated state, but was now very remorseful andincredibly &lt;embarrassed. &lt; &lt;Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCallum told Hoyle \"Never before in mytime at &lt;the bar or on the bench have I ever had to deal with somebody who &lt;voluntarily allowed himself to be molested by a dog on the public &lt;highway. Frankly it is beyond most of our comprehension. It is an &lt;absolutely disgusting thing for members of the public to have towitness.\" &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;\n"

The intent of this period (quick overview) is to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.   This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month increments.It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled internally by EOL.   Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.   Because of this, there should be heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.   These trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human intervention.   This has not been started.   In the meantime, a deal of this nature will have to be entered manually.How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?   Once the EOL product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.   The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal accordingly.   For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:   Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara ticket   Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07   04/10   04/14   04/17   04/21   04/24   04/28   Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade. Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open ended.   Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date is on the path; otherwise the number of reconciling items will increase.Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.SRM (x333548) \n"

So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.   Everyone just relax because its going to be a long one.   As Always, Brace Yourself.Where to begin?   How about those Tigers?   They are on track to be the SEC West Basketball Champions.   Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like \"Spring Break Everyday!\"   That's great!   I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams are on a winning streak.   Geaux Tigers!Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!   I recently learned that, while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart, Sarah, got \"Tanked\" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of the Pat O Brian's   Piano Bar in front of a minister saying \"I DO\" to her boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.   On such short notice, they were unable to find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated all night at Dante's Pizza.   I hear it was one hell of a party.   Congratulations Sarah!Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.   I'd like to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and Kenny K with him.   If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.   The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:   The last night of the ball after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary Landrieu and saying,\"Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans Lady?\"   That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future---a regular James Carville!   I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy Edwin Edwards a question - \"Governor who do you like in the President's Race?\"   He responded, \"Have the odds come out already?!?\"   No doubt a man of true character.I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.   Brandon, a full time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.   He decided to put his \"Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back, Jack, haircut \" to work on the Internet.   He's currently modelling his sweet hair style as \"Mullet of the Week\"   at http:///www.mulletsgalore.com/ .   He gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site to help an aspiring doctor.February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.   I still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate, Matt.   Although the chances of him finding one before me are pretty good considering all he's looking for is, and I quote, \"A girl who is pretty and who thinks I am smart just because I read the newspaper.\"   ICE---ICE---BABY---TOO COLD---TOO COLD!Everyone have a great weekend!CKL \n"

Name the five wealthiest people in the world.&lt;&lt; 2. Name the last five Heisman trophy winners.&lt;&lt; 3. Name the last five winners of the Miss America&lt; contest.&lt;&lt; 4. Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer&lt; prize.&lt;&lt; 5. Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for&lt; Best Actor and&lt; Actress.&lt;&lt; 6. Name the last decade's worth of World Series&lt; Winners.&lt;&lt;&lt; How did you do?&lt;&lt; The point is, none of us remembers the headliners of&lt; yesterday. These&lt; are&lt; no second-rate achievers. They're the best in their&lt; fields.   But the&lt; applause dies. Awards tarnish. Achievements are&lt; forgotten. Accolades&lt; and&lt; certificates are buried with their owners.&lt;&lt; Now here's another quiz. See how you do on this one:&lt;&lt; 1. List a few teachers who aided your journey through&lt; school.&lt;&lt; 2. Name three friends who have helped you through a&lt; difficult time.&lt;&lt; 3. Name five people who have taught you something&lt; worthwhile.&lt;&lt;&lt; 4. Think of a few people who have made you feel&lt; appreciated and&lt; special.&lt;&lt; 5.

Whilstin&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; the&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; lounge, I noticed Bill Gates sitting on the chesterfield&lt; enjoying&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; a&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; cognac. I was meeting with a very important client who wasalso&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; flying&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; to&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Seattle with me but she was running a bit late. Being aforward&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; type&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; of&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; guy, I approached Mr. Gates and introduced myself. I explained&lt; to&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; him&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; that&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; I&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; was conducting some very important business and how I would&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; appreciate&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; it&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; if he could throw a quick   \"Hello Chris\" at me when I was with&lt; my&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; client.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; He agreed. Ten minutes later while I was conversing with my&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; client, I&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; felt a tap on my shoulder. It was Bill Gates. I turned around&lt; and&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; looked&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; up at him.

Some atheist goesto a high   school football game, hears a kid say a short prayer before thegame and gets   offended.?

I don'tagree with Darwin, but I didn't go   out and hire a lawyer when my high schoolteacher taught his theory of   evolution.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Life, liberty or your pursuit of happiness   will not be endangeredbecause someone says a 30-second prayer before a   football game. So what'sthe big deal??? It's not like somebody is up   there reading the entire book ofActs.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; They're just   talking to a God they believe in and asking him to grantsafety to the   players on the field and the fans going home from the game.&lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; \"But it's a Christian prayer,\" some will argue. Yes, and this is   theUnited States of America, a country founded on Christian principles And   weare in the Bible Belt.? According to our very own phone book,   Christianchurches outnumber all others better than 2000-to-1.? So what   would youexpect - somebody chanting Hare Krishna??? If I went to a   football game in&lt; &lt; Jerusalem, I would expect to hear a Jewish   prayer.? If I went to asoccer game in Baghdad, I would expect to hear a   Muslim prayer.? If I wentto a ping pong match in China, I would expect   to hear someone pray toBuddha.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; And I wouldn't be   offended.? It wouldn't bother me one bit. When inRome...&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"But what about the atheists?\" is another argument.? What   about them?Nobody is asking them to be baptized.? We're not going to   pass thecollection plate.? Just humor us for 30 seconds.? If   that's asking too much,bring a walkman or a pair of ear plugs.? Go to   the bathroom.? Visit? theconcession stand.? Call your   lawyer.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Unfortunately, one or two will make that call.   One or two will tellthousands what they can and cannot do.? I don't   think a short prayer at afootball game is going to shake the world's   foundations.? Nor do I believethat not praying will result in more   serious injuries on the field or morefatal car crashes after the game.?   In fact, I'm not so sure God would even&lt; &lt; be at all these games if He   didn't have to be.? That's just one of thedownsides of omnipresence. If   God really liked sports, the Russians wouldnever have won a single gold   medal, New York would never play in a WorldSeries and Deon Sanders' toe   would be healed by now.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Christians are just sick and   tired of turning the other cheek while ourcourts strip us of all our   rights.? Our parents and grandparents taught usto pray before eating,   to pray before we go to sleep.? Our Bible tells usjust to pray without   ceasing.? Now a handful of people and their lawyers aretelling us to   cease praying.? God, help us.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; And if that last   sentence offends you - well...just sue   me.&lt;&lt;\n"

If you want theceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lotof different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them getsto talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave methe gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of thosegreat men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect youwith your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom ofthought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating thememorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, \"We arenow engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation orany nation so conceived and so dedicated can longendure.\" Those words are true again. I believe that we are againengaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about tohijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty insideyou ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness intothe miracle that it is.Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the NationalRifle Association, which protects the right to keep andbear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... Iserve as a moving target for the media who've called meeverything from \"ridiculous\" and \"duped\" to a \"brain-injured,senile, crazy old man.\" I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I surethank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs ofthose who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized thatfirearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger thanthat. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging acrossour land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptablethoughts and speech are mandated.For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 ---long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told anaudience last year that white pride is just as valid as black prideor red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. Butwhen I told an audience that gay rights should extend nofurther than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during aspeech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jewsand singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against mycountry. But when I asked an audience to oppose thiscultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.&lt;From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentiallysaying, \"Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You areusing language not authorized for public consumption!\"But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in politicalcorrectness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to theBritish crown.In his book, \"The End of Sanity,\" Martin Gross writes that\"blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as thenorm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be newcustoms, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularlyfoisted on us from every direction.Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mindmushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and rightfrom wrong. And they don't like it.\"Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young menseeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at eachstep of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In NewJersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who hadbeen infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- thestate commissioner announced that health providers who areHIV-positive need not. ... need not ... tell their patients thatthey are infected.At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of theschool team \"The Tribe\" because it was supposedly insultingto local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefstruly like the name.In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting therights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and fortranssexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoingsex change surgery.In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have beenplaced in bilingual classes to learn their three R's inSpanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At theUniversity of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands diedat Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that collegeofficially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said \"Negroes.\"Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said \"black.\" But it's ano-no now.For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly\"Native-American.\" I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I alsohappen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. Onmy wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American... with a capital letter on \"American.\" Finally, just last month... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of PublicAdvocate, used the word \"niggardly\" while talking to colleaguesabout budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy orscanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize andresign.As columnist Tony Snow wrote: \"David Howard got fired because somepeople in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaningof 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discoverthe meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for theirignorance.\" What does all of this mean? It means that telling uswhat to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so tellingus what to do can't be far behind.Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why didpolitical correctness originate on America's campuses?And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposedto debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what theyreally believe? It scares me to death, and should scareyou too, that the superstition of political correctness rules thehalls of reason.You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradleof American academia, here in the castle of learning on theCharles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and yourcounterparts across the land, are the most sociallyconformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-byyour grandfathers' standards-cowards.Here's another example. Right now at more than one majoruniversity, Second Amendment scholars and researchers arebeing told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose theirjobs. Why? Because their research findings would underminebig-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds ofmillions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shockedat that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the rawmaterial of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the corevalue of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thoughtand expression lay down your arms and plead, \"Don't shoot me.\" Ifyou talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If yousee distinctions between the genders, it does not make you asexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does notmake you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebratehomosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubatorsfor this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on thesteps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousandpeople. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, ofcourse. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think orwhat to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocolthat stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... wholearned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other greatman who led those in the right against those with the might.Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with thatDisobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sentThoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, thatprotested a war in Vietnam.In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow culturalcorrectness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, socialdirectives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you putyourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You mustbe willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalentof the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.Let me tell you a story.A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was sellinga CD called \"Cop Killer\" celebrating ambushing andmurdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other thanTime/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least onehad been murdered. But Time/Warner wasstonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the mediawere tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in BeverlyHills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.What I did there was against the advice of my family andcolleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of athousand average American stockholders, I simply read the fullyrics of \"Cop Killer\"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.\"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFFI GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFFI'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFFI'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF...\"It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. Buttrust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanchedfaces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs andstared at their shoes. They hated me for that.Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racistfilth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year oldnieces of Al and Tipper Gore. \"SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...\"Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say Ileft the room in echoing silence.When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said\"We can't print that.\" \"I know,\" I replied, \"but Time/Warner _sselling it.\"Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'llnever be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review fromTime magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,not just talk.When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jamthe switchboard of the district attorney's office. When youruniversity is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of thestudents graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board ofregents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on theplayground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment...march on that school and block its doorways.When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betraysyou ... petition them, oust them, banish them. WhenTime magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazyChristians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycottheir magazine and the products it advertises.So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in thehallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history thatfreed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in thehands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, byGod's grace, built this country.If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.Thank you. - att1.htm\n"

No matter how you may want to spell TEAM... there is no \"I\" in it.MelLessons of the GeeseThis Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in \"V\" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they fly that way.FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an \"uplift\" for the bird immediately following. By flying in a \"V\" formation, the whole flock has at least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on the thrust of one another.FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and another goose flies to the point position.LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up front to keep up their speed.LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch up with their flock.LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and each other in difficult times as well as in good!~ Written by Angeles Arrien ~___Message: 3   Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2000 14:32:50 -04000   From: Sandra Anderson &lt;sandraan@concentric.net&lt;Subject: Any of ya's ???Hey guys just heard Mark E. won't be able to attend - any other SARmanagers out there - - Kathleen on Peter's team ?Dawn on GLSAR team ?Dave Holcomb ?Looks good on the resume guys - - will be work but educational too - -___Message: 4   Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2000 14:40:20 -04000   From: Sandra Anderson &lt;sandraan@concentric.net&lt;Subject: Camping invite/GLSAR drillJust a lil' invite   - - GLSAR is having an overnight wilderness/workdrill the last weekend of the month on my property -   120 acressurrounded by 4000 acres federal land just north of Cadillac and east ofMi-Wa-Taka Mich. - - rolling hills , serious color time , tough terrainetc.Camping is planned for Friday and Sat. nights - work all day Sat. , sun.break camp.You'll need water / food/warm clothes / tents .

Tines / The Detroit NewsMetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other dogs with attitudes.By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief   A sizable increase in the number --- and severity --- of dog bites in Metro Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.   At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto &amp; Home, no longer writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German shepherds and bull terriers.   \"Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to match the risk with the rate,\" said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife vice-president.   \"Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly.\"   The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites --- from medical treatment to \"pain and suffering\" damage awards.   A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has bitten someone.   \"We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers,\" said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 companies nationwide.   \"Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up.\"   Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 1,574 dog bites --- up 38 percent from 19996.   Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a year earlier.   The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said the number of bites there remained constant at about 8000.   Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 million dog bites were reported in 19997.   Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.   \"It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem,\" said his father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly at the neighbor's house.   \"I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and went for his throat.\"   The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly half of all children will be bitten by age 12.   Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy mills, he said.   \"More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls this year simply because there are so many more of them,\" he said.   \"But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive animals.   \"People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that are suing.\"   Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service now is routinely suing dog owners.   Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles \"quite a few\" dog bite claims and he has seen \"a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood.\"   He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.   \"There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are bitten by dogs,\" Bernstein said.   State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, said it had 4441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 19996.   \"For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm,\" said John Carroll, a company spokesman.   The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.   \"We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to bite,\" Carroll said. \"But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the situation.   \"The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on premises.\"   Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year --- up 27 percent from 19996.   \"We had been running at about a 3 p___Message: 16   Date: Sun, 10 Sep 2000 222:111:21 EDT   From: Leonard Lauria &lt;leonard@speedy.cc.uky.edu&lt;Subject: Re: Text file/SEMINARwatch it jeff!&lt;&lt; Dan...you got that one...Either way someone is going to lose a mobile home!&lt; Either you have done a lot of Ky searches, or Virginia used to be part of Ky&lt; but formed it's own state because everyone ran out of relatives to marry!&lt;&lt; :)   Jeff&lt;--- Leonard Lauria   Greater Kentucky Search Dogs, President/K9 Handler leonard@uky.edu   http:///speedy.cc.uky.edu/GKSD Sr. Systems Programmer UK Computing Center   Madison Co.

You have certainly had morethan your share of pain this year. Next year will be better. Saw the e-mailfrom Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what wewere doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they werein any event welcomed to join us. Why don't we put together something simplewith the boys and D and S? We still have that wonderful Champagne from lastyear.Maybe we could go to dinner early @ SWCC, then back home for games andChampagne. Let me know what you think. If that sounds good, I will call SWCCand find out the details. I am assuming the boys are available. Love you-L\n"

When you lose, don't lose the lesson.&lt;   &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3.

LET IT REALLY   SINK IN.? THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU START YOUR DAY. Michael is the   kind of guy you love to hate. He is always in a good mood and   always has something positive to say.? When someone would ask him   how he was doing, he would reply, \"If I were any better, I would   be twins!\" He was a natural motivator.? If an employee was   having a bad day, Michael was there telling the employee how to look   on the positive side of the situation. Seeing this style really   made me curious, so one day I went up to Michael and asked him, \"I   don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the time.   How do you do it?\" Michael replied, \"Each morning I wake up and say   to myself, you have two choices today.? You can choose to be in   a good mood or...you can choose? to be in a bad mood.?   I choose to be in a good mood.? Each time something bad happens, I   can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn from it. I choose   to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can   choose to accept their complaining or...I can point out the positive   side of life. I choose the positive side of life. \"Yeah,   right, it's not that easy,\" I protested. \"Yes, it is,\" Michael said.   \"Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every   situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You   choose how people affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood   or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live your   life.\" I reflected on what Michael said. Soon hereafter, I left   the Tower Industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often   thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of   reacting to it. Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved   in a serious accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications   tower.? After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care,   Michael was released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.   I saw Michael about six months after the accident. When I asked him   how he was, he replied. \"If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna   see my scars?\" I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what   had gone through his mind as the accident took place. \"The first   thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my soon to be   born daughter, \" Michael replied. \"Then, as I lay on the ground, I   remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live or ...I   could choose to die. I chose to live.\" \"Weren't you scared? Did you lose   consciousness?\" I asked. Michael continued, \"...the paramedics were   great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they   wheeled me into the ER and I saw the expressions on the faces of the   doctors and nurses, I got really scared.? In their eyes, I read   \"he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take action.\" \"What did you   do?\" I asked. \"Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions   at me,\" said Michael. \"She asked if I was allergic to anything.   \"Yes, I replied.\" The doctors and nurses stopped working as they   waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, \"Gravity.\"   Over their laughter, I told them, \"I am choosing to live. Operate on   me as if I am alive, not dead.\" Michael lived, thanks to the   skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I   learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully.   Attitude, after all, is everything. \"Therefore do not worry about   tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. After all today is the   tomorrow you worried about yesterday. You have two choices now:   1. Delete this. 2. Forward it to the people you care about. You   know the choice I made. \n"

He thought &lt;&lt;he would do a good deed and pulled the van over. &lt;&lt;He asked the priest, &lt;&lt;\"Where are you going, Father?\" &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;\"I'm going to give Mass at St. Patrick's Church, &lt;&lt;about five miles down the road,\" replied the priest. &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;\"No problem, Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb &lt;&lt;in!\"   The priest climbed &lt;&lt;into the passenger seat, and the van continued &lt;&lt;down the road. &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;Suddenly, the driver saw a A &amp; M fan strutting &lt;&lt;down the road, and &lt;&lt;instinctively, he swerved as if to hit him. But, &lt;&lt;as usual, just in time, &lt;&lt;he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the guy. &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;Even though he was certain he missed the guy, he &lt;&lt;still heard a loud &lt;&lt;\"THUD.\" Not understanding where the noise came &lt;&lt;from,   he glanced in his mirrors, &lt;&lt;but he didn't see anything. &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;He then remembered the priest, and he turned   to &lt;&lt;the priest and said, \"I'm &lt;&lt;sorry, Father. I almost hit that Aggie fan.\" &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;\"That's OK,\" replied the priest. \"I got &lt;&lt;   him with the door.\" &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;FOOTBALL SEASON'S HERE!

Ted Kennedy, Charles Schumer and Barbara Boxer strongly denounce&lt; &lt; private gun ownership. Their bodyguards; however, carry:&lt; &lt; A.   Berettas&lt; &lt; B.   Glocks&lt; &lt; C.   Garbage can lids&lt; &lt; D.   Slingshots&lt; &lt; E.   Very heavy purses&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 2. You and your baby daughter are awakened in the middle of the night by&lt; &lt; your estranged, abusive ex-husband. Although you have a restraining&lt; &lt; order against him, he is drunk and beats down your front door with a&lt; &lt; crowbar screaming, \"If I can't have you, nobody can!\" You   should:&lt; &lt; A.   Call Barbara Boxer.&lt; &lt; B.   Call 9111, and tell them that they should arrive within 30&lt;seconds.&lt; &lt; C.   Threaten legal action.&lt; &lt; D.   Grab a ping-pong paddle.&lt; &lt; E.   Reason with him (maybe he was an abused child).&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 3.   Since 1987, 34 states have enacted concealed carry laws. Violent&lt; &lt; crime decreased in these states and the anticipated \"Dodge City\" mayhem&lt; &lt; never materialized. Even critics were surprised. Concealed carry&lt; &lt; succeeded because:&lt; &lt; A.   Sunspot activity decreased after 1987.&lt; &lt; B.   Trigger locks rendered guns inoperative and therefore safe.&lt; &lt; C.   Sarah Brady scared the crooks away.&lt; &lt; D.   A healing wave of pacifism swept over the hearts of criminals in&lt; &lt; these 34 states.&lt; &lt; E.   Janet Reno said that crime should stop.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 4.   Schools, churches, subways, and restaurants have often been&lt; &lt; assaulted, but rarely military bases, police stations, or shooting&lt; &lt; clubs. The reason for this is because:&lt; &lt; A.   The targets aren't sitting or kneeling.&lt; &lt; B.   VA benefits are lost if you shoot a soldier.&lt; &lt; C.   You can't enter an army base without bumper stickers.&lt; &lt; D.   Schools don't threaten felons with detention hall.&lt; &lt; E.   All of the above.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 5.   Logic, reason, and common sense:&lt; &lt; A.   Are irrelevant if they contradict your feelings.&lt; &lt; B.   Should not apply to firearms.&lt; &lt; C.   Defy opinion polls.&lt; &lt; D.   Pale beside hysteria, fear, and political ambition.&lt; &lt; E.   All of the above.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 6.   Every dictator always disarms his victims, before beginning to&lt; &lt; annihilate freedom loving people. The reason for this is because:&lt; &lt; A.   Guns cause crime.&lt; &lt; B.   Guns cause accidents&lt; &lt; C.   Guns cause suicides&lt; &lt; D.   Being defenseless is the only way that mothers can demonstrate&lt; &lt; their love for their children&lt; &lt; E.   All of the above&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Blaming guns for what happened at Columbine is like blaming spoons for&lt; &lt; Rosanne for being fat.\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 20th Century Patriot&lt; &lt;&lt;___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com\n"

Scroll down for each answer.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; The questions are not that difficult.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 1. How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; The correct answer is:&lt; &lt; Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close the door.&lt; &lt; This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in&lt; &lt; an overly complicated way.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 2. How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Wrong Answer:&lt; &lt; Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant and close the refrigerator.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Correct Answer:&lt; &lt; Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant&lt; &lt; and close the door.   This tests your ability to think through&lt; &lt; the repercussions of your actions.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 3. The Lion King is hosting an animal conference.   All the animals&lt;attend&lt; &lt; except one.   Which animal does not attend?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Correct Answer:&lt; &lt; The Elephant. The Elephant is in the refrigerator.   This tests your&lt; &lt; memory.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; OK, even if you did not answer the first three questions correctly, you&lt; &lt; still have one more chance to show your abilities.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 4. There is a river you must cross. But it is inhabited by crocodiles.&lt;How&lt; &lt; do you manage to cross it?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Correct Answer:&lt; &lt; You swim across. All the Crocodiles are attending the Animal&lt; &lt; Meeting. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; According to Andersen Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the&lt;professionals&lt; &lt; they tested got all questions wrong.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; But many preschoolers got several correct answers.   Anderson Consulting&lt;says&lt; &lt; this conclusively disproves the theory that most professionals have the&lt; &lt; brains of a four year old.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com.Share information about yourself, create your own public profile athttp:///profiles.msn.com.\n"

Scroll down for each answer.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; The questions are not that difficult.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 1. How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; The correct answer is:&lt; &lt; Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close the door.&lt; &lt; This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in&lt; &lt; an overly complicated way.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 2. How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Wrong Answer:&lt; &lt; Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant and close the refrigerator.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Correct Answer:&lt; &lt; Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe, put in the elephant&lt; &lt; and close the door.   This tests your ability to think through&lt; &lt; the repercussions of your actions.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 3. The Lion King is hosting an animal conference.   All the animals&lt;attend&lt; &lt; except one.   Which animal does not attend?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Correct Answer:&lt; &lt; The Elephant. The Elephant is in the refrigerator.   This tests your&lt; &lt; memory.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; OK, even if you did not answer the first three questions correctly, you&lt; &lt; still have one more chance to show your abilities.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; 4. There is a river you must cross. But it is inhabited by crocodiles.&lt;How&lt; &lt; do you manage to cross it?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Correct Answer:&lt; &lt; You swim across. All the Crocodiles are attending the Animal&lt; &lt; Meeting. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; According to Andersen Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the&lt;professionals&lt; &lt; they tested got all questions wrong.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; But many preschoolers got several correct answers.   Anderson Consulting&lt;says&lt; &lt; this conclusively disproves the theory that most professionals have the&lt; &lt; brains of a four year old.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com.Share information about yourself, create your own public profile athttp:///profiles.msn.com.\n"

Unlike most chain letters, this one does not cost&lt; &lt;   &lt;anything.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;Just send a copy of this letter to five of your friends who are&lt;equally&lt; &lt;   &lt;tired and discontented.   Then bundle up you wife or girlfriend and&lt;send&lt; &lt; her&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;to the man whose name appears at the top of this list, and add your&lt;name&lt; &lt; to&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;the bottom.   When your turn comes, you will receive 16,2555 women. One&lt;of&lt; &lt;   &lt;them is bound to be better than the one you already have.   At the time&lt;of&lt; &lt;   &lt;writing this, a friend of mine had already received 184 women,   4 of&lt;whom&lt; &lt;   &lt;were worth keeping.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;Remember - this chain brings luck.   One man's cat died, and the next&lt;day&lt; &lt; he&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;received a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;You can be lucky too, so DO NOT BREAK THIS CHAIN!   One man broke the&lt;chain&lt; &lt;   &lt;and got his own wife/girlfriend back.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;Good Luck !!!&lt; &lt;&lt;___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com\n"

But you&lt;know I'm not really sure. I wonder and then I think about the 5 pounds&lt;I gained this past month. I bet he thinks I'm a fat hog now. Anyway, in&lt;the cab back to his house, I say that I love him and he just puts his&lt;arm around me, but doesn't squeeze.

So I try to ask him about it but he just switches on the TV.&lt;Reluctantly, I say I'm going to go to sleep. Then, after about 10&lt;minutes or so, he joins me and we have sex. But, he still seems really,&lt;really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to leave. I roll over and&lt;sniffle a little real quietly. He snores.

The closer it gets to the end,the faster it   goes.   that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.   that money doesn't buy class.   that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.I've learned...   that under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciatedand   loved.   that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think   I can?   that to ignore the facts does not change the facts.   that when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting thatperson   continue to hurt you.I've learned...   that love, not time, heals all wounds.   that the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myselfwith   people smarter than I am.   that everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.   that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feelingtheir   breath on your cheeks.I've learned...   that no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.   that life is tough, but I'm tougher.   that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.   that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.I've learned...   that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow hemay   have to eat them.   that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.   that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.I've learned...   that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in hislittle fist, that   you're hooked for life.   that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happinessand   growth occurs while you're climbing it.   that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it isrequested and   when it is a life-threatening situation.   that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.AuthorAndy Rooney&lt;\n"

After the wedding,&lt;at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk&lt;to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many&lt;from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted&lt;to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new&lt;father-in-law for providing such a fabulous&lt;reception. To thank everyone for coming and bringing gifts and&lt;everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift from just&lt;him.   So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair was a manila envelope,&lt;including the wedding party.   He said that this was his gift to everyone,&lt;and told everyone to open the envelopes. Inside each manila envelope was an&lt;8 x 10 picture of his best man having sex with the bride.   He had gotten&lt;suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them&lt;weeks prior to the wedding. After he stood there and watched the people's&lt;reactions for a couple of   minutes, he turned to the best man and said&lt;\"F--- you\", he turned to the bride and said \"F--- you\", and then he turned&lt;to the dumb founded&lt;crowd and said \"I'm out of here.\" He had the marriage annulled first thing&lt;that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement&lt;immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with&lt;it anyway as if nothing was wrong. His revenge:   Making the bride's&lt;parents pay over $32,000 for a 3000 guest wedding and reception.   Letting&lt;everyone know exactly what did happen. And best of all, trashing the&lt;bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends, their&lt;entire families,&lt;i.e. their parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, nieces and&lt;nephews, etc. Yes, revenge when applied properly, like this way, can&lt;be sweet eh?&lt;___Get Your Private, Free Email at http:///www.hotmail.com\n"

      "body": "\nSIPPING VODKAA new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardlyspeak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.The monsignor replied, \"When I am worried about getting nervouson the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the waterglass.   If I start to get nervous, I take a sip.\"So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginningof the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.   Heproceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, hefound the following note on the door:1.   Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.2.   There are 10 commandments, not 12.3.   There are 12 disciples, not 10.4.   Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.5.   Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.6.   We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.7.   The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are notreferred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.8.   David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.9.   When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don'tsay he was stoned off his ass.10. We do not refer to the cross as the \"Big T.\"111. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper hesaid,\"Take this and eat it for it is my body.\"   He did notsay, Eat me\"12.   The Virgin Mary is not called \"Mary with the Cherry,\"13.   The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dubthanks for the grub, yeah God.14.   Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest atSt.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.The origination of this letter is unknown, but it bringsgood luck to everyone who passes it on.   The one who breaks thechain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.   Do not send money.Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.   Youwill   see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chainis not broken.\"I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try toplease everyone...\"- Bill Cosby...___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com.Share information about yourself, create your own public profile athttp:///profiles.msn.com.\n"

Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a trueenvironmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $5000,000 of income lastyear.   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobaccowhen   he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted governmentsubsidies.   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in facthe was   placed by family influence in a \"cushy\"   correspondent's job andthe only   action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegallyraising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because theVanderbilt Law   educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sumsof political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vowsof poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to \"invent theInternet\" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeksof potentially   incriminating e-mail!   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper werethe models for the book and movie, \"Love Story\" even though the book'sauthor,   Erich Segal, says not.   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer'schampion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a milliondollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of PresidentClinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remainsilent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton \"one ofthe greatest Presidents of our history.\"   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when theywon't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record soineffective   that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH ofTennessee's   Senators!   111.   Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who willbe the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he servedto the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run downslum   house that he was renting to them.   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons aregenerally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt toactually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from theirailment, since it may be   harmful to their well-being, yours, mine andthat of the USA.   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out toaid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,   PLEASE, pass this on toyour normal   friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediatetreatment.\n"

But that's exactly w=\rhat=20\rthe Buffaloes will be trying to do this week. Colorado has won six straight=\r=20\ragainst UT dating to 1989.

I felt lik=\re=20\rthe line and all the kids really cut it loose for the first time this seaso=\rn.=20\rWe were a much more focused team.\"=20\r=09\r=09On Texas: \"Texas is the most talented team we'll face this year, maybe i=\rn a=20\rcouple years. They are loaded with talent on both sides of the ball, and th=\rey=20\rhave depth. You've got to think after their loss (to Oklahoma), they will=\r=20\rcome in here really inspired. It should be a good matchup.

He's forced the hand of a lot of players and gotten commitments=20\rearly. They have been able to hand-pick the players they want out of Texas.=\r=20\rWhen you can get Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas in the same=20\rclass, something is going on. Something good. We recruited all of those=20\rplayers. The hype around Simms had something to do with it, too.

And were there any oth=\rer=20\rpromotions to the starting lineup?=20\r=09??? Marge Ringer=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on=\r=20\rTuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a=\r=20\r\"need-to-win\" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is =\rno=20\rplan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the=\r=20\roffense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive=\r=20\rcoordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB=20\rrotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other=20\rpromotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and R=\roy=20\rWilliams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches mad=\re=20\rthese promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take=\r=20\rmore of a vocal leadership role. And coaches said freshman tight end Brock=\r=20\rEdwards might see more playing time, and running back Kenny Hayter will see=\r=20\rmore carries than the two he had against OU last week.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]\r=09Kenny Hayter=20\r=09\r=09Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a b=\rigger=20\rrunning back during first and second down to increase their chances at a=20\rthird-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-dow=\rn=20\rback who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a=\r=20\rguy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on=\r=20\rfirst and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as=20\rwell, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and=20\rlong   situations due to not\r=09\r=09picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion,=\r is a=20\rmore physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in ther=\re=20\ron first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in=20\rHodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands an=\rd=20\ris a reliable blocker. =20\r=09??? Eric Barker, Plano, Texas=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game=\r=20\rbecame a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in th=\re=20\rsecond half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said h=\re=20\rwas foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw=\r=20\rand score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice thi=\rs=20\rweek, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game? =20\r=09??? Lance Kyles=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed =\rto=20\rbring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to ne=\rxt=20\ryear's OU game.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get=\r=20\rpressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?=\r=20\rGive us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these   topics?=\r=20\r=09??? Cody Anderson, Houston=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin=\rg=20\rgame became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT wa=\rs=20\rforced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot =\rof=20\rtime, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus=\re=20\rhe is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this=\r=20\rweek. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference=\r,=20\rbut Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge=\rrs=20\rwas in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20\raccording to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20\rdefense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like=\r=20\rrunning backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for bi=\rg=20\ryards.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:I began following Longhorn football when I arrived at UT in   19995, and=\r no=20\rone was more shocked than me when the alumni and DeLoss Dodds   turned on Jo=\rhn=20\rMackovic so viciously after the loss to UCLA in 19997. Not only was I appall=\red=20\rat the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that   this was par for=\r=20\rthe course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly=20\rembraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm   worried we are=\r=20\rabout to see a repeat of history. What do you think?=20\r=09??? Lisa Davis, Austin=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around=\r=20\rAustin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive=20\rcoordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond=\r=20\rafter being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that thi=\rs=20\rgame with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,=\r=20\rthe Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart =\rin=20\rorder to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are real=\rly=20\rin the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the=20\rchances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas Sta=\rte=20\rand at Texas A=02?are slim. The chances are good the Sooners will emerge wi=\rth at=20\rleast two losses in those games. Texas can get right back in the race with =\ra=20\rwin Saturday. If the Longhorns do win and UT looks good with Major Applewhi=\rte=20\rat QB, then everyone will say \"I told you so, Mack\" regarding the QB rotati=\ron=20\rhaving slowed down UT's offense all season. But the critical fans will also=\r=20\rembrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but=\r=20\rthey will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for=\r=20\rthe rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.=\r=20\rHe'll be around Texas for a good while.=20\r=09&lt; ?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]\r=09Casey Hampton=20\r=09\r=09Q:I know I have no right to criticize coaching because I don't have any =\ridea =20\rwhat I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that =\r=20\rafter a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said   numero=\rus=20\rtimes that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'   inconsistenc=\ry,=20\rand most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern   UT seems to=\r=20\rfollow amazes me. Every few games, everything just blows up and   we are=20\rembarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage   to scr=\rew=20\rup horribly in random=20\r=09\r=09games? My only thought is that it has to be   the coaching. It's not like=\r the=20\rplayers aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter   proves in the OSU game to be the=\r=20\rsolution to the running game's problem.   Why replace him the next weekend i=\rn=20\ra much bigger game with the truly   hard-working, but honestly inefficient=\r=20\rHodges Mitchell? Why run the ball   over and over when it obviously doesn't=\r=20\rwork? Or it could work, if the   right players were in... These things baffl=\re=20\rme. Do you think the coaching   is one of the problems? What can be done to=\r=20\rfix the inconsistencies that   are actually becoming consistent and developi=\rng=20\ra pattern of embarrassing   losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then=\r=20\rthe last three awful   games. This year, it's   mediocre Stanford, and the go=\rod=20\rbut not THAT good   OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.=\r=20\r=09??? David Rowe, Austin=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma =\rgot=20\rit going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in t=\ro=20\rslow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanc=\rhe=20\rwas on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense=\r.=20\rGiving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I=\r=20\rbelieve. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t=\rhe=20\roffensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n=\ro=20\rvocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B=\rut=20\rnone of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20\rineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth=\rer=20\rhe is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20\rCoaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You=\r=20\rcan't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is=\r=20\rinherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20\rHampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah=\ran=20\rneeds to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to=\r=20\rstep up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to =\rhave=20\rthe team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20\rwrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20\rcoming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the=\r=20\rplay-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly   uncreative. On=20\rdefense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and=\r=20\rthe defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa=\rme=20\rblitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis=\r=20\rseem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista=\rke=20\ror setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some=\r=20\rexcitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t=\rhe=20\rsideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU=\r=20\rwith a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20\respecially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20\rtendencies also?=20\r=09??? Todd Purl=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating =\rhis=20\rplay calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h=\ras=20\rdone well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus=\rt=20\rusing that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50=\r=20\rwith the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line=\r=20\rcan't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei=\rng=20\rbalanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th=\re=20\rrun. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the=\r=20\rcoaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten=\r=20\rafter the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives=\r.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some --- =\rbe=20\rrealistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and=\r=20\rlosing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has=\r=20\rsaid \"the other team just wanted it more\" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20\rMitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a=\rnd=20\rNebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? =\rOr=20\ris it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might =\r=20\rfor Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20\r=09??? Mike Engelman=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell=\ring.=20\rWhen Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und=\rer=20\rthe new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams=\r=20\rlike Nebraska (19998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(19998) and won. But now that T=\rexas=20\ris the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20\rBrown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure=\r=20\rthere, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with=\r=20\reverything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti=\rng=20\rstar players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b=\re=20\rexpected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h=\re=20\rhas to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th=\re=20\rSooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have=\r=20\rall come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT=\r=20\rhad to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (=\rhad=20\rbeen beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott=\ron=20\rBowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT=\r=20\rin 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop=\re=20\rof fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over=\r=20\rTexas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma=\rke=20\rhis team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership=\r=20\ramong players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20\rconstantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]\r=09Greg Davis=20\r=09\r=09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20\rthoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is=\r=20\rthe fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are=\r=20\roffensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20\rbetter defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last=\r=20\rseven games (including this one) we have played against \"good\" defenses=20\r(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&amp;M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible=\r.=20\rWe have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank\r=09\r=09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (1112th in th=\re=20\rcountry in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 999th i=\rn=20\rthe country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20\rconservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag=\re=20\rwhen facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20\rcredit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur=\re=20\rto see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on=\r=20\rthis prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa=\rs=20\ron Saturday!   Thanks,=20\r=09??? Lane=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi=\rt=20\rmore. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down=\r,=20\rand some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20\rthere. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20\ryanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20\rplays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20\rtendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20\ranymore.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, =\rno-=20\rhuddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20\ralive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo=\rr =20\rApplewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford=\r, =20\rthe team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense =\r=20\rdid not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=\r =20\rwhen the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why=\r=20\rnot   use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20\rbelieve   with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a=\rll=20\rwould   love to see a consistent running game.=20\r=09??? Brian Gannon=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: \"The=\r=20\rone-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau=\rse=20\rit's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against=\r=20\rusing it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosop=\rhy=20\rof being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass.\"=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09Q:The OU game was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish with no=\r=20\rredeeming features   whatsoever which sets the program back at least a year,=\r=20\rif not more. So tell us something good, Chip ... PLEASE! =20\r=09??? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the dri=\rver's=20\rseat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas=20\rdoesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear=\r=20\rhangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. F=\ror=20\revery 19998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fal=\rl=20\rinto place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects o=\rf=20\rthe OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. =\rIf=20\rUT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedu=\rle=20\rto get to the A=02?game with only one league loss. Let's see what happens.=\r=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:You stated that every QB would benefit from a redshirt year unless the=\ry=20\rwere Michael Vick. Michael Vick redshirted at Virginia Tech and benefited=\r=20\rgreatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it=\r=20\rlast year.=20\r=09??? Brad Livingston=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I stand corrected. But even in my error, I proved my point. I sai=\rd all=20\rfreshmen benefit from a redshirt year, and Chris Simms probably would have,=\r=20\rtoo. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for=\r=20\rsetting the record straight.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the=\r=20\rreceivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely=\r=20\rcoincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but=\r=20\rApplewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run=\r=20\ron all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance=\r=20\rto win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and=20\ropponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surel=\ry=20\rif Simms lives up to his pedigree as everyone hopes, he wouldn't have his=\r=20\rfeelings hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to him.=20\r=09??? Brandon May=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: Simms said this week that if the coaches went solely with Applewh=\rite,=20\rhe could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has=\r=20\rbeen pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his=\r=20\rplay. He said the grade he would give himself this season would be terrible=\r.=20\rBut he says, in his heart, he believes he will show everyone the promise th=\rat=20\rhas been expected of him since leaving high school as the nation's top QB=\r=20\rprospect.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:What role is Courtnee Garcia playing this year on the football team? I=\rs=20\rMiguel McKay on the football team?=20\r=09??? Poorun Patel, Lufkin=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the=\r=20\rpre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And=\r=20\rhe lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin=\rd=20\rNathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince=\r=20\rthe coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make th=\re=20\rmost of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's=\r=20\rposition) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the=\r=20\rteam and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting=\r=20\rrestraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recrui=\rts=20\rthat Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4=\r=20\ryears as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered =\rup=20\rby some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the=\r=20\rnext. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive=20\rtackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where=\r=20\rthe actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would=\r=20\rguess that it has something to do with getting \"senior\" performance from=20\runderclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I=\r=20\rdon't know. What do you think?=20\r=09??? Kevin P. McCarthy=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with t=\rhe=20\rschedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without=\r=20\rlosing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star=\r=20\rhigh school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr=\rom=20\rthen on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1=\r0=20\rand expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving=\r=20\rcorps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the=\r=20\rO-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have=\r=20\rall its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will los=\re=20\rtwo first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcu=\rs=20\rTubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership=\r=20\rin other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors=\r.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the=\r=20\roffense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland=20\rOwls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's=\r=20\rsemi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final=\r=20\rgame. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams? =20\r=09??? Tyrance \"Duke\" Barnett, Garland, Texas=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importan=\rtly,=20\rtheir leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack=\r=20\rBrown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to =\rbe=20\rand play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be=20\routstanding, in my opinion.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the Q=\rB=20\rsituation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of t=\rhe=20\rmost confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my=20\ropinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps=\r=20\rin the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can=\r=20\rsay what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would=\r=20\rnot have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the=20\rentire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to th=\re=20\rlevel they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB=\r=20\rcontroversy creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved. T=\rhe=20\rcoaches, media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity, all=\r=20\rthe while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to prove=\r=20\rhe should be the starter. Mack Brown's job is to be above that, and it's ti=\rme=20\rfor him to take the heat. The media and fans are touching on this, but I=20\rthink it's time to tell it like it is with his illogical, failed and unfair=\r=20\rexperiment.=20\r=09??? Jason Stone=20\r=09\r=09BROWN: Amen, Jason. You have spoken, and the rotation has come to an end=\r.

ABC has opted to use its 6-day window to determine which=\r=20\rgames it will televise that weekend. Right now, it's possible that the game=\r=20\rcould be at 2:30 p.m., 6 p.m. or 1 p.m. It definitely will not be at 111 a.m=\r.=20\rStay tuned.=20\r=09\r=09\r=09If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscrib=\re,=20\rsign up at:   Newsletter Registration=20\r=09\r=09To find or change your password, modify your account, or unsubscribe fro=\rm=20\rthis newsletter, go to:   Newsletter Registration =20\r=09\r=09Questions?

We are more mature. We understand more.

What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20\r=09 ??? Waxer, Dallas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and=\r=20\rTexas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=\r a=20\rgood chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20\rwould start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th=\ren=20\rthe focus would turn to the south end.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Kalen Thornton =20\r=09\r=09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20\r=09??? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=\r Carl=20\rReese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron=\r=20\rwould be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas=\r=20\rwants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20\rThornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20\rconsidering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv=\re=20\rtackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see=\r=20\rplaying time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future =\rby=20\rholding him out this season.=20\r=09\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=\r =20\rsecond half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a   question=\r=20\rabout the punt team.=20\r=09\r=09It's obvious that opposing teams'   philosophy is to not call \"fair catch=\r.\" I=20\rfirst noticed this against   Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that=\r=20\rmaking an early tackle by   invading the \"halo\" and receiving a 5-yard penal=\rty=20\ris much better than   sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.\r=09\r=09But if we're going to   get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po=\rp the=20\rreceiver in the   mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would=\r=20\rmake that   penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20\r=09??? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t=\rhe=20\rpenalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor=\rth=20\rand give that returner something to remember for next time.=20\r=09\r=09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that=\r=20\ragainst a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20\rAllen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the=\r=20\r5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.=\r=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl=\rick.=20\rDid something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I=\r=20\ram out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20\r=09??? Jerry Secrets=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g=\rame.=20\rThe running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking=\r=20\rangles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl=\ray=20\rside was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the=\r=20\rteam had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last=\r=20\rSaturday, it did.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20\r=09??? Rick Bush, Dallas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s=\rtill=20\rseen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h=\re=20\rand the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi=\rgh=20\rankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o=\rne=20\rwants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return=\r=20\rwas premature.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Josh Heupel =20\r=09\r=09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar=\ry can=20\ranswer the call? =20\r=09 ??? Marty Wagner=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=\rs.=20\rUT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20\rsecondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20\r=09\r=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=\rs=20\rback, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=\r=20\rfree safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=\r=20\rin this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=\r=20\rpossible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20\rD-backs.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the =\rkeys?=20\r=09??? Sara Wilson=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=\rys=20\rthe best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=\r=20\rRogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=\r=20\rof the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=\rer=20\rpicking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=\r=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex=\ras,=20\rdo you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=\r?=20\rAlso (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=\r),=20\rdo you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=\re=20\rIF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20\r=09\r=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=\r=20\rApplewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =\rhe=20\robviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=\rck=20\rat the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=\r't=20\rseen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20\r=09 ??? Clint Mickey=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=\rons=20\rwith the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20\rdoesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=\rt=20\ror all of the next two games.=20\r=09\r=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=\r=20\rbecause UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=\r=20\rbe winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).   So, these next two games are=\r all=20\rabout experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=\r=20\rMissouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20\rhaving two starting quarterbacks.=20\r=09\r=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=\r had=20\rbeen the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=\rt=20\rplayer in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=\rhe=20\rbest QB on your own team.=20\r=09\r=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20\rcontinue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20\rseason. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms=\r=20\rgets injured.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Major Applewhite =20\r=09\r=09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi=\rte=20\rhas established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. =\rIt=20\rhas become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks \"starters\" and insist on=20\rtoken starts for Chris Simms.=20\r=09\r=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=\r THE=20\rstarter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead=\r=20\rof allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w=\rho=20\rthen plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =\rAs=20\rfine as Simms' =20\r=09\r=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.   Any comments? =20\r=09??? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=\r=20\rrealize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi=\ron=20\rof confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=\rd=20\rhalf against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20\rrotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20\rmaintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=\rnt=20\rsuccess after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=\rd=20\ris why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20\rsuperior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really=\r=20\rhurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =\r=20\r=09??? Chad Dieterichs=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w=\ray=20\rtoo much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20\rmatter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses=\r=20\ronto Stockton's pocket?=20\r=09\r=09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t=\rhat=20\rthey use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams=\r=20\rare prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit=\r=20\rspecial teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20\rveterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20\r=09\r=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=\ro=20\rhave a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He=\r=20\rsaid he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=\ras=20\rthe result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the=\r=20\rassignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=\rgh=20\rthe middle of the line.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re=\ralize=20\rwhat this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20\rwonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20\rO-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20\r=09\r=09Guess what? Most of these \"great\" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=\r a=20\rfreshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=\rth=20\rcurrent players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =\ror=20\rtwo this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no=\r=20\rbiggie.=20\r=09\r=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=\rill=20\rit take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=\r=20\rprograms? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=\r=20\rwe're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20\rdirection, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=\r=20\rtrue Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20\r=09??? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=\rt.=20\rThe talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=\rs=20\rhas to have experience, and there have to be some \"Braveheart\"-type leaders=\r=20\ron the team.=20\r=09\r=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=\r=20\rseniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=\r=20\rSo the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=\r=20\rcouple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=\r=20\rchampionship.=20\r=09\r=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=\rstead=20\rof just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=\r=20\rLonghorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=\ras=20\rwill be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20\r=09\r=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20\rincluded) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20\rState. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20\rrecruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=\r=20\rthe next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =\ras=20\rthe perennial powers.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha=\rve=20\rthe longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at=\r=20\rNEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=\ral=20\rhelp? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel=\r=20\rguilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20\r=09??? Arland Bishop=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating =\rback=20\rto a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak =\rin=20\rthe nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20\r=09\r=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =\rThe=20\ronly non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games=\r=20\rare New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=\rdo=20\rin Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=\re=20\rField.=20\r=09\r=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=\r be=20\ranother reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20\robviously on the horizon.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=\rd=20\rthis view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=\r=20\rearly in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=\r).=20\rThey were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20\rbarely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=\r=20\rand let him do his magic.=20\r=09\r=09It was like night and day.   Basically, what they did was abandon their m=\rore=20\rbalanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=\rly=20\rand often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=\r=20\r=09\r=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=\rm.=20\rThe only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=\rht=20\rwhen Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=\r=20\rstraight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=\rat=20\rleast the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=\r=20\rprobably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=\r=20\rin the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=\r=20\rfar).=20\r=09\r=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=\r has=20\rdone it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20\rNebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20\rone-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=\r -=20\rhis mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=\re=20\rshotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=\rk=20\rwith him. =20\r=09??? Aaron Ruhnow=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=\rfic=20\rsituations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=\r=20\rthat can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=\r=20\rused it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=\rn=20\rdo a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go=\ring=20\rto be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling=\r.=20\rIf he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops=\r=20\rthis year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20\r=09??? Mike McDonald=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso=\rn and=20\rworks really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove=\rr=20\rhim and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he=\r=20\rsenses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering=\r=20\revery question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remark.=20\r=09\r=09He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know. He has reshaped the=\r=20\rmindset of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to the=\r=20\rfootball team. Games are selling out. Players are coming to Austin. The kid=\rs,=20\rfor the most part, are good kids.=20\r=09\r=09There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega=\rtive=20\rvoices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made=\r.=20\rIf he moves on, the media and the critics will move on, too. If he harps on=\r=20\rcriticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers, the media has no=20\ralternative but to report it. It becomes a wicked circle.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: David Aaron was a receiver that came out of Marshall a few years bac=\rk. I=20\rknow he also went to UT for track but he was a great receiver in high schoo=\rl.=20\rI saw him on the sidelines a few times but he never got much playing time. =\rI=20\rwas thinking he should be a senior this year. Do you know what ever happene=\rd=20\rto him?=20\r=09??? Jeff, Marshall, Texas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Aaron is just running track this year. He has left the football=\r=20\rteam.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is it just me , or does the football field look a little bit torn up=\r? It=20\rjust looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown up.=20\r=09??? Mark V.=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team=\r=20\rpractices on the field on Thursdays. But, I agree. I think the field looks=\r=20\rworse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea=\rm=20\rpracticed on it last year, too).=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=\r have=20\rbeen getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii=\r=20\rgame to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in=\r=20\rthe U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high=\r=20\rschool stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football=\r=20\rgame.\r=09\r=09I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge=\rtting=20\rdrilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems=\r=20\rlike everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20\rsomething negative to heap on the program.\r=09\r=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =\rhis=20\rcoaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=\rh=20\rthe media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted=\r=20\rabout their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do=\r=20\ryou have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20\r=09??? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth=\ring=20\rup, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20\rstorybook season of 19998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t=\roo=20\rbig of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t=\ro=20\rburst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20\rre-evaluated and said, \"Wait, they really aren't that good.\"\r=09\r=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=\rn the=20\rstar falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan=\rt=20\rto add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =\rin=20\rthe foundation to bring up.=20\r=09\r=09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat=\re and=20\rthen when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some=\r=20\rbad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20\ritself. But inevitably there is a settling period.\r=09\r=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we=\r=20\rbelieved will calm down and there will be another story to cover. Plus, Tex=\ras=20\rmay get hot, win all of its games, and then this brief bout of criticism wi=\rll=20\rhave been for naught. But sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h=\ris=20\rteam. He can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going. We'll=\r=20\rsee how Mack Brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things from=20\rhere. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms would have benefited from a redshirt year? =\rI=20\rrealize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not an=20\roption, but I look back at Major Applewhite and it appears to me he benefit=\red=20\rfrom a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn the=20\rsystem. When he came in as a redshirt freshman, he was ready to go. Thanks=\r=20\rfor your insightful newsletter. =20\r=09??? Michael R. Johnson, Houston, Texas =20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Sure, I think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless =\rthey=20\rare Michael Vick. There was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo=\rr=20\rSimms, however. Simms wants to spend just four years in college, and UT=20\rcoaches needed a backup for Applewhite. There is no question Applewhite=20\rbenefited from his redshirt season.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I'm really sick of all this negative stuff from a vocal minority of=\r=20\rfair-weather fans. They sound like a bunch of whining Aggies.=20\r=09\r=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=\rem=20\rwith our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim=\r=20\rNunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20\rcoming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =\rof=20\rhaving actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=\r=20\rboth Marshall and UT.=20\r=09\r=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=\r=20\rconcern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=\r=20\rbut does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20\rcountry? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=\rne=20\rrecruits we have committed for next year?=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=\rhe=20\roffensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's=\r=20\rtime to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching=\r=20\rthis line when it beat Nebraska last year, so let's give him some time to=\r=20\rwork with these guys.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: What's the scoop on playing UH at Robertson Stadium next year? Can T=\rexas=20\r(a la Hawaii) threaten to cancel the game with Houston unless it is played =\rin=20\rthe Astrodome or Rice Stadium? Also, how can either school afford to give u=\rp=20\rthe lost revenue that would result from a Robertson Stadium game, even if=\r=20\rthey do put in an extra 10,000 temporary seats?=20\r=09??? Chris Barbee, El Campo, Texas =20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   This is a price Texas will pay for trying to rekindle some semb=\rlance=20\rof an old Southwest Conference matchup. After UT canceled the Hawaii game, =\rI=20\rdoubt they will actively seek to change next year's schedule. It will be an=\r=20\rintimate setting, shall we say.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I live in Odessa and I use to see Roy Williams do punt returns. Why =\rnot=20\rlet   him return some punts?=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un=\rtil=20\rat least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20\rfreshmen anymore. So, perhaps after mid-season, if UT is not making any=20\rprogress on punt returns, we'll see some new faces back there. I would love=\r=20\rto see what Williams can do, although I doubt that coaches would put him ba=\rck=20\rthere. And I would really like to see Nathan Vasher back there. Heck, I wou=\rld=20\rlike to see Nathan Vasher everywhere. From what I have seen, the kid is=20\rfearless with tons of confidence. We'll see.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Before the UT/Oklahoma State game, I thought that Mack Brown would s=\rtart=20\rshuffling the quarterbacks less often - giving them a quarter or two instea=\rd=20\rof two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of=\r=20\rconsistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I=\rn=20\rthe game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,=\r=20\rand Applewhite played until well into the fourth quarter. The TV announcers=\r=20\reven wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=\r =20\rin until late in the game.=20\r=09\r=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=\r=20\rearly performance? Or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv=\re=20\rApplewhite the reigns? It certainly appears that the coaches have more=20\rconfidence in Applewhite based on the situations they put him in. =20\r=09??? Rick Highfill. Naperville, Ill.=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I sincerely think that the coaches have been trying to give Sim=\rms=20\revery chance to thrive and possibly win the job. After four games, it's cle=\rar=20\rhe hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=\rn=20\ris really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will=\r=20\rrely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=\rir=20\rown theories about having two starters.=20\r=09\r=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =\ryou=20\rsay you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=\rw=20\ronly have one starter. I think the coaches will continue to say they have t=\rwo=20\rstarters and play Simms out of fear of an injury affecting Applewhite. I=20\rdon't know if that's the right answer. Applewhite grew on the job without a=\rny=20\rgame training before Richard Walton went down in 19998. So who knows?=20\r=09\r=09I would think the coaches will again rotate after the OU and Colorado ga=\rmes=20\rbecause they will face teams (Missouri, Baylor, Texas Tech and Kansas) that=\r=20\rthey will probably be favored to beat. At that point, if you're UT, you jus=\rt=20\rhope that the rotation doesn't hurt the team's offensive progress heading=\r=20\rinto the A=02?game and post-season.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is there a start time for the Colorado game? And will it be on TV?=\r=20\r=09??? Marcus Phillips=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The Colorado game will be at 2:30 p.m. Central time on Oct. 14.=\r But=20\rthe game will NOT be on TV. Not even on pay-per-view. If you want to see th=\ris=20\rone, you gotta get out to Boulder.=20\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09 If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri=\rbe,=20\rsign up at:   Newsletter Registration=20\r=09\r=09To find or change your password, modify your account, or unsubscribe fro=\rm=20\rthis newsletter, go to:   Newsletter Registration =20\r=09\r=09Questions?

They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hope=\rs=20\rhave usually come crashing down.=20\r=09\r=09 Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=\r and=20\r19994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or=\r=20\rlosses (1985 and 19994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=\r=20\rlosses. =20\r=09\r=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 19990 and a 10-2=\r-1=20\rrun in 19995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=\r=20\rrespectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20\rLonghorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20\r=09\r=09=20\r=09\r=09\r=09Longhorn Q &amp; A=20\r=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=\rast=20\rseason) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =\ris=20\ralso no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=\re=20\rbest way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20\roffense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=\r=20\rus. =20\r=09\r=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=\rest=20\rathletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=\rd=20\rplayers, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=\r=20\rability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=\rrt=20\rRoy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=\r=20\rplay a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=\rnd=20\rHodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20\rthrough the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=\r=20\rmiss in the open field.=20\r=09\r=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=\rback.=20\rMajor Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=\r=20\rprobably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=\re=20\rto display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=\r=20\rwe are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20\rslipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20\r=09 ??? The Jackson residence=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=\r -=20\rchange coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=\rng=20\rthis team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=\ro=20\rmuch change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=\r=20\rthis Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=\r=20\rresolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=\r=20\rthe positions where problems currently exist. In 19996, Texas was No. 6 and=\r=20\rNotre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=\ren=20\rlost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=\r=20\rOklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=\r=20\ropponent, Houston.=20\r=09\r=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =\rwas=20\rthat Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=\r=20\rloss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=\re=20\rto show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20\rcould go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=\rrd=20\rteam to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=\rns=20\rare not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=\r=20\rhis team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=\re=20\rscrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20\rbeing thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. Bu=\rt=20\rchanges will have to be made constructively and gradually.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Chris Simms =20\r=09\r=09Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?=20\r=09??? Mitch Golding=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start=\r=20\rbecause he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=\r=20\rtrend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=\r=20\rsee how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =\rin=20\rhis play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20\rmiraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see=\r=20\rwhat Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20\r=09\r=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20\r=09\r=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=\rk=20\rBrown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=\r=20\rhis experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =\rHe=20\rsaid they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to =\rme=20\rthat it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, lig=\rht=20\rit up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watc=\rh=20\rlike everyone else. =20\r=09\r=09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=\rna=20\rwith success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)=\r,=20\rBrown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t=\ro=20\rprepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and=20\rApplewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,=\r=20\ryou also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the=\r=20\rquarterbacks against Stanford?=20\r=09??? Nels Marshall=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Here are Brown's exact words: \"Experience. We were in a tight=\r=20\rfootball game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was pro=\rud=20\r- even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that =\rwe=20\rdidn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job=\r=20\rof coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look=\r=20\rlike it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too har=\rd=20\rand get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday=\r=20\rnight, it is one of those things that you have to grow from.\" =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha=\rving=20\rany problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a=20\rleft-handed or right-handed QB?=20\r=09??? Dave Stastny, Austin=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=\ring=20\rthe ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little=\r=20\rfaster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea=\rr.=20\rWhat are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=\r=20\rthat a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al=\rso=20\rapply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount =\rof=20\rtime? =20\r=09??? Chad Graham=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d=\roes=20\rnot suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20\rwindow. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Jermain Anderson =20\r=09\r=09Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b=\rack=20\rto linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa=\rs=20\rCity. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the=\r=20\rnecessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be bett=\rer=20\rsuited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the=20\rprogress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and=\r=20\rAdam Doiron. =20\r=09 ??? Micah Hurt=20\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. =\rThey=20\rare pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's=20\rinstincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop t=\rhe=20\rrun.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn=\r=20\rfootball schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard=\r=20\rTexan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h=\ras=20\rremained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner=\r=20\rfans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging abo=\rut=20\rthe Longhorns. =20\r=09??? Barbara and Mark Harper=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20\r=09\r=09Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox\r=09Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 111 a.m. on ABC\r=09Oct. 7 (in Dallas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA\r=09Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA\r=09Oct. 21 (home) vs. Missouri, TBA\r=09Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA\r=09Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA\r=09Nov. 111 at Kansas, TBA\r=09Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas A=02?at 2:30 p.m. on ABC=20\r=09Since you all have access to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site=\r=20\r(texassports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your=\r=20\rarea.

Thanks.=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players =\rin=20\rthe NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For=20\rexample, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa=\r=20\rBay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and=\r=20\rDallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota=20\rVikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted.

Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=\r=20\rHowever, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team \"up\" sometime=\rs=20\rand can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20\r=09\r=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =\rfor=20\rthe offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=\re,=20\rI put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=\r=20\rMitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=\r=20\rlove Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,3000-plus yards last year, but how many of=\r=20\rthose yards were \"move=20\r=09\r=09 the chains\" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=\r and=20\rprotect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=\r=20\rall we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=\re=20\rrun and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20\r=09\r=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=\r=20\rtackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=\rhe=20\rlinebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=\r=20\rwith Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=\r=20\rreceiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.\r=09\r=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=\re=20\ragainst Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=\r=20\rmay have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=\r=20\rwith opponent's wideouts.\r=09\r=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=\r all=20\rover the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=\rs=20\rup with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does=20\rStockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=\rn=20\ranyone at UT block?\r=09\r=09Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several tim=\res=20\rthe camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru=\rn=20\rup the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll pla=\ry=20\ragainst?=20\r=09??? Andrew Bowen=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20\rincredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=\r's=20\revents. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=\r=20\rthe team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=\r=20\rother part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20\rlearning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20\r=09\r=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=\rnd=20\rneeded time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20\rfullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=\ry=20\risn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=\rd=20\rbeat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=\rs,=20\rand Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=\r=20\rabout whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=\rd=20\ron straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=\rhe=20\rteam.=20\r=09\r=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=\r=20\rquarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=\r=20\rworking hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=\rs=20\rno question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=\r=20\rthe receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=\r=20\rline. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20\rApplewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=\r=20\r=09\r=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =\rwas=20\rtaking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=\r=20\rthat. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20\rdeep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20\rblitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20\rHayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20\r=09\r=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=\r=20\rgames after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=\r=20\rThe defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=\r=20\rReese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=\re=20\rwho can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=\rut=20\rthat position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=\r=20\rone player, who blocked perfectly on 111 other punts Saturday night, failed =\rto=20\rblock a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=\rer=20\rhas been chewed out every which way.\r=09\r=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=\rn,=20\rwho did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=\ry=20\ranything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=\r=20\rhave a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=\r=20\rearly will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20\rconstructively or destructively.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=\r. I=20\rknow he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player =\rin=20\rthe country in 19998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against=\r=20\rteams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. M=\ry=20\rquestion is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker=\r=20\rwhere he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized=\r=20\rand average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our=20\rrecruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!=20\r=09??? Ernie McAnally=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first lov=\re.=20\rBut he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=\rd=20\rright away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) i=\rs=20\rperfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=\rn=20\rtime, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But the=\rre=20\ris no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big play=\rs=20\ragainst Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and=20\rblocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=\rnd=20\rthe next two years, he should only get better.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the=\r=20\rannouncers   stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign f=\ror=20\rLaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20\rWilliams' run for the Heisman?=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few=\r=20\rpostcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national=20\rmedia detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than=\r=20\r$10,000, according to UT officials.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayette =\rgame=20\rplay in the Stanford game? I am watching to see which ones might be=20\rredshirts. =20\r=09??? Mike Smith, Houston=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   According to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-T=\rexas=20\rgame, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh=\ro=20\rdid not play against Louisiana-Lafayette. In addition to Sendlein, here are=\r=20\rthe other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Williams, B.J.

Since UT has lost=\r=20\rfour out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week=20\rofficially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his=\r=20\rabundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5=20\rrecruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie=\rs=20\rto go with those recruiting victories. =20\r=09??? T. Hough=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i=\rn=20\rstints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20\rAppalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20\rprograms. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i=\rn=20\rthe Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl gam=\res=20\rin his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20\r=09\r=09A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20\rfaithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot=\r=20\rseat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he ha=\rs=20\rdone beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi=\rs=20\rfirst two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination=20\rschool for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In=20\raddition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight tha=\rn=20\rprobably most Texas fans realize.=20\r=09\r=09Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd C=\rarr,=20\rSteve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in t=\rhe=20\reyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha=\rt.=20\rUNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,=\r=20\reven when they won big.

Marty Bonner=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffe=\rred=20\ragainst Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game.

Mark Wilson=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Yes. Williams' No. 34 will be retired at that game.

Virginia Blair=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Again, here are Mack's words: \"I said during the pre-season tha=\rt we=20\rwere overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished=\r=20\rlast year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a=\r=20\rTop 5 football team.

It contains video showing=20\rRicky breaking about 10 records, a panoramic tour of the UT football=20\rfacilities, Ricky Williams personal scrapbooks, his rings and trophies in 3=\rD,=20\rand a few other notable features. Unfortunately the company that produced t=\rhe=20\rCD-ROM (called Run Ricky!) has gone out of business due to the fact the NCA=\rA=20\rwould not allow the company to release the title during the summer. But the=\r=20\rCD-ROM is still available at the Texas co-op and Longhorns Ltd. at=20\rDKR-Memorial.=20\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09=20\r=09Longhorn Q &amp; A=20\r=09 Q: What is the start time for the Texas-Oklahoma game?=20\r=09 ??? Sanford Gaines=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The Texas OU-game is 111 a.m. Oct. 7 at the Cotton Bowl in Dalla=\rs.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Ivan Williams =20\r=09\r=09Q: Last year, the coaches raved about Ivan Williams and almost took off =\rhis=20\rredshirt. Now, a year later, he hasn't gotten a sniff at real playing time =\rat=20\rtailback. What happened to tailback by committee? It seems like we could us=\re=20\ra bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).=20\r=09??? Bob Nance=20\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the=\r=20\rHouston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more=20\rcarries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness=20\rneeded to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought =\rhe=20\rwas running tentatively.=20\r=09\r=09Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut =\rloose=20\rthis week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three=20\rgames, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week=\r=20\ris the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to =\rdo=20\rit against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yar=\rds=20\rper game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,=\r=20\ryielding 47.0 ypg). I think it will be tough sledding for the UT RBs this=\r=20\rweek. Should be a good passing game, though.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calli=\rng on=20\roffense, and feel that Texas can never win a national championship with Gre=\rg=20\rDavis as offensive coordinator. Any comments?=20\r=09??? Reggie Reeves=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the=\r=20\rnation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT =\ris=20\rfourth nationally in pass offense (3666.5 yards per game). The running game=\r=20\rstinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback=20\rrotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms fr=\rom=20\rpeaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.=20\r=09\r=09Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The=\r=20\rBroncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.=20\rDavis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles=\r=20\rto the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,=\r=20\rthe quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love=\r=20\rhim. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.\r=09\r=09Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staf=\rf in=20\rthe near future for a head job or head coordinator job in the NFL, it's Gre=\rg=20\rDavis.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited abou=\rt=20\rthis year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the=20\rfootball. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied=\r=20\rthat the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but=\r=20\rthey are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the seas=\ron=20\rwith running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it =\ris=20\rstill a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caug=\rht=20\rup in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.=20\r=09\r=09Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT =\rgoing=20\r8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. Th=\rey=20\rare still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against=\r=20\rreally bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient=\r=20\rthis year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my=\r=20\rdays at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em! =20\r=09??? Larry, Dallas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's sh=\rown=20\rthis season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third=20\rpossession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two=\r=20\rguys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to g=\ro=20\runtouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.=\r=20\r=09\r=09This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has b=\reen=20\rsick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected=\r=20\rcyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman=\r=20\rHolloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett=\rer=20\rin the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while=\r=20\rfor them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,=\r=20\rhowever, may be too late against a good team.=20\r=09\r=09The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line t=\ro=20\rhave any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that=20\rappears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory=\r=20\rQuye), two juniors (Antwan Kirk-Hughes, Matt Anderson) and a sophomore=20\r(Derrick Dockery). =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: How frustrated is Chris Simms with his lack of playing time? In the=\r=20\roff-season I kept hearing about how most of the players were really impress=\red=20\rwith the passing abilities of Simms. Are any of the players now questioning=\r=20\rwhy Chris is not playing more than he is?=20\r=09??? Jeff Weaver, Dallas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Simms said this week that the rotation is difficult. But player=\rs=20\rhave not chosen sides. Simms says there are times when he makes a mistake a=\rnd=20\rwould love to go back in and correct it, even though his rotation is up and=\r=20\rMajor Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.=20\r=09\r=09Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series befor=\re=20\rApplewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep=\r=20\rpass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,=\r=20\rhe had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.=20\rJohnson, the safer choice. \"It was the smarter thing to do,\" he said.=20\r=09\r=09My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing ti=\rme as=20\rpossible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come=20\rOklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the=20\rcoaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20\rhot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, wi=\rll=20\rSimms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coach=\res=20\rhave tended to lean on Applewhite whenever it's crunch time.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Major Applewhite =20\r=09\r=09Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is=\r=20\rhaving to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alum=\rs=20\rand parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think wh=\rat=20\ris being done is a ... (I have to say   it) ... a Major Injustice.=20\r=09 ??? A \"Major\" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is=\r=20\rconstantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20\rtime. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20\reveryone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20\r=09\r=09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be=\r=20\rallowed to =20\r=09\r=09compete   for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whet=\rher=20\rChris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20\rdeserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20\r=09\r=09It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's =\ra=20\rbreakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent=20\rcompletion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB=\r=20\rrating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25=\r7=20\ryards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But=\r=20\rBrown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what=20\rSimms can do.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?=20\r=09??? Sara McFadden=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability th=\ris=20\rseason. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20\rcould. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h=\re=20\rlost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20\roffense. But it's almost impossible to know.=20\r=09\r=09The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid.=\r It=20\ris hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and=\r=20\rbreak records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being \"the=\r=20\rman\" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked=\r=20\ronto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play=\r=20\rQB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.=20\r=09\r=09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20\rcoordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for=\r=20\rmore yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide=\rd=20\rto break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense throug=\rh=20\rthree games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor=\re=20\rpassing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=\r 7=20\rin 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (555.3 in=\r=20\r2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 =\rto=20\r1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20\r=09\r=09I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were all=\rowed=20\rto start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h=\re=20\rgot to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20\rproduction is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this=20\rrotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20\rthis. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a=\rll=20\rseason long. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing=20\rdefenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?   In other words, is the=\r=20\roffense too complex so that they don't know their assignments   or are they=\r=20\rsimply being outplayed? =20\r=09 ??? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The offensive linemen, quarterbacks and coaches all say that th=\rey=20\rhave seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games. Coach Mack=\r=20\rBrown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive=\r=20\rschemes that they had shown in previous games.=20\r=09\r=09Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating =\rUT,=20\rso they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against=\r=20\rStanford, UT wasn't good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to =\rUT=20\rpersonnel, the defenses have been new. Now that it's the fourth game of the=\r=20\rseason, one would think there are only so many defenses the O-line hasn't=\r=20\rseen. The excuses are running out.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Ricky Brown =20\r=09\r=09Q: It appears to me that Texas really misses the blocking of Ricky Brown=\r,=20\rboth in the running game and in the blitz pick-up. Who is Texas recruiting =\rto=20\rreplace him? I don't question Matt Trissel's effort, but he just doesn't se=\rem=20\rto be getting it done for Texas. =20\r=09??? Bart Jacobs=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The coaches are recruiting a fullback named James Buchanan of=\r=20\rSarasota, Fla., Cardinal Mooney, who is also being pursued by Florida State=\r=20\rand Florida. But they are happy with Matt Trissel. They say he's young and=\r=20\rneeds a little more time to get adjusted to the fullback position after=20\rexcelling at linebacker in high school. Mack Brown considers Trissel a lead=\rer=20\ron the offense despite his status as a redshirt freshman. He's had some=20\rbotched blocking assignments, but so have all the other backs.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Despite a visit from the nutritionist during the off-season, and a m=\ruch=20\rpublicized weight loss, the offensive line still appears overweight and slo=\rw.=20\rWhat is Jeff Madden doing the rectify this problem? If this problem=20\rpersists, =20\r=09\r=09might Texas be looking to hire a new strength coach? I know Madden is a =\rgood=20\rfriend of Mack Brown's, but production has to be the bottom line, and right=\r=20\rnow, it appears Madden isn't getting it done. I enjoy your newsletter. Than=\rk=20\ryou for your time.=20\r=09??? James Taglienti=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Madden is someone I consider UT's secret weapon. He's much more=\r than=20\ra coach for this team. He works their bodies and minds and can be credited=\r=20\rwith getting this team to believe that it could beat Nebraska back in 19998.=\r=20\rThe players love and respect him even though he works them to the ground.=\r=20\rNone of the breakdowns so far this season can be attributed to Madden.=20\rPhysically, the players are in good shape. Their problems are mental. Madde=\rn=20\ris one of the most valued members of the staff. ?\r=09\r=09 Q: Are there any hopes for a national championship considering the loss=\r to =20\rStanford?=20\r=09??? Liddy Newsome=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Anything is possible. Texas would need Nebraska to remain=20\rundefeated, and then hope the other top 10 teams pick up a loss or two. If=\r=20\rTexas could go unbeaten the rest of the way and beat an undefeated and No. =\r1=20\rNebraska in the Big 12 title game, the Longhorns could possibly get lucky a=\rnd=20\rend up in the Orange Bowl. But that is about as long a shot as Ricky Willia=\rms=20\rsuiting up for UT this Saturday.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I have heard a lot about how much talent Chance Mock has. How does h=\ris =20\rtalent compare to that of Chris Simms? If he wouldn't have redshirted, coul=\rd=20\rhe have beat out Chris or possibly Major Applewhite as the main guy?=20\r=09??? Brett Holmes=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Not a chance. No pun intended. Mock asked to redshirt because h=\re has=20\rmuch to learn and wants to step in after Simms and Applewhite move on.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I think Hodges Mitchell is a good kid, with a good pedigree ... and=\r=20\rthere's the rub. Is Coach Brown too in love with this kid? Is he doing an o=\rld=20\rfriend a favor by keeping this kid in the game? He had a decent season last=\r=20\ryear, especially coming out of the shadow of Ricky Williams, but I have see=\rn=20\rnothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.=20\r=09\r=09I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical \"scat-back=\r,\"=20\rHodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a=\r=20\rquick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.=\r=20\rInstead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the=20\r\"vision\" required of a good running back? I cannot believe that he is that=\r=20\rmuch better than the other running backs on the roster. Are the rest that=\r=20\rbad? There has to be more to the story.=20\r=09??? Roy Cassas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Mitchell apparently needs to be pushed to the brink of losing h=\ris=20\rjob to really find traction. Last year, he was on the verge of losing his j=\rob=20\rto Victor Ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to 1,3000 yards=\r=20\rrushing and 3000 yards receiving. He says he is ready to cut loose, again (i=\rn=20\rthe fourth game, just like last year).   The problem is, Texas is playing=20\rOklahoma State this week, who has the nation's No. 1 defense against the ru=\rn.=20\rLast year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149=\r=20\ryards. We'll see if he can shake the slump he's in. Otherwise, look for Ike=\r=20\rand Kenny Hayter to start getting more of the load.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: In your most recent \"Inside UT Football\" you mentioned that stations=\r on=20\rthe UT football network are listed on the texassports.com Web site. I have=\r=20\ranother suggestion for people such as me who live in other parts of the=20\rcountry, or overseas. I have found that all (I think) NCAA top 25 broadcast=\rs=20\rare carried on http:///sports.yahoo.com/. They carry all NFL radio broadcast=\rs=20\ras well. One of the beauties about this site is that if you don't like one=\r=20\rset of announcers you can usually switch over to those who carry the opposi=\rng=20\rteam. As my grandson would say, \"And that's really cool.\" I enjoy your week=\rly=20\rnewsletter very much. Keep it up. =20\r=09??? Bud Sloan, Reno, Nev.=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Thanks for sharing, Bud. Hope this helps some other folks.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Why does Coach Mack Brown reject criticism with cynicism, yet accept=\r=20\rpraise with zeal? To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while=20\rciting fans as \"... being negative and openly critical ...\" (i.e., four=20\rlosses in five games, 1000 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB=20\rcontroversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,=\r=20\rCoach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites=\r=20\rthe team's emotional psyche as \"... being fragile,\" yet Coach Brown fueled=\r=20\rthis euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.=\r=20\r=09\r=09Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's=\r=20\rmental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown's tenure paralleling the turbule=\rnt=20\rand volatile path taken by rival coach Jackie Sherrill at Texas A=02?(no eg=\ros in=20\rthat one!) during the 1980s? =20\r=09??? David Newburn=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to=\r help=20\rhis players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20\rsensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds=\r=20\rthem that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question=\rs=20\rthe quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ=\re=20\rand contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.   I=\r=20\rhonestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light=\r=20\rthat he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He=\r=20\rforgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20\rpeople get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or=\r=20\rworse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see=\r=20\rStanford).=20\r=09\r=09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public=\r=20\rappearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio=\rn=20\rto UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his=\r=20\rteam. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the=\r=20\rfirst to pick up the team when it's down. Not pile on.=20\r=09\r=09But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, get=\rs 10=20\rpenalties and gives up another blocked punt for a TD. There is no question =\rhe=20\ris still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at Texas.=\r=20\rWhen his team loses a game it shouldn't and plays terribly in doing so, he=\r=20\rwill always hear it from the fans and the press, whether his team is young =\ror=20\rnot.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Why do you suppose the Longhorns are throwing so few really long pas=\rses=20\rthis year? It seems to me doing so would open up the running game like it w=\ras=20\rwhen Ricky Williams was playing.=20\r=09??? Will Vernon=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   They need some more time. The young receivers need a little mor=\re=20\rtime to adjust. But I do think that with the athleticism of the young=20\rreceivers, you will see more short routes that turn into long gains. Once R=\roy=20\rWilliams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson develop some comfort in this offens=\re,=20\rI think you'll see more long pass plays.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I just have two questions that have been frustrating for me this yea=\rr.=20\rThe first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting t=\ro=20\rhave an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes, but=\r=20\rwhy bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why do=\res=20\rHodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20\r=09\r=09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t=\rhe=20\rkicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but=\r=20\rhis average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a=\r=20\rgamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant=\r=20\rminutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20\r=09\r=09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?=\r=20\rHampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your=\r=20\rAll-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn't=\r=20\rthey push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?=20\r=09??? Jeff Wilson=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Brown trusts Mitchell not to get tight and muff a punt return i=\rn=20\rfront of 80,000 people. That's not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I=\r=20\rwould like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he=\r=20\rcan do. Vasher has been fearless in everything I've seen him do. Mitchell=\r=20\rhasn't shown breakaway moves yet. If we don't see it soon, it might be time=\r=20\rto give someone else a shot.=20\r=09\r=09They take Hampton out on nickel situations because they think that Shaun=\r=20\rRogers is the better pass rusher from the tackle position. There has been n=\ro=20\rtalk about moving Rogers to end in pass-rush situations. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Coach Mack Brown appeared to be auditioning for the head coach job a=\rt the=20\rUniversity of Oklahoma in the last minutes of the Houston game. Apparently=\r=20\runsatisfied with a 40-0 lead and two minutes to go, the Horns unloaded a lo=\rng=20\rpass from the arm of Chris Simms who hadn't been able to do anything all=20\rnight. Just when everyone was ready to run the clock out,   Brown, or Simms=\r=20\r(whoever was in charge), elected to do whatever necessary to humiliate our=\r=20\rguests even more by rubbing their noses in it. I, for one, was not very pro=\rud=20\rof being a Texas-ex for the last two minutes of that game. Texas football=\r=20\rtraditions took a hard blow in that   Switzer-like move. Shame.=20\r=09??? Jim Ball, Class of '57, Big Sandy, Texas=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Mack Brown says he had Simms throwing late in the game to get=\r=20\rexperience and live snaps because there could come a time in the future whe=\rre=20\rTexas needs to move the ball late in a game to win, as it needed to do=20\ragainst Stanford.=20\r=09\r=09The pass into the end zone to Sloan Thomas in the waning seconds was a=\r=20\rcheckoff that Chris Simms made. Mack Brown said he wished that Simms hadn't=\r=20\rdone that. But Simms actually made the right read. Simms said he bobbled th=\re=20\rsnap or it would have been a touchdown.=20\r=09\r=09There was a huge outpouring of criticism for having Simms pass the ball =\rwhen=20\rUT needs experience running the ball. What better time to work on running t=\rhe=20\rball than at the end of the game? There is an argument to be made there. Ma=\rck=20\rBrown said his team got criticized for not being able to hold onto the ball=\r=20\rand run out the clock after taking a lead at the end of the Stanford game.=\r=20\rNow, he says he's being criticized for moving the ball at the end of the=20\rHouston game.=20\r=09\r=09\"We get hammered either way,\" Brown said. He added that he wasn't trying=\r to=20\rrun it up on Houston for the chop block that led to Shaun Rogers' injury, a=\rnd=20\rhe wasn't trying to pay back the Cougars for what John Jenkins used to do i=\rn=20\rrunning it up. He said the team was just working to get better.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: What happened to Sneezy Beltran, the much-heralded running back out =\rof =20\rAbilene High?=20\r=09??? Eddie Alvarado=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Beltran has asked to redshirt this season.=20\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09 If you received this newsletter from a friend and would like to subscri=\rbe,=20\rsign up at:   Newsletter Registration=20\r=09\r=09To find or change your password, modify your account, or unsubscribe fro=\rm=20\rthis newsletter, go to:   Newsletter Registration =20\r=09\r=09Questions?

We will be using cbs sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, too early, too late.If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.   You all do not stand a chance!-Eric\n"

      "body": "\nI thought you all might find this an interesting read.   Sorry, the complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed theform is the same that hired there ticketing help.-ETo whom it may concern:I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.   It was wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.   I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/000 for Phoenix and catch a 10:000 AM connection to Telluride (the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).   Unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the Houston area.   I do not blame America West for this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which leads me to the point of this complaint.   Your ticketing staff in IAH was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline (Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that we could make our connection.   Instead, we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this connection.   Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have   delivered us to Phoenix on time.   It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.   I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose, CO where we had to drive 1000 miles to Telluride.   Instead of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten hours later.   This delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation.   Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience.For your research I provide the following data:Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna Husser, and Donnita Franklin.Final Itinerary (after all changes) -Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AMFlt. 62444 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PMFlt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:000AMFlt. 22273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah   1:15PMSincerely,Eric Bass\n"

I know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including flag football) recently.   This is a way that Enron can support employee interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.My questions are : Is this idea plausible?

This is how we read George W. Bush'soff-the-record aside that New York Times reporter Adam Clymer is a \"majorleague\" you-know-what.In that refreshingly incautious remark caught Monday by an open microphone,Mr. Bush was admitting, albeit unintentionally, that his campaign has apress problem. We aren't referring only to Mr. Clymer, whose performancereview has been ably undertaken by neo-liberal journalist Mickey Kaus atkausfiles.com. We're talking about the general media double standard facedby every prominent conservative politician.As Democrat-turned-journalist Michael Barone has observed, the mainstreammedia aren't pro-Democratic. They will sometimes take a Democrat to task,especially if he violates a media shibboleth such as \"campaign-financereform.\" But they are reliably anti-Republican. That is, in newsrooms acrossthe land there is noticeably greater skepticism, and often animosity, towardpoliticians who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the scopeof federal power.This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks. Instead theslant shines through in the press pack's definition of what constitutes newsor the interpretation the pack puts on news. Consider the treatment of threerecent campaign episodes:When Mr. Bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher was\"Christ,\" he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to the\"religious right.\" The implication was that he couldn't possibly mean it.But now Democrat and liberal Joe Lieberman is making a much more frequentand vocal issue of his own religious faith, and the same media that scoldedMr. Bush are writing long, thoughtful treatises on the role of religion inpolitics. And any criticism of Mr. Lieberman is accompanied with the caveatthat the Orthodox Jew really is sincere. This is a double standard.Or take Mr. Bush's recent decision to run a TV spot attacking Mr. Gore'scredibility. This was reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, asgoing \"negative,\" primarily as a response to Mr. Gore's rise in the polls.But what about the weeks-long TV-ad hammering that Democrats have laid onMr. Bush --- for his Texas record, and even during the GOP convention on hisrunning mate's 15-year-old voting record? The Gore attacks were reported aslegitimate subjects of political debate. We happen to think all of these arelegitimate, but only Mr. Bush's got the good-housekeeping media's \"negative\"label.Then there is the debate over Presidential debates. This back and forth is ahardy perennial, and you'd think the press would merely let both sides dukeit out. But in the coverage we've seen, Mr. Bush's proposal to break fromthe Commission on Presidential Debates mold is being treated as an attemptto dodge debates or attract a smaller audience. Mr. Gore's decision torenege on his pledges to debate on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and CNN's \"LarryKing Live\" don't get the same spin.This criticism of Mr. Bush is especially galling when it comes from thelikes of ABC and CBS, who now whine that they won't carry debates held byother networks. So much for their public-spiritedness. Their reaction showsthat the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate votersand more about dividing the commercial TV spoils equally. We hope Mr. Bushsticks with his desire to have a less scripted, more open exchange with Mr.Gore.Mr. Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's mediaproblem better than most other Republicans. Indeed, we've long suspectedthat his \"compassionate conservative\" theme was as much about mediamanagement as policy. It was designed to deflect the inevitable mediaportrayal of any Republican as a heartless, Gingrichian budget cutter. Mr.Bush also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him aboutrumors of youthful drug use.We aren't suggesting that Mr. Bush should get into a pitched battle with thepress corps, and especially not with any one reporter. Our point is that Mr.Bush won't be able to count on even-handed media coverage to carry hisbattle to Mr. Gore. He's going to have to make his case directly, and nottoo subtly, to voters over the heads of the media.That means Mr. Bush would be better off doing more debates in severalforums. And, above all, it means setting his own agenda and strategy, nomatter if ankle-biters in the press corps call it \"negative.\"___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com.Share information about yourself, create your own public profile athttp:///profiles.msn.com.\n"

I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ...\"\r Got the picture.\r OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 1000 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=\rle.\r Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=\rck=20\rChris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20\rSporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=\rek\r This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=\rt=20\rfrom the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=\r=20\rHardin.\r Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.\r Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=\r=20\rwhen he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=\r=20\rDuring rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20\rsport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=\r=20\rfootball games are played under water.\r One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=\rth=20\rrubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=\r=20\rsupporting muscles and improving his balance.\r \"If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20\rbecause he wanted to be challenged,\" Hardin said. \"It was a challenge to co=\rme=20\rup with things to challenge him.\"\r \"The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=\r=20\rup,\" Applewhite said. \"I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=\rr=20\rsix minutes instead of five.\"\r After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=\r=20\rmore on conventional wisdom than necessity.\r \"I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it,\" he said. \"I don't=\r=20\rhave any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason.\"\r In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=\r=20\rwhich being a renewed appreciation for the game.\r \"So what if I'm tired?\" he said. \"I can rest when I die.\"\r Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=\rs=20\rwas a boon for his arm.\r \"I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=\r=20\rit felt like my arm was run ragged,\" he said.\r Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20\rtakes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=\r=20\rwill take a little longer.\r Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?\r \"I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris,\" Hardin said of his=20\roccasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=\r=20\rploy. \"But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever.\"\r \"It's remarkable the way he's come back,\" said sophomore cornerback Roderic=\rk=20\rBabers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=\r=20\rspeediest receivers in workouts. \"In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight.\"\r Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=\r=20\rBabers said, \"I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=\rnd=20\rSimms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=\rut=20\rat the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=\r=20\rall.\"\r \"He's the same old Major,\" cornerback Quentin Jammer said.\r Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=\r=20\rduel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=\r=20\rmonth before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=\rt=20\rcompeting against Simms, just against himself.\r \"The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20\rhave,\" Applewhite said. \"At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=\rer=20\ron the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=\rve=20\rdone the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=\rl.\"\r Simms has bulked up from 208 to 2223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=\rdy=20\rstrength.\r \"I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=\r=20\rblow me over,\" he said. \"I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =\rbe=20\rlike Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =\rhe=20\rhas to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).\r \"It's going to come, and it'll get worse,\" Simms said of the building=20\rscrutiny. \"To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20\rsport. There's nothing you can do about it.\"\r So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=\r=20\rHe's working on his topic for a writing course, \"History of American=20\rBaseball.\" The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.\r In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=\r=20\rsame. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.\r They'll live it.\r   ---=\r---\r---\n"

This year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.   Enron once again had the largest team, breaking the national record with over 4000 riders.   This year, the MS Society expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.   With your support, Enron will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in pledges to date.   Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible disease.   The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.   The race started off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.   Team Enron once again had the privilege of starting first in the race.   Things were going pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear wheel.   Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was completely bent.   I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the first rest stop where they could do the repairs.   Unfortunately, it took me over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.   So much for the early start!The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.   After lunch in Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.   In LaGrange, Enron treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much appreciated after 1000 miles of riding.   The atmosphere in the camp is a lot of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with stories about the day's ride.   The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's famous pancake breakfast.   We needed the carbohydrates because the second day features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.   My legs were a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed up and ready to go.   I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.   For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.   It's actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.   Once we were out of the park, lunch was only a few miles away.   I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.   Only 40 miles left!   After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.   At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the toughest part.   When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck it up and keep going.   They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can feel the anticipation building.   The last mile of the race is packed with people on each side cheering you on.   It's quite a rush when you get to the end.   Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.   What a ride!Thanks again for your support.   Just to let you know, I'll be coming around next week to collect your pledge.   Your contribution is, of course, fully tax deductible.   Enron is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).   Hope to see you in the race next year!BrianP.S.In case you're interested, here are some interesting facts on the race:http:///ms150.org/learnfun.htmPictures of last year's race.   The 2000 pictures should be posted soon:http:///ms150.org/learngallery.htmA map of the race:http:///ms150.org/images/maps/breakl.jpg\n"

The accident occurredas the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck hadburned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the.222 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next tothe steering wheel column.After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properlyand the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After travelingabout 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparentlyoverheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicleswerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but willrequire surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a brokenclavicle and was treated and released.\"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or wemight both be dead\" stated Wallis.\"I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is afirst for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accidenthappened,\" said Snyder.Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogsthe boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.Way to go, Lavinia)&lt;&lt;&lt; J.

It was my impression that the only reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was tenure.   Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this PRC?Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.Eric Bassx3-09777\n"

I need YOUR help to pass this e-mail along to as many friends that you feel would be interested in friendly, competitive flag football.   If you are remotely interested, e-mail me your name and phone number, so I can create a contact list to pass out to everyone.   I don't have any flags or field cones, but if we get enough people interested, I'm sure Enron will sponsor us (if you have flags and/or cones, please bring them; I'll bring the football).The location of our games will be at the practice field, East of the Rice U. stadium (across the parking lot).   I believe our playing field is on Rice University Blvd., between gates 12 and 13.   The field has two field goals and bleachers.   It's hard to miss!I hope everyone is interested.   If not, we didn't need your slow, lazy, unathletic ass anyway...My contact info is 713-345-7594.\n"

Sorry, thecomplaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designedtheform is the same that hired there ticketing help.-ETo whom it may concern:I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.   It waswonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/000 forPhoenix and catch a 10:000 AM connection to Telluride(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).   Unfortunately, theflight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane becauseof foggy conditions in the Houston area.   I do not blame America West forthis; It is understandable to cancel this flight because ofthe danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, nodanger involved in taking off in these conditions, whichleads me to the point of this complaint.   Your ticketing staff in IAH wasless than helpful in re-routing us on another airline(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have deliveredus to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so thatwe could make our connection.   Instead, we were told that it was impossibleto find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for thisconnection.   Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space onflights that would have   delivered us to Phoenix on time.It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of myvacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missedour connection we were forced to spend a combined6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose,CO where we had to drive 1000 miles to Telluride.   Insteadof arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full tenhours later.   This delay caused the waste of one full day ofvacation.   Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline againbecause of this experience.For your research I provide the following data:Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, ShannaHusser, and Donnita Franklin.Final Itinerary (after all changes) -Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AMFlt. 62444 Dec. 09 Phx-Mtj 3:34PMFlt. 6241 Dec. 14 Mtj-Phx 9:000AMFlt. 22273 Dec. 14 Phx-Iah   1:15PMSincerely,Eric Bass\n"

      "body": "\nRedskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback   Sept. 19, 2000By Len PasquarelliSportsLine.com Senior Writer Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, SportsLine.com has confirmed. \"If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not the case,\" coach Norv Turner said. \"But it goes beyond just the quarterback position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general.\"   Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the unbeaten Giants.(AP)   In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that it might be time for a change. One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to tailback Stephen Davis. The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 yards per catch this season. But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new focus more than a new starter. \"There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks),\" he said. \"Right now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere else.\"   \"Bass, Jason\" &lt;Jason.Bass2@COMPAQ.com&lt; on 09/20/2000 08:29:53 AMTo: \"'Eric Bass'\" &lt;Eric.Bass@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: RE: TVJeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 09/19/000Sepculation is increasing that George may get a chance to start after BradJohnson struggled against Dallas.

Corrigan of Richmond, Va.He asks:\"Which conference is best? Pac -0? ACC? SEC? Big 10? Big 12? Big East? Using the RPI, I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference (ACC is the smallest in terms of members, and I threw out their \"Russian judge\" team). If you were to add these individual team RPI up, the least sum would indicate the greatest depth:Big Ten, 178; SEC, 194; Big East, 246; Big 12, 278; ACC, 369; Pac-10, 382.Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams, since half are forced into a losing record. Others say, only one team can win, so why concern yourself with the bottom feeders? To refute that, here's what the sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference:SEC, 40; Pac-10, 41; ACC, 48; Big Ten, 49; Big East, 666; Big 12, 69.If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders, then we want to make sure there are no \"gimmies\" for those teams on top. So what's the RPI rating of the lowest team in each conference?SEC, 103 (LSU); Big Ten, 135 (Northwestern); Big 12, 157 (Texas Tech); Big East, 167 (Virginia Tech); ACC, 168 (Clemson) Pac-10, 173 (Washington State)Others will argue that we should include each team and then \"normalize\" based on the number of teams per conference. This will also account for the small differences between teams and reward second-tier team strength. Here are the conferences with their average RPI and median RPI.SEC (39.1, 38.5), Big Ten (39.4, 29.0), Big East (45.2, 49.0), ACC (59.7, 35.0), Big 12 (666.7, 47.0), Pac-10 (70.8, 555.0).This data clearly shows how \"top heavy\" the ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 are. But who's the best? When evaluating where each conference ranks across the these five categories:SEC: 2-1-1-1-3 8Big Ten: 1-4-2-2-1 10Big East: 1-5-4-3-4 17ACC: 5-3-5-4-2 19Big 12: 4-6-3-5-4 222Pac-10: 6-2-6-6-6 26The SEC has a slight edge over the Big Ten, but some may say the RPI is biased. So how would these numbers hold up using the Sugaring Ratings?SEC: 10Big 10: 111ACC: 12Big 12: 20Pac-10: 222Big East: 29Personally, I think the RPI is a little more accurate. Hope you found this interesting in my attempt to answer the oldest question in the NCAA book. Ideally, I would like to include head-to-head competition and run these numbers, but I'm an amateur and I don't that much time on my hands.\"___Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:///explorer.msn.com\n"

We know that is we passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close these Position Values will be. Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product during bid week? Dale---"

The following meters have transport rates attached to them which are above and beyond the matrix rates Ed quotes to Tom.

Would you let me know if these are the meters for which we are manually moving around money from Tom to Ed for the residential portion of the Lufkin-Diboll volume?I believe that the industrial portion of this volume is included already as part of Ducote's deal, and I believe that the residential portion is volume which you determine and then move from Tom to Ed every month.Is this right?Heidi\n"

I am currently Director of Tax for the Enron India business unit and have been with Enron in various Tax functions for approximately 5 years.   I have been asked to sit on the Enron Corp. Performance Review Committee as PRC Representative for a group of   18 Analysts, including you.   Your 6/2000 performance results will be presented to the PRC on 19-July PRC, along with all other Analysts.   I want to make certain we both take full advantage of the PRC process.   To that end, I need you to bring me up-to-speed on your pre-Enron background and what you have accomplished while at Enron, in particular during the 6/2000 review period, and what you intend to accomplish this year (your \"goals\").   With this information, I can be best prepared to speak of your achievments during the 19-July PRC presentation.   Here's what I need -resume (most recent is fine,   even if out of date)name of your \"PRC Supervisor\" ( i.e., the person who has gathered your 6/2000 Feedback)location and phone extensionyour goals for the 2000 year (if these were not formalized, I would appreciate your doing so)accomplishments this review period (especially toward achievement of your stated goals)outside activities which support the community, especially those where your represent \"Enron\" (e.g., charitable endeavors)other activities you are involved in which support \"Enron\" as a whole (e.g., college recruiting)One last thing, please forgive the somewhat impersonal use of email.   I would like to meet you in person and hope that we can arrange that early next week.   Would you be available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon (111/12-July) for 30 minutes?   We could use that time to run through your background materials.Please furnish the name of your \"PRC Supervisor\" by email ( my list indicates it is Tom Martin ) so that   I can contact them for a copy of the business unit PRC materials that should have recently been completed for you.Thanks for your help ...

It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a&lt; servant, he could take a second wife.&lt;   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is&lt; affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the&lt; directorate --- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for&lt; mosques --- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include&lt; expanded roles and rights for women.&lt;   \"I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with&lt; money women paid in taxes,\" said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group&lt; promoting women in politics.&lt;   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim mancould&lt; beat his wife --- and included tips and instructions --- although it&lt; counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbalabuse.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

As a result those two deals have not bridged to CPR and will remain like this until you provide the necessary curve information listed below.   If you will need to create new curves and that will take a while, let me know if you want me to map this location to some existing curves in the meantime, so it will at least bridge to CPR.

When I have to put up with that lack of respect from you on a daily basis, I consider it below the belt.   I would have liked to keep this to the game, but for some reason you always add the bit about EES.   Besides, don't throw Brenda choosing between you and Heidi in my face.   That doesn't add much credibility.Between friends,   life and work are not constant competitions to see who's smarter or who makes more money.   I was genuinely happy for you when you decided to stay on at the desk.   As a matter of fact, I remember giving you advice, as a friend, on that very subject.   I hold no resentment or jealousy that you got it and I didn't.   I wouldn't have taken it anyway.   I neither liked my job in risk or felt that I was exceptional at it.   But, I did it well enough to bide time and move on to something that I'm more suited for.   My move to EES wasn't a banishment, but a choice.   It was a risk that paid off very well.   Of course you are better at what you do than I.   But I seriously doubt you could be as effective as I am in front of a Customer or managing a project.   It's all about what you do well and being happy with that.   I'm glad we both are, but attempting to make me or my position less important because I don't work on the trading floor is just typical ENA arrogant bullshit...And you have no history about getting hammered and hooking up with skanks (i.e. Indian Princess.)

Or you can email me---for some reason I   didn't get your email until 5:30 today and it looks like you sent it during   lunch.

Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.   Do you think that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's tax cuts going to the \"wealthiest one percent\".   That is the biggest load of garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country.   So, if there is an across the board tax cut, obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.-E\n"

Because so many players are relatively close in terms of talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several projections we'll have on ESPN.com. \tA number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing in Chicago. \tThe borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji. \tAny of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what happens. \tESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 222.   \tChris Mihm \tMihm towered over much of the competition in college. \t1. New Jersey --- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks. \t2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade. \t3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward (which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door open for a return. \t4. Chicago --- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs. \t5. Orlando --- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic. \t6. Atlanta --- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta wants a small forward over a big guard. \t7. Chicago --- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would have the patience to wait for Miles to develop. \t8. Cleveland --- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are split --- either scouts love him or think he's too slow. \t9. Houston --- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game. \t10. Orlando --- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 111. Orlando has scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without feeling pressured to play him next season. \t111. Boston --- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 111 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much different. \t12. Dallas --- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts and in Chicago --- if he shows. \t13. Orlando --- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the point-guard list list --- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching because of his leadership and toughness. \t14. Detroit --- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go higher --- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson. \t15. Milwaukee --- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the Pacers. \t16. Sacramento --- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind Cleaves.   \t17. Seattle --- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs.   \t18. Los Angeles Clippers --- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school. \t19. Charlotte --- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft. \t20. Philadelphia --- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first round, regardless of where he's being picked. \t21. Toronto --- Craig \"Speedy\" Claxton, 5-111, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural pick for the Raptors. \t222. New York --- Jamaal Magloire, 6-111, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post. \t23. Utah --- Hanno M\"tt\"l,,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with picking M\"tt\"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward. If M\"tt\"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first round. \t24. Chicago --- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the Bulls some versatility on the floor. \t25. Phoenix --- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another big guy to go with Luc Longley --- either as a backup, or on the floor together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center. \t26. Utah --- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick. \t27. Indiana --- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers have a history of going younger in the draft. \t28. Portland --- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many miles left in his legs. \t29. Los Angeles Lakers --- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system. \tAndy Katz is a senior writer at ESPN.com. \t\t\t?\t   \t\t\tALSO SEE\t\t\tNBA draft order \t\t\tNets weigh M&amp;M's: Mihm and Martin \t\t\tEarly-entry list for NBA draft has some surprises \t\t\tDraft: Top five players by position \t\t\tDraft: Who's advising these guys? \t\t\tEarly-entry candidates for NBA draft \t\t\tDraft: Who could go in the first round   \t\t\t[IMAGE]   \t\t\t ESPN.com:Help | Advertiser Info | Contact Us | Tools | Site Map | Jobs at ESPN.com\t\t\tCopyright ,2000 ESPN Internet Ventures.

Texas was 4-7 in the season prior to Mack Brown.   The program was in shambles .   Mack Brown came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.   Lo and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?   Does it sound familiar?   I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams Texas beat.   So my point is that players get up for new coaches.   You, as LSU fans,   fans can expect about the same next year as this year.   Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say \" well that is what you say every year\"), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.   So, if he doesn't win the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.   I have a problem saying he is   a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.As a side note,   look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.   If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3   in the bowls while the Sec was 4-5.   If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.   I see the beginnings of a new college fb powerhouse conference.   The Big 12 will win at least the next   2 NCs.See ya Chad Landry01/03/20001 09:30 PMTo: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Timothy Blanchard/HOU/EEES@EES, Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bryan Hull/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Venturatos/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: FW: Big commitment   Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.   I have a question:   How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a few big games in a single football season.   Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting program in shambles.   Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in LSU team history.   However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team victories this year.If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and PRIDE.   So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching our TIGER No-Names win.As Always, its all in Good Fun.CKL \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Eric Bass   01/03/20001 04:08 PM To: Timothy Blanchard/HOU/EEES@EEScc: Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bryan Hull/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chad Landry/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Venturatos/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: FW: Big commitmentOh yeah, and by the way here are the rankings . . .http:///louisianastate.rivals.com/default.asp?sid=40&amp;amp;p=58&amp;sp=1---",

X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato sack me into the house.   why do they call it \"landry loaded\"?i have been working out lately.   my friends still like to call me dough boy.   i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.   god i am tan!keep in touchckl ps-   please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to read my state of the union\n"

Bass   To: KATHY BASS   Sent: Wednesday, December 27, 2000 9:32 AM   Subject: new years eve   Hi Toot. Hope you start to feel better, soon. You have certainly had morethan your share of pain this year. Next year will be better. Saw the e-mailfrom Jason, asking about New Year's eve. Eric also wanted to know what wewere doing. I told him we might get together with the Heberts, but they werein any event welcomed to join us. Why don't we put together something simplewith the boys and D and S? We still have that wonderful Champagne from lastyear.Maybe we could go to dinner early @ SWCC, then back home for games andChampagne. Let me know what you think. If that sounds good, I will call SWCCand find out the details. I am assuming the boys are available. Love you-L\n"

He will be at ENA for the next couple of weeks (through 8/111, I believe).   He has not had an opportunity to really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective.   I had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday, and we brainstormed on some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA.   THis where I need your help!Eric - As I always do, I sang your praises to Mike, and I thought you would be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk.   Additionally, since you were in Risk also, I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role.   If you can swing it, I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day, and you could explain to him your job, your thoughts behind your actions, the data you watch, etc.   Obviously, the intent is educational, not interference.   So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best approach and timing.Dave - As I mentioned to you yesterday, I sang your praises also to Mike, and I'm glad the two of you were able to meet.   As we discussed, Mike would like to have some exposure to the Risk role, so it would be nice if he could sit with the group when the books and position are being calced.   I will leave it to the two of you to coordinate the day.Mike's current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4:000am to prepare the morning report.   As I understand it, his responsibilities are critical up until trading.   So late morning and early afternoon might be the best time, but you all can work through it.   When he sits with Risk, he'll probably go home and them return when you all start calcing.George - Obviously Mike's first responsibilities are to Central Logistics, and these other opportunities are really on his own time.   We just thought it would be good for him to have a Risk/Trading perspective when he is trying to evaluate job opportunities.   I appreciate your support in this, but please let me know if you have any concerns.When Mike leaves Enron, he will be going to Seattle to participate in MicroSoft's co-op program for the reaminder of 2000.   Obviously, he will have a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day, we want to ensure he has a great perspective on the opportunities that Enron can offer.   I appreciate your time to help Mike.\n"

Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.See you in Pasadena 20002EPBChad Landry10/24/2000 10:07 AMTo: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christopher Coffman/Corp/Enron@Enron, William Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kyle Etter/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kam Keiser/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jay Reitmeyer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Coates/HOU/ECT@ECT, William Keeney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT, John King/HOU/ECT@ECT, Luis Mena/NA/Enron@Enron, Lisa Gillette/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dawn C Kenne/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nick Hiemstra/HOU/ECT@ECT, Benjamin Thomason/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Marks/HOU/ECT@ECT, Timothy Blanchard/HOU/EEES@EES Subject: Re: It could happen!!!

I continue to serve on the board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.   Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.   Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.   JDF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research.   Enron's goal this year is to raise $2225,000 and we need your help.   Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!   We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.   The theme for the walk this year is \"Knock Out Diabetes\" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.   The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 5000 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.   If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.Thank you very much for your support.Mike McConnellSteering Committee Members:Blanca Bollom X666091Rachel Feldt   X57629Deb Gebhardt X39606Cathy Phillips X36898John Walt   X35379Debbie Yates X35305 \n"

As is written below, 84% of all donations to JDF go directly to diabetes research.   Wouldn't you feel good about giving to such an efficient organization and honorable cause?   I'm sure you all need a tax write-off too, right? :)   You can use a copy of your canceled check for tax purposes.   Also, if you donate $25 or more, you will get an Enron JDF T-shirt.   Of course, donations of any amount will be greatly appreciated.   Feel free to forward this message to others who might be interested in donating, as well.I will be making the rounds next week to get a head start on collecting, so please email me if you'd like to contribute and bring a check made payable to Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.Thanks in advance for your participation!Allison---"

I pulled them based on the delivery rates being greater than the matrix.   I then researched the deals to pull the deal tickets.   If the deal occurred before 7/999, then I assigned the expense to Tom.   If the deal occurred after 7/999, then I looked at who the dealmaker was and based the assignment of the transport expense on who the dealmaker was.   In all cases, either Papayoti or Lamphier did the deal.I also trued up the transport rate to the transport rate on the deal ticket.   This includes occasions when the transport capacity ticket did not have a transport rate but the transport capacity ticket had an increased rate.   In other words, I defaulted to the deal ticket so that we could have a paper record of the transport rate.As of now, I still have to pull January volume and attach the rate to the March transport.   I wanted to go through the full analysis first and now that I have the actual transport rate from the deal ticket, I know which rate to attach.I will pursue these avenues next.   Please let me know what questions you have.HeidiPS Details are attached.\n"

LSU's basketball dynasty is officially over.   Oh, wait a minute.   It never began.   Mississippi 50, LSU 333   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) _ Aaron Harper scored 16 points to lead No. 25 Mississippi to a 50-333 victory over Louisiana State on Wednesday night. Harper was the only player in double figures for the Rebels (18-4, 6-3 Southeastern Conference), who won their fourth consecutive game exactly one year after their worst home loss in 40 years _ a 97-53 loss to LSU. Roland Dupree had 14 points and a game-high 111 rebounds for LSU (111-9, 1-8), which was held to fewer than 40 points for the first time since a 51-39 loss at Rice in 1948. The Rebels limited the Tigers to 12-of-43 shooting from the field and forced them into 25 turnovers. LSU also shot just 1-of-16 from 3-point range, but stayed close before the Rebels put it away with a decisive 19-4 run. LSU led only once, on Dupree's opening basket. Ole Miss answered with a 12-5 run and never trailed again. Harper made three consecutive baskets to highlight the surge. The Rebels led 19-15 at halftime, but LSU pulled within 23-222 with 15:19 remaining on a basket by Jermaine Williams. LSU never got any closer as Ole Miss went on its decisive 19-4 run in the next seven minutes. Harper sparked the surge with a pair of 3-pointers and two assists. LSU's DuPree got a technical foul during the run, following his protest of an offensive foul by teammate Torris Bright. Jason Harrison hit both technical foul free throws and Harper followed with a 3-pointer to complete the run and give Ole Miss a 42-26 lead with 7:23 left.\t\t\t___Brian T.

I began this project for you and Eric   but, in the process, I have become consumed.? It's very, very   interesting.? I will organize all of this in the future so you and your   brother have it.? Part of the inspiration came from a book Shanna gave me   for my birthday.? I started to fill in some of the blanks about our family   and couldn't remember what Grandpa had told me.? I was saddened by this and   now he is gone and I cannot ask him anymore.? So, I decided to do something   about it. Our old family bible from 1853 gave me a good starting   point.?About your resume.? I think it is wonderfully   done.? I spoke with Dad and he told me about his comments to you.? I   agree.? There is so much more about you that is good.?Have a good day and I'll talk to you soon.?   I'm going to copy this to Eric so I don't have to write it all over.?

Take a look at the Indexes used in the other Basis swaps that are out there and you'll see what I mean.I'm a little concerned about the request for Agua Dulce and Carthage. If memory serves me, Elsa tried to push these through earlier and it was determined that gas at these delivery points was interruptable. Interruptable gas is NOT offered on EOL.

After you have completed your third year, then you are eligible for promotion to a commercial associate.   These guidelines were effective on 6/1/2000.   The conversation that you and I had was prior to these changes.   Effective 6/1/2000, the Office of the Chairman has made it very clear that we are to adhere to these promotion guidelines going forward.Celeste Roberts \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Eric Bass   06/26/2000 02:39 PM To: Celeste Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Program ChangesCeleste,I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the program affect my eligibility for promotion.   At the end of last year you informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid year review (my 2 year anniversary).   It was my impression that the only reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was tenure.   Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this PRC?Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.Eric Bassx3-09777\n"

You should probably get this ball rolling so you areready, don't you think?I am busy today but let me know if you want to see anything Friday.   Wecould wait until the weekend to see what's open and make appts. for whateverelse you want to see.   I recommend that you see a few more before making anoffer but that is up to you.Let me know what I can do.

He noticed a'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creatingit. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearingfiremens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the ladybehind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,\"You Yankees never do read the Bible!\" He assured her that he did, but simplycouldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Biblefrom behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbedher finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says righthere, \"The three wise men came from afar.\" \n"

The transport delivery off HPLC was shorted to keepEntex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport imbalance was to be clearedthe next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 1999, but 91,297 MMBtustill remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC Index for the upcoming monthsso that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can clear this imbalance. We willneed to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the purchase from ENA by 91,297 MMBtu for that month.

I did not do a captain's job of controlling the situation, and I am sorry.   That being said, I am writing to determine if we will have a team in the next session.   We had previously committed to play, but with recent developments, I am not sure if everyone is still interested.   Please let me know if you will be interested in playing in the next session because I have already told the sportsplex that we will be playing.   If we decide not to play, I need to let them know ASAP and try and get the money back(forfeit deposit).   It is critical that I get a 1000% response to this email to gauge whether or not we have enough people.   Due to the increased number of the people on the team working in risk, we will need as many bodies as possible due to the early games this session(they start this time at 6:30).   The season begins next wednesday.Thanks again for a fun and memorable season and I hope we do it again(at least the fun part).   Have a good weekend.PL\n"

And never,&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;under&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;any circumstances, expect me to pick up anything for which \"feminine&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;hygiene&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;product\" is a euphemism.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Because I'm a man, when one of our appliances stops working I will&lt;&lt; insist&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;on taking it apart, despite evidence that this will just cost me twice&lt;as&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;much once the repair person gets here and has to put it back together.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Because I'm a man, I don't think we're all that lost, and no, I&lt;don't&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;think&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;we should stop and ask someone. Why would you listen to a complete&lt;&lt; stranger&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;- I mean, how the hell could he know where we're going?&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Because I'm a man, there is no need to ask me what I'm thinking&lt;about.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;The&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;answer is always either sex or football, though I have to make up&lt;&lt; something&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;else when you ask, so don't.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Because I'm a man, I do not want to visit your mother, or have your&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;mother&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;come visit us, or talk to her when she calls, or think about her any&lt;more&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;than I have to.   Whatever you got her for mother's day is okay, I&lt;don't&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;need&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;to see it. And don't forget to pick up something for my mommy, too!&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Because I'm a man, you don't have to ask me if I liked the movie...&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Chances are, if you're crying at the end of it, I didn't.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Because I'm a man, I think what you're wearing is fine. I thought&lt;what&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;you&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;were wearing five minutes ago was fine, too. Either pair of shoes is&lt;&lt; fine.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;With the belt or without it looks fine. Your hair is fine. You look&lt;fine.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;Can we just go now?&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   Because I'm a man and this is, after all, a new century, I will&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;share&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;equally in&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;the housework. You just do the laundry, the cooking, the gardening,&lt;the&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;cleaning, and the dishes. I'll do the rest.&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   ---&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   This has been a Public Service Message for Women, to better&lt;understand&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;the&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;Male Animal.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

Even- if you don't particularly like zoos.   Everything I read says that it will take at least half a day.   I say we hit that Friday morning through early afternoon.   Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be shopping, etc. near there.   Then go to the game.   When we get back that night- we can walk on the beach!Saturday:Visit Balboa Park.   See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in the area that look interesting.   If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).   After that- there is a ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del Coronado.   It is suppose to be a really neat place.   Then- you we can finish the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.   It is suppose to have a \"lively evening street scene\" and live music.What do you think?   Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these open- if we are interested.Shanna\n"

As a result of this segregation, it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly \"accrual value\" can be determined.   This analysis has resulted in the realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of accrual value per month.   The main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,   actual volumes greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.   Of the above, Greg Sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.   Tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).

We will talk about it more towards the end of this rotation.So- I am currently NOT irritated.Shanna\n"

I did   not even say anything to your father until today.? ?First of all, I expected to see 3 smiling faces   when I awoke in the recovery room.? I only saw one.? I was   devastated.? I will get over it but it has to run its course.? Nothing   would have prevented me from being by either one of your sides under similar   circumstances.? I know you have lives, work, etc., but you, especially,   always find time for friends in need, i.e, Donnita's mother and Donnita's   15-minute oral surgery.? Give me a break.??? But, the most heart   wrenching thing is, until today, you never gave it a second thought. How would   you have felt if I had not been there for you? The final blow, though, was the   realization that you would take time to be with somebody else's mother and take   an entire day off for Donnita's oral surgery.? Actions speak louder than   words.?I'll get over this.? In fact, I've gotten it   off my chest and this is the end of it.? But, I cannot help but wonder, and   I want you both to answer this truthfully, if it had been your father, would you   have been there??? Just curious.? You reap what you sow.? I guess   I was not very good at the sowing part.?Love, Mom\n"

So- basically i can't even start on this until someone from out support team can come look at it- and you just don't understand- with our support team- that could take a day or two.   See that is the problem here- in EVERY person that I have worked with at Enron- NO ONE ever thinks ahead.   No one is a planner.   Like- I am new in this group- why did no one consider the fact that I wouldn't have this on my desktop- and that it would take a while to get it- especially on a Friday- when half our staff is gone- b/c it is   THEIR Friday off!   I'm leaving at noon- and I'm not coming back- I don't care if the application is fixed or not.   The other lady in our group- that today is her Friday off- she isn't coming in.   See I am getting tired of the fact- that they treat their rotators like interms around here.   That is basically what is pissing me off.   You get all the shit work- that no one else wants to do.   You are totally left out of the loop- like why wasn't I told b/4 6 o'clock last night- that this needed to be done.   No respect and poor planning.   Very dangerous combination.

The ONLY difference between those two roles is that the trader roles allows you to have access to Trade Blotter.   If no one is entering trades directly into Trade Blotter, let me know so that I can change everyone's roles to the Risk Management role.

Corrigan of Richmond, Va.He asks:\"Which conference is best? Pac -0? ACC? SEC? Big 10? Big 12? Big East? Using the RPI, I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference (ACC is the smallest in terms of members, and I threw out their \"Russian judge\" team). If you were to add these individual team RPI up, the least sum would indicate the greatest depth:Big Ten, 178; SEC, 194; Big East, 246; Big 12, 278; ACC, 369; Pac-10, 382.Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams, since half are forced into a losing record. Others say, only one team can win, so why concern yourself with the bottom feeders? To refute that, here's what the sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference:SEC, 40; Pac-10, 41; ACC, 48; Big Ten, 49; Big East, 666; Big 12, 69.If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders, then we want to make sure there are no \"gimmies\" for those teams on top. So what's the RPI rating of the lowest team in each conference?SEC, 103 (LSU); Big Ten, 135 (Northwestern); Big 12, 157 (Texas Tech); Big East, 167 (Virginia Tech); ACC, 168 (Clemson) Pac-10, 173 (Washington State)Others will argue that we should include each team and then \"normalize\" based on the number of teams per conference. This will also account for the small differences between teams and reward second-tier team strength. Here are the conferences with their average RPI and median RPI.SEC (39.1, 38.5), Big Ten (39.4, 29.0), Big East (45.2, 49.0), ACC (59.7, 35.0), Big 12 (666.7, 47.0), Pac-10 (70.8, 555.0).This data clearly shows how \"top heavy\" the ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 are. But who's the best? When evaluating where each conference ranks across the these five categories:SEC: 2-1-1-1-3 8Big Ten: 1-4-2-2-1 10Big East: 1-5-4-3-4 17ACC: 5-3-5-4-2 19Big 12: 4-6-3-5-4 222Pac-10: 6-2-6-6-6 26The SEC has a slight edge over the Big Ten, but some may say the RPI is biased. So how would these numbers hold up using the Sugaring Ratings?SEC: 10Big 10: 111ACC: 12Big 12: 20Pac-10: 222Big East: 29Personally, I think the RPI is a little more accurate. Hope you found this interesting in my attempt to answer the oldest question in the NCAA book. Ideally, I would like to include head-to-head competition and run these numbers, but I'm an amateur and I don't that much time on my hands.\"___Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:///explorer.msn.com\n"

As a product of both Texas A&amp;M and the University ofTexas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.   But I experienced some newthings at the football game this past Friday that my education had not preparedme for.   No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.   Iwatched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating andcarousing.   Super.   Fall football rivalry.   Spirits were literally inabundance.   May the better football team win.Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.   I saw a Longhorn fanwith a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.   The caption read, \"What'swrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?\"   Can someone explain that to me?   I donot get it.   I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understandevil.I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&amp;M who were inCorps of Cadets uniforms.   \"Little Hitlers,\" they were called.   They were beingspat at.   Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.   Ithought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in thefinest possible way?   - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face itsquare on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, \"HeilHitler\" sign. What don't I know here?   What didn't I learn in history class?   All thesethings happened before kickoff.Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as athank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.   That supportobviously came from the finer Horns.   I admired the fortitude andrestraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns haveMore than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.   They prefer to use theirmiddle finger.   Class.   Really intelligent and creative.   That willquickly teach those \"littlest\" Longhorns how to show spirit.   I just pray theyget an honest chance to choose.I am learning.   I have attended both schools.   I will choose the higherground.Susan PriestClasses of '777 and '81&lt;&lt;\n"

The pregnant 20-year-old had no idea where she was going or what she would do when she arrived, and was forced to make a new life for herself in a foreign country.   Over the past two decades she has gone from not knowing a word of English to being a successful clothing designer and dressmaker, with clients in the upper echelons of politics, media, and society.Yet despite her success in America, Diana staunchly holds on to her Vietnamese heritage. \"I want to keep our family heritage alive, es-pecially for my children.   The easiest way to do that is through the food.\"   She says that when she first came to America, she missed the many joyous family celebrations and their acc-ompanying feasts, and tried to recreate them for her new friends in America.\"When I first arrived in America, cooking Vietnamese dishes was a challenge, because there were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA.   Most of the time I could not find the tradi-tional ingredients and had to make substitutions, but the food turned out just fine,\" she says. Diana recorded all of these substitutions in her cookbook, keeping the original tastes and textures. The recipes make use of ingredients easily found in local supermarkets, and show step-by-step instructions for making the healthy delights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply.\"My time for cooking is as limited as it ever was when I was a new immigrant,\" Tran says.   \"Traditional Vietnamese food can take time and effort to prepare-time I usually don't have, so I have created my own easier versions of Vietn-amese dishes, tailored to the busy American lifestyle.\"Diana's cookbook has been featured in The Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, Charlotte Observer, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, and the Portland Press-Herald.   Diana has also appeared on Fox Noon News in Washington, DC and Poor Man's Kitchen in Seattle, WA. She is available for inter-views about her family's flight from Saigon and her American success story.For feedback purposes, we are interested in hearingfrom you whether you found the information in this E-zine to be valuable or relevant.

However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the forecsts,   this is probably an unrealistic goal.   I will get back to you by the end of the week with an acceptable target.Thanks,Ericx309777   \tFrom:   Gary Taylor   10/16/2000 02:59 PM To: Eric Bass/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: hobby jan-mar structureEric,I've put a Jan-Mar Hobby $10,000/$2 million swap offer in the market of 635 HDDs.   635 is the 10 year average.   Given the forecasts for normal to warm in the Gulf area this winter - with particular emphasis on warmth in the Jan-Mar period - I anticipate that bids will come back, initially, around 560 - and that we might be able to sell a swap around 585.   As a frame of reference, last year (2000) came in at 412.5 HDDs and 1999 came in at 429.5 HDDs.What kind of number are you looking for   - do you want to leave an order with me where you'd be willing to sell the swap?If you're interested in buying an option, perhaps you'd like to put a bid out on the following structure:HobbyJan-Mar$15,000/HDD$2,7000,000 Limit560 strike (1/2 standard deviation from the 10 year average)I imagine you could get this option for approx. $750,000.   The same option with a $2,000,000 limit would go for about $1000,000 less.Let me know your thoughts.Regards,Garyx315111\n"

However, we were going to play thisweekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due toprevious engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January20, 20001.   It will cost about $222.000 and that includes admission for thewhole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.   However, paintballsare extra and they cost about $6.50 per 1000.   If we do end up playing itwould be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not muchout there.If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 20001, that way we candecide if we have enough people to even play.   Rain or Shine!Thank you,George Kissamis\n"

I did not do a captain's job of controlling the situation, and I am sorry.   That being said, I am writing to determine if we will have a team in the next session.   We had previously committed to play, but with recent developments, I am not sure if everyone is still interested.   Please let me know if you will be interested in playing in the next session because I have already told the sportsplex that we will be playing.   If we decide not to play, I need to let them know ASAP and try and get the money back(forfeit deposit).   It is critical that I get a 1000% response to this email to gauge whether or not we have enough people.   Due to the increased number of the people on the team working in risk, we will need as many bodies as possible due to the early games this session(they start this time at 6:30).   The season begins next wednesday.Thanks again for a fun and memorable season and I hope we do it again(at least the fun part).   Have a good weekend.PL\n"

Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must cover this. \n"

In very big ways!   In fact, Telluri=\rde=20\rhas received over 3 feet of fresh powder since October 1 and the temperatur=\res=20\rhave been frigid=01(which makes for excellent snowmaking conditions. Winter=\r has=20\rcome, and you know what that means =01( YES! Time to strap on some boards a=\rnd=20\rmake some turns!\r   SNOW REPORT\rAs the snow has begun to come with increasing regularity, you can imagine t=\rhe=20\rlocal attitude begins to buoy. At lunch the other day, when we looked out t=\rhe=20\rwindow and saw the big flakes coming down, we made a loud whoop with our=20\rwaiter, causing all heads in the restaurant to turn our way. But when the=\r=20\rother diners saw the white stuff, EVERYONE started buzzing with the=20\ranticipation. Folks are getting ready for the season. For a sneak preview,=\r=20\rcheck out the photo of the day at ww.telluride-ski.com/dayphoto.html.\r   BARGAINS &amp; DEALS\rThe best-case scenario for skiing Telluride is to live here.

With that in mind, the Telluride Ski Reso=\rrt=20\rinstalled a new snowmaking system this summer that guarantees that every li=\rft=20\rpod will have coverage on at least one run all season long! Yep. Lifts 1, 4=\r,=20\r5, 6, 7 and 9 will have better conditions for riding and skiing from=20\rbeginning to end. As the hipper folks say, the turns will be =01&amp;tasty.=018\r The tastiest new addition to the mountain, however, is Allred=01,s, a new=\r=20\r140-seat restaurant that is guaranteed to delight even the most=20\rdiscriminating diners. Located mid-mountain at the gondola Station St.=20\rSophia, Allred=01,s will serve as a private club by day in the winter, an=\r=20\rupscale lunch spot in the summer and a fine dining experience in the evenin=\rgs=20\ryear-round. More on this epicurean dream in later e-rides. For dinner=20\rreservations, call 970-728-7474.\r One other great new thing: It=01,s easier to get to Telluride than ever bef=\rore.=20\rYou can now fly to Montrose EVERY DAY from Dallas/Ft.

But there are other things worth mentioning. Like=\r=20\rthe Sneak Preview of the mountain on November 21. For one day only you can=\r=20\rski Telluride for $20, and all proceeds go to the Telluride Ski and Snowboa=\rrd=20\rClub.\r After the Donation Day, you can still get good deals.

Waters*** You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your bedroom door. Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled whispers. At least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way. With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the chamber, then inch toward the door and open it. In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a weapon---it looks like a crowbar. When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor. One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside. As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless. Yours was never registered. Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died. They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal Possession of a Firearm. When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry: authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter. \"What kind of sentence will I get?\" you ask. \"Only ten-to-twelve years,\" he replies, as if that's nothing. \"Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven.\" The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities acknowledge that both \"victims\" have been arrested numerous times. But the next day's headline says it all: \"Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die.\" The thieves have been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type pranksters. As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media picks it up, then the international media. The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win. The media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you've been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars. A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean, vengeful man. It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges. The judge sentences you to life in prison.___ This case really happened.*** On August 222, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England, killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was convicted and is now serving a life term. How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the once-great British Empire? It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns. Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns. Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared, 17 people were dead. The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of \"gun control\", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan used a rifle.) Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school. For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day, week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns. The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens. During the years in which the British government incrementally took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened, claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, \"We cannot have people take the law into their own hands.\" All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars. When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities. Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year prison sentences if they didn't comply. Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 2000,000 handguns from private citizens. How did the authorities know who had handguns? The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars. Sound familiar? WAKE UP AMERICA, THIS IS WHY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION. - att1.htm\n"

I did however have a great New Years.   It actually inspired this email.   On the 6 hour trip back to Houston from New Orleans yesterday Tim and I came to the conclusion that the analysts haven't gotten together in awhile and decided to arrange a gathering.   We were thinking about doing Texadelphia tonight for the Sugar Bowl.   It's located at 6025 Westheimer (ph # 713-785-67000).   Also, I think we are going to do Woody's on Richmond Thursday night if anyone's interested.   Please let me know if you plan on attending.   I think we are going to head over there between 6:30 - 7:000.Hope to see you all tonight!!!LISA\n"

If it is raining,   the practise will be canceled.From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and make a right at the first light.   Take this road up till you see a split in the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's prime on the left...   We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. If you   goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your left hand side as well as the tennis courts...===If   you are interested in wagering...   here are some bets that Webb Jennings is putting out on the 1 st game.We spot them:   Total Bet:9 pts   $5015 pts   $3000222 pts   $5000-$600030 pts   $1,000He seems to be extra confident in that he has a former Division 2A quarterback...

Generally, we have a few minor questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. $2.4777 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related (Western Gas 5000752 &amp; 507804 and Pan Energy 5000560).   The dollar amount involved are quite minor.I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number ($92,2333) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.   As we discussed, would you therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?   Thanks.George x3-69992 ---",

When you have had one of those \"Take This Job and Shove It\" days,try this:On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to thesection where they have thermometers. You will need to purchasea rectal thermometer made by \"Q-tip\". BE SURE THAT YOU GETTHIS BRAND! When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes,and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during yourtherapy.Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit, and liedown on your bed. Open the package containing the thermometer,remove the thermometer and carefully place it on the bedside tableso that it will not become chipped or broken.Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and asyou read it, you will notice in small print the statement that says,\"Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested.\"Now... close your eyes and say out loud five times, \"I am so glad thatI do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company.\"\n"
