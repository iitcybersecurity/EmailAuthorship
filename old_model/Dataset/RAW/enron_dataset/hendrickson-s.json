We allgrilled out Sat with Lolo and family, he has his garten looking so??? fine(we all are shocked at what he has been capable of...he built a wooden deck,edged it in stone, filled the whole yard with dirt, planted a full yard ofshrubs, etc...THEN he layed a stone driveway and walk way...IT'SBEAUTIFUL!!!Then on Sun Christina, Mitch and us went to A?manns for lunch and startedhaving aperitiffs...they were so good and we were IN THE MOOD...so we hadmore, then Herr A?mann treated us all to our favorite schnapps!   We werefeeling good by the time we left to go to our building and have MARGARITA'SAND WINE!!! After sunning and drinking all day we feasted on a fleischdinner...that was all we had here to eat, so we grilled bauchfleisch, steaksand bratw?rst...WE ATE SOO MUCH, but we had DRANK SO MUCH THAT WE NEEDEDIT, good greasy stuff.   They left about 8pm and we went home to bed.   GREATDAY!

That is one DAMN BIG feline!Now this is a Big Cat!Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River. The kittens had appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around the old labs, abandoned since the late 50's. With the help of his tuna   sandwich, Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could   pick them up. A self described animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the local Humane Society. Later that evening his wife Louise and their two children came to a family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found.   Lost was a female and Found was a male. When nature finally took its course, a litter of kittens was born 6 years later. One of the litter was a big white female with unique black markings on her side and tail.Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family, and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere, Snowball stayed with the Degagne's.   In her 9 years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball.   Put simply, Snowball is no ordinary cat --- she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87 lbs.   She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing.   She always meowed for more food and would climb up on the counter to eat food which I forgot to cover.   Chicken is her favorite. \"Once I left a cooked chicken on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic, an hour later the chicken was gone,\" Louise said. We knew that snowball wasn't your average cat when the neighbor's German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter with her.   She just isn't afraid of any animals.   After we found a half eaten raccoon out by the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced in. We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard, we couldn't keep raccoons from Snowball.   \"At least it kept the food bills down,\" Rodger laughed. \"Like all female cats she is very territorial, but with us she is just a big ole kitten,\" he said. So what does a 87 pound cat eat? Snowball goes through about 3 lbs. of cat food a day, along with cooked chicken, supplemented with deer and moose that Rodger hunts in the fall.   She likes Pike a lot, so I don 't throw them back any more.   Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight.   So what do the Degagne's attribute Snowball's size to?   Rodger says \"Well,the vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat, she's just a real big cat. I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they shouldn't have.\" NOW go have a look at \"Snowball.\"   - BigCat.jpg &lt;Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)&lt;\n"

I did run both days and am starting back at the gym today so I can become superbuff.   I've lost 6 lbs during this whole thing at least.   Just 9 more lbs to my goal of 140.   I saw Rayfael Friday when he came over to bring me a birthday present (he didn't think I was home!)   Then I took him some stuff that was at my house yesterday and we hung out a little bit.   I'm still hoping there's a chance we can get back together, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.   He definitely needs some time to himself and to get over this bout of depression.   I just hope that if he does, then he wants to get back together then, but I'm not sure he does.   We'll see.   I'm not interested in seeing anyone else right away, so I guess I can afford to give it a little time.   Can you put a spell on him?   heheheOf course, if we do get back together, that's bad news for the puppies.   If it did come to that, though, I would take them to doggie daycare during the day and they could stay outside at night - that wouldn't be so bad and they wouldn't be lonely.   Anyway, that's a BIG IF that I really shouldn't be concentrating on...so there.How are things in Germany?   How was your trip to London?

I have made several calls to speak with the lady in charge of payables.   They tell me she is never in the office, and there is no one else that is handling her duties.   I was wondering if you can speak to the trader/your contact there, so I can get this issue resolved.Thanks,Shielahx34315 \n"

Rayfael feels bad too, but it's important he not be near death anytime we're together.   He feels like the bad guy.   And I feel like a bad father!!!   I can't bear to think of their cute little faces staring in the french doors wondering what they did wrong!I'm getting paid back for all the nasty things I said about Barbara Dillard and her dogs!!!   I want   you to move back and let Mr. Bean and Greta live with you and Angus!!!   Nextdoor!!!
