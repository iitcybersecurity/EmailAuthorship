In the last two weeks this bearing has been changed two other times due to high temp problems. The last time the bearing was changed Roy Smith identified a high spot in the saddle area. This would cause a heavier load on the bearing and would result in temp problems. Today (Monday 28th) we worked on cleaning up the high spot. We also identified that the bearing that was installed also had a bonding problem. The babbitt on the bearing was pealing off. We then installed a bearing and took a complete set of deflection readings. The readings on number 2/10 throws indicated that the #4 main bearing is not over loaded. How ever the readings on numbers 7/15 indicate that #14 main is loaded heavy and might explain why this bearing is running higher then normal. Tomorrow ( Tuesday 29th.) we plan on making some adjustments to the chocks to relieve some of the load.   On Tuesday and Wednesday the Kingman team will be changing a turbo and after cooler. Myself and Roy Smith and two Tehas crew members will be working on the main bearings. We should have the alignment and bearing problem resolved by the time the turbo work is complete. Ronnie... \n"

I had them pull moisture readings and theywere well below TW's   #7 of water.   They said it was more like drip.   This heavies are in the gas streamthat is falling out and collecting in the pipe.

We would just have to work with Darrell Schoolcraft on TW operations and NNG operations to make it happen. Their may be days that it just does not work   on one side or the other   but once the line is cleared out of liquids we should be able to find a day on a bi-weekly or monthly basis to make it happen. We will work with you any way we can. Also, I'm sure it probably has already been looked into but is there anything that   can be done as to the location the condensate is coming from or could something be done at P-2 to catch it before it goes up the Panhandle lateral.Gary Randy LeBeau06/12/20001 05:46 PMTo:\tGary Spraggins/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc:\tRich Jolly/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON Subject:\tPigging from P-2 to P-3Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 222000 barrels of condensate out of the line.   We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line.   Apparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line.   I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it:The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas.   This point feeds some domestic customers.   We don't want condensate getting into this point.There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us.   Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes.   At any given time, I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production.   If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable.   I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeks) to get it back up.The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel.   When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point.   This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure.   The gas from Energas is NOT measured.   They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter setting.   Apparently they agreed (verbally) to supply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run.   The plant uses about 3 mmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours.   I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel...$21,000!   Obviously we will negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage.   I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours.Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happens.I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region.We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...possibly once a month.What do you think we can do to work something out?Thanks for any help you can give us.&lt;Embedded StdOleLink&lt;\n"

Time frame to analyze the malfunction unloaders should include 3-8 hours travel for the Analyst and Division Mechanical Specialist.   Presently, outage was requested for Wednesday, June 6th, from 8am to 6pm.   Initially, that outage was to accommodate program changes to the Unit Control program.   This outage also needs to include unloader inspection, which means there will be substantial downtime of Unit 401during the day.   Do I need to provide other information because unloader inspection will be performed?We found out last Thursday which unloaders were not functioning correctly.   I have asked Steve SanMiguel to circulate a memo detailing which unloaders are not operating correctly.   This memo should be sent today.If outage arrangements, other than the filling made for June 6th, can be made earlier, please let me know as soon as possible.   I will be on the road headed back to Amarillo today.   My cell phone number is 806-8886-8105.
