For example, the website available to the public has a 19\" monitor (M9991) for an extra $140.Second, why is Dell charging Enron employees more for the same products it offers to the general public?   For example, the website available to the public allows an upgrade from the E7770 monitor to the P9991 monitor for $290.   The Enron website allows an upgrade from the E7770 monitor to the P9991 monitor for $4000.   Therefore, Enron employees are being charged an extra $1110 for the same upgrade.I look forward to your response.Andy3-6278\n"
