I have two&lt; brothers, one&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;who is currently serving a non-parole life&lt; sentence in&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Attica, for the rape &amp; murder of a teenage boy&lt; in&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;19994, the other currently being held in the&lt; Wellington&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Remand Center on charges of incest with his&lt; three children.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;I have recently become engaged to marry a&lt; former Thai&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;prostitute who lives in the Bronx and indeed is&lt; still&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;a part-time \"working girl\" in a brothel,&lt; however, her&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;time there is limited as she has recently been&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;infected with an STD.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;We intend to marry as soon as possible and are&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;currently looking into the possibility of&lt; opening our&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;own brothel, with my fiancee utilizing her&lt; knowledge&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;of the industry working as the manager. I am&lt; hoping&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;my two sisters would be interested in joining&lt; our&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;team. Although I would prefer them not to&lt; prostitute&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;themselves, at least it would get them off the&lt; streets&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;and, hopefully, the heroin.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;My problem is this: I love my fiancee and look&lt; forward&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;to bringing her into the family, and of course&lt; I want&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;to be totally honest with her.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Should I tell her about my cousin who graduated&lt; from&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;KU?&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Signed,&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Worried about my reputation&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;___Do You Yahoo!?Send instant messages &amp; get email alerts with Yahoo!

He would swerve his van as if to hit&lt; &lt;   &lt;   them, and then he would swerve back on the road just before hitting&lt; &lt;   &lt; them.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;   One day, as the van driver was driving along, he saw a priest. He&lt; &lt;   &lt;   thought he would do a good deed and pulled the van over. He askedthe&lt; &lt;   &lt;   priest, \"Where are you going, Father?\" \"I'm going to give Mass atSt.&lt; &lt;   &lt;   Joseph's   Church, about five miles down the road,\" replied thepriest.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;   \"No problem, Father!

Climb in!\" The priest&lt; &lt;   &lt; climbed&lt; &lt;   &lt;   into the passenger seat, and the van continued down the road.&lt; &lt;   &lt; Suddenly,&lt; &lt;   &lt;   the driver saw a Nebraska fan strutting down the road, and&lt; &lt;   &lt; instinctively,&lt; &lt;   &lt;   he swerved as if to hit him. But, as usual, just in time, he swerved&lt; &lt;   &lt; back&lt; &lt;   &lt;   to the road, narrowly missing the guy.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;   Even though he was certain he missed the guy, he still heard a loud&lt; &lt;   &lt;   \"THUD.\" Not understanding where the noise came from, he glanced in&lt; &lt;   &lt;   his mirrors, but he didn't see anything.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;   He then remembered the priest, and he turned to the priest and&lt; &lt;   &lt;   said, \"I'm sorry, Father. I almost hit that Nebraska fan.\" \"That's&lt; &lt;   &lt;   OK,\"   replied the priest. \"I got him with the door.\"\n"

My Father and Mother have recently been arrested for growing andselling marijuana and are currently dependent on my other two sisters, who areprostitutes in Jersey City. I have two brothers, one who is currently serving anon-parole life sentence in Attica, for the rape &amp; murder of a teenage boy in19994, the other currently being held in the Wellington Remand Center on chargesof incest with his three children.I have recently become engaged to marry a former Thai prostitute who lives inthe Bronx and indeed is still a part-time \"working girl\" in a brothel, however,her time there is limited as she has recently been infected with an STD.   Weintend to marry as soon as possible and are currently looking into thepossibility of opening our own brothel, with my fiancee utilizing her knowledgeof the industry working as the manager.   I am hoping my two sisters would beinterested in joining our team.   Although I would prefer them not to prostitutethemselves, at least it would get them off the streets and, hopefully, theheroin.I love my fiancee and look forward to bringing her into the family, and ofcourse I want to be totally honest with her.   This is my dilemma:   Should I tellher about my cousin who graduated from RICE University?Signed, Worried about my reputation\n"
