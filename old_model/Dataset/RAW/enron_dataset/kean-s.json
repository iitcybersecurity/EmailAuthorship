      "body": "\nThe letter looks good.   A couple of comments for your consideration:On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it.   Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense?   Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.   Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution).   The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to \"regulate\" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities.   Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.   What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.   The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.   The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).   These components of the power and gas business can be \"regulated\" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.   They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other \"retailers\" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.   Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service.   Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations.   Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative.   But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing)... .   I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of \"ignorance or mistake\" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of \"prosecutorial discretion\".   I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to \"ignorance or mistake\", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD.   If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.\n"

If you could be so kind\ras to share with us the thoughts of Ken Lay=01%s office with regards to tha=\rt\rpoint, or give me a contact there, I would very much appreciate.\r An alternative we discussed or as an addition the next day (Lunch), would b=\re\rthat a business-group would host an event, which could include a wider\raudience of business people of Houston.   After having spoken with the Germa=\rn\rConsulate in Houston and with the German American Chamber here, it\runfortunately appears as if they will not be capable for s.th. we achieve.\rEverybody recommended to work with the reputative Greater Houston\rPartnership, whose President was on vacation last week.

He is offering to get us access to Andrew Lundquist (I said staffer preciously, but we now know he is Chairman of the President's Energy Task force). He also thinks he can get us in to top levels of the Energy Department, and the White House (we think he is talking about Carl Rove - who was G.W.'s Campaign Manager and is now a senior White House Counsel).For this service, he wants $10,000 plus direct expenses. If unsuccessful in at least getting us into Lundquist, he will not charge anything. We think it's a worthwhile shot. Could Duke and/or Enron agree to split the expense with us? Also, it will be imperative that all of us, whether paying or not, be represented at whatever meetings are arranged.Please advise.Regards,Steve Crain\n"

My feeling is that we should review its composition after the election --- we may lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look at who is contributing and who isn't etc.My agenda would be:1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss in 20001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time? 3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 20001, given whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we like to attract?I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you thinking.Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more convenient.\n"

The Minister signed a regulation under the Electric Utilities Act that excludes imports from influencing the determination of the pool price.   The Power Pool has been tasked to work out the mechanics of implementing the regulation.   Larry Charach advised that this move was made by the politicians in the face of advice not to do it from Larry.   Apparently the Premier met with representatives of Alberta farmers yesterday and also learned of what the Government considers to be excessive pricing being offered by   Enmax (the City of Calgary owned retailer) that included: 1 Year (on-peak) $190/Mwh Cdn, 1 Year (all-hours) $137/Mwh Cdn.   Peter Keohane and I have a meeting tomorrow morning with lawyers from Blakes.   The present thinking is that we need to get legal advice on whether we need to   send a letter to the Government indicating that Enron believes this action to be contrary to the provisions of the EUA prior to our participating in the MAP Auction on Monday and Tuesday.   The fear is that our conduct of pursuing new commercial opportunities in this market may somehow estop us from later arguing the new regulation is ultra vires the EUA.   Notwithstanding the advice we get on this point, there is agreement here (Milnthorp and Keohane) that if we do send a letter it must not include a paragraph threatening to sue the Alberta Government.

Please let me know if you have any additions, changes, or deletions.   What I tried to put down were the key facts and positions.   If I've missed anything let me know.   This is not a great story.JimOUR PHYSICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIAEES has electricity customers within the territories of SCE, PG&amp;E, and SDG&amp;E (about 8000 MW of usage) [NOTE - CHECK WITH EES].   EES has natural gas customers within the territories PG&amp;E and SoCal Gas.Enron does not have any generation in California (we own a small QF in Nevada but only have 50 MW excess).   We supply power to the Utilities and to our retail load by buying excess in California or by transmitting power into the state.   Enron sells natural gas to the LDCs mainly under spot arrangements.Enron continues to manage the risk by using traditional hedging tools and by using the full complement of resources of EES - demand reduction, load shaping, and efficiency improvements.Transwestern has long-term capacity arrangements with PG&amp;E.OUR POLITICAL POSITION IN CALIFORNIA / MESSAGESThe current situation (shortages and potential bankruptcy) is not the result of competitive markets, rather it is the result of barriers to workable retail and wholesale markets designed into the California deregulation model (for instance, the overreliance of the Utilities on the spot market, the residual CTC calculation, incomplete retail tariff unbundling requiring direct access customers to pay more than their fair share for the Utilities' common costs). Enron does not want to see the California Utilities go bankrupt because those naysayers of competition will use this situation as an argument against competition.   Enron disagrees.   What it proves is that not finishing the job of creating real competition can result in problems.   Enron believes that there are workable short-term and long-term solutions for California.In the short-term, (1) California must provide credit enhancement or directly buy power for the Utilities' needs to ensure a stable supply of electricity, (2) California should incent customers to institute demand reductions, and (3) California should raise rates to cover reasonable costs so that the Utilities do not petition for bankruptcy.In the long-term, (1) California needs to continue its activities to promote retail competition (and most importantly it must allow real price signals to be sent to large customers), (2) California should implement the changes that the FERC highlighted (end the reliance on the spot market, remove stakeholders on the Cal ISO Board, give the Utilties the ability to recover wholesale power costs), (3) California must remove unnecessary barriers to the development of additional generation capacity, and, most importantly, (4) California must establish reasonable structures so that the Utilities develop a balanced portfolio of supplies to better manage electricity market volatility.California should not get into the business of owning or operating generation assets or transmission facilities.   California should not stop moving forward with retail competitition which allows customers to manage price risk rather than some regulator.KEY ENRON ISSUES IN CALIFORNIAWe do have outstanding deliveries into the California utilities and would be an unsecured creditor if bankruptcy occurs. We continue to sell to creditworthy counterparties in Western Power markets. [NOTE - THE AMOUNT OF RISK IS AN IR ISSUE THEY WANT TO MANAGE].The PX Credit (and associated negative CTC) continues to be an issue.   Enron believes that the rate freeze has not yet ended legally and PG&amp;E's and SCE's tariff requires the Utilities to pay funds to the customer's agent.   We filed a Complaint Friday January 19 at the CPUC.   We are confident that these funds will be recovered.   [NOTE - I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS - AGAIN AN IR ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE RECEIVABLE]\n"

We now have marketing prototypes made, patents in place, outstanding consumer interest and are ready to proceed to the next step. The Angle Master can be very large or   small... The output gear smoothly transitions from 0-90 degrees at high torque to to reach or drill any angle. The input gear can be driven by any device. No product on the market can perform like the Angle Master. I can see the use of the Angle Master for various drilling applications, including horizontal drilling Professional mechanics in all fields who have seen the smaller Angle Master all want one. We have endorsements from professional drivers, mechanics, and many others. A recently retired Captain of a nuclear aircraft carrier has stated in a letter \"...The use of the Angle Master... will result in a significant time savings which in turn will increase combat readiness of aircraft and ships due to the more rapid turnaround of out of commission systems. Every mechanic will want the Angle Master in their toolbox after they have seen it in operation.\" A Senior Vice President of Operations for a major Aerospace Company has stated in writing \" ... Prototype manufacturing, tool manufacturing, assembly, repair and overhaul operations will all benefit from the flexibility of the Angle Master.\" The attached web page location underlined below is not yet completed, but it indicates just a few of thesmaller scale uses for the Angle Master. I look forward to hearing from you.   Sincerely,   Ed Szol President Angle Master Industries LTD. http:///www.nwlink.com/~eszol/index.html\n"

(PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energy's (SRE) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. were ordered to submit documents by the end of November stating whether they can build and operate \"peaking\" plants by June 1.The utilities weren't immediately available to comment.On the other hand, the ISO - which is on the verge of signing contracts for 4440 peaking units with between 20 and 91 megawatts of electricity - says the commission's meddling could endanger any chance of additional resources coming on line in time.\"Any further interference on the state level could destroy the plan altogether,\" said an ISO source close to the issue. \"There is no guarantee the utilities will be able to pull this off by next summer. And if the whole project is scrapped, you can expect there will be blackouts.\"Interference by federal regulators has already cost the ISO two participants and nearly 6000 megawatts in its peaking program.Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Enron (ENE) initially agreed to build peaking plants for the ISO next summer, but withdrew their offers after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission proposed capping the clearing price for California's wholesale electricity market at $150 a megawatt-hour.The ISO, which operates one of the state's wholesale power markets and manages most of the high-voltage transmission grid, has already solicited and received bids from merchant generators for 1,8000 megawatts of new peaking power for next summer.Burned by the summer's power crisis and facing an 8,000-MW shortfall next summer, the ISO put out a request for bids in August. The ISO's board voted Oct. 30 to enter into the contracts, which it estimated would cost about $250 million a year for three years.The state's Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the performance of the ISO, and the Public Utilities Commission protested the decision on the grounds that the contracts were too expensive.The commission is also questioning whether there is even a need for peaking power next summer and, if there is, whether the ISO should handle the solicitation.\"The question also arises as to whether the ISO - which is empowered only to operate the state's transmission system and which does not represent the state or its consumers - is the appropriate organization to plan, solicit and pay for the construction of new power plants across the state,\" the commission wrote in its Nov. 2 order.Ind the end, the decision is up to state regulators. If utilities can come up with a cheaper alternative and if the regulators determine that additional generation is needed by next summer, then they will follow through with the utilities proposal.\n"

The liabilities associated with it are not worth it when you consider it can be done, probably less than you are paying now, by a local provider and receive the same results.   We would be more than happy to provide you with an approximate value for the aircraft and get you in touch with a broker to sell the TU206G.   If you plan on continuing this operation with the Mesa owned aircraft, I suggest you put the responsibility in the hands of an aviation contractor who will be ultimately responsible to Mesa, not only with the upkeep of the aircraft, services/reports desired on patrol, but also the contracting of flight crews.If you desire, we will locate a contractor in Arizona to review the operation.   I would expect the cost not to exceed $2,000-$3,000 at the most.   Please call if you have any other questions or if you desire any additional help.   ---",
        " Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron on 12/16/999 09:12 AM ---Keith Jones12/16/999 08:58 AMTo: Gary Fitch/HR/Corp/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: Black Mesa Pipeline CoCessna TU206G Pipeline Patrol AircraftGary,I spoke with a Mr. Sil Perla, pipeline patrol manager for Black Mesa Pipeline Co., Tele 520-7774-5076.   As follows:Aircraft:   19777 Cessna TU206G \"Turbo Stationaire\" Six place single engine high wing aircraftHours:   ACTT 3270 Engine Time since new 350 hrs   PropTime since overhaul 1725.0 hrs (O/H date unknown)Insp Program:   50/1000 hr inspections and Annual Inspections.   Approximately two 1000 hr inspections per year average.   Last Annual inspection   completed July 1999.1) No maintenance performed \"in-house\".   All maintenance performed at Arizona Aircraftsman Inc., Presscott, Arizona.   This facility is a Certified Repair Sation and a Cessna factory authorized service center.2) Maintenance is scheduled by the pilots.   Mr. Perla doesn't appear to get envolved in the scheduling of maintenance.   I spoke with Mr. John Aderholt at Arizona Aircraftsman, Inc. and he said that the pilots schedule and deliver the aircraft for maintenance.   I asked how AD's and SB's were tracked and he seemed to feel that they weren't.   The only time AD's/SB's were checked was when the aircraft was in the maintenance facility.   Mr. Perla said he was not familiar with Airworthiness Directives (AD's) and more or less confirmed this.   Mr. AderholtArizona Aircraftsman said the aircraft was in very good condition and that it was a low time aircraft.   He said they did very thorough inspections and that Black Mesa usually didn't have a problem with any needed repairs.3) The aircraft is used twice a month and flies a 546 mile trip at 3000 feet above ground level, VFR day only.   The aircraft averages 20 - 40 hours per   month.   Mr. Aderholt mentioned that the aircraft had flown 50 hours since the Annual inspection in July this year.   They occasionally will have a passenger but he said this is rare.   If someone wants to fly along the patrol the aircraft will stop and drop someone off at a plant, etc., but again this is rare.4) He uses \"rental pilots\" for the patrols.   Currently he only has two he uses.   One has over 2000 multi/single time and the other has over 23000 hours in a little of everything.   The main \"go-to\" pilot is a gentleman named Rick Olsen; he's the 2000 + hr guy.   Mr. Perla said they both qualify for insurance purposes.5) The pilots will review the maintenance logs for currency and accuracy and the repair invoices for discrepancies and action taken.   Mr. Perla didn't seem to get envolved in this.   I further confirmed this through Arizona Aircraftsman; that Mr. Perla definately does not get envolved in the maintenance of the aircraft.   He leaves it strictly to the pilots.   There are only two repetative AD's on the airplane, both due each 1000 hrs.Summary: Mr. Perla said he has been with Black Mesa for two or three years and that he was fairly new at this.   My impression is that he doesn't get envolved with the particulars of aviation and therefore doesn't really have much input as far as the actual operation and maintenance of the aircraft is concerned.   The aircraft itself is probably in very good condition and is a very reliable workhorse that can endure its fair share of rough usage.   Although the aircraft is a simple and durable single engine aircraft; and its operation is relatively easy.   I believe it would be prudent to conduct a thorough review of the aircraft and records.   And establish a stable base of operations that is familiar with the legalities, and safe operation of a single engine aircraft.   In my opinion it appears that no one is paying attention to the details!A few items in particular are:a) The prop overhaul date is unkown.   The factory recommends an overhaul each five years.b) No one is responsible for AD's and SB's.   Apparently they do not go to Mr. Perla, but to some other office.c) Other details like ELT battery dates, operation in accordance with FAR's etc. may not be monitered adequately.d) Mr. Perla mentioned that he is going to have some interior work and avionics upgrades next year.   Assuming his limited knowledge of aviation, what   assurances do we have of a legal and safe installation.\n"

Three key changes:They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the entire \"rate freeze\" structure remains intact for now).The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's \"netting out\" of gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to lower chances of a successful utility appeal).The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.   They will submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the utilties' power purchase costs.   This action has reportedly been the result of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs credit worthy and solvent.   As a result of those wires stories, the utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is currently at 10 7/8; PG&amp;E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 111 7/8).   We're working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in California, to get more info and will report back.The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.   Only FERC was demonized more.Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent \"interim\" appointee,   made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.The Commission left open the possibility of \"doing more\" at their next meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is reached, it could end up on the next agenda.\n"

(or even 6?), there is room under the 7? new commodity rate component to recover securitized costs (amounts to about 40% of SCE supply).Says good progress was made today.   Believes they may have a framework this evening.Believes 5.5? is causing problem; maybe room to squeeze it up (perhaps as high as 6.0?).Thinks governor will slightly increase rates (or pay more at government facilities) if the parties can get 97% of the way to a solution.Thinks it's nearly a \"done deal\" that DWR (state entity) will buy power.Says securitization may be harder to get.Bryson's questions to Ken (and Ken's to us):   Are we willing to forbear payment of amounts owed to us and continue to sell power to the utilities over the next several weeks.   Ken realizes that Bryson may be overstating the progress made, and made no commitments to Bryson.Let's discuss at 10:30 call tomorrow.\n"

Steve, I heard on a talk show that the Bush Energy Policy would tackle such topics as Alaskan Gas, ANWR and also would mention the Powder River coal bed methane play.   I would like to get a copy of the Energy Policy when it becomes available.   I would also like everyone to be aware of the large investments made and planned by Northern Border Partners in the Powder River and Wind River Basins of Wyoming.   In addition, the Denver office of Enron North America has a large stake in gas trading in the Rockies.   Everything considered, the development of Rocky Mountain gas reserves, including the gathering and pipeline infrastructure will be less controversial than ANWR and will get gas to markets much sooner.   For example, Northern Border Partners expects to file at the FERC by the 3rd quarter of 20001 for the Bison Pipeline project which will connect Powder River reserves to NBPL in 20003 (versus 20007 for Alaskan gas).   You can see the latest on the Bison project at Inside FERC, December 18th page 5.One pending federal action that would do much to enhance coal bed methane production, is the completion of an EIS   presently being prepared by the BLM.   The timely issuance of a favorable EIS would open thousands of federal acres in Wyoming and Montana to drilling by coal bed methane producers and would assist gas in getting to market within Bush's first term in office.   I hope Enron and the new administration can set Powder River gas as a priority item in the coming year !\n"

George W. Bush wants to compare   notes on issues ranging from Internet privacy, to cyber crime to closing the   so-called ```digital divide''' that sometimes leaves minority households behind in   the computer age during a planned Wednesday meeting with technology leaders.   About 130 members of the Bush campaign's 350-member high-tech council, including   Dell Computer Corp. chairman Michael Dell, were scheduled to meet behind closed   doors at Austin's Jewish Community Center.?. . ```I am excited   about all of the opportunities that technology has given us to make a profound   and positive impact on the world,''' said Bush, the presumptive Republican   presidential nominee. ```America is a pioneer in the high-tech industry and it is   vital for us to maintain this status,''' Bush said. ''' Leading the world in   innovation will not only improve the lives of Americans, but will also create   many quality jobs.''' The purpose of the meeting was to allow the group to   present Bush with their thoughts and share up-to-the minute information on the   issues, said Bush campaign spokesman Tucker Eskew. The campaign also was to   unveil its revamped Web site. One of its features will allow users to download   event-specific posters or placards for campaign events.   ??? - USATodayAd-Bush NSC.pdf\n"

This chart is not quite there.   However, it is a rough aggregate of the NOx generated by all of the existing fossil fuel generation over 50 MW in CA.   The data points were gathered from the EPA's Acid Rain CEMs (continuous emissions monitoring) database.   (I am working on a chart that's message is more clear.) As you will see, existing generation is significantly dirtier than what new, combined cycle plants would be.   In fact, of the utility units in CA reporting under Title IV, there are a number of steam plants with NOx emissions of 0.1 lb/MMMBtu or in some cases more.   This corresponds to about 1 lb NOx/MWh compared to 0.056 lb/MWh for a new gas combined cycle plant.   Even the cleaner boilers that are at 0.05 lb/MMMBtu are 10 times higher than the new plants on an output basis.   In otherwords, Dave Parquet is right that there is a lot of more polluting generation on line, while new plants have to meet ever tighter BACT requirements.In the most recent version of SB 28 it looks like there are a lot of provisions focusing on the retrofitting of existing generation.   I suspect, the regulators are well aware of the discrepancies in emissions and would argue that the plants are going to have to clean up in the very near future.   I am digging for more information on these timelines.Gus, Marc, and I felt like the main short term fixes/solutions would be:1.   Expanding the hours of operations for back-up generators.   (As I have previously stated, some of the local air districts have increased the permitted run hours for emergency generators from 2000 to 5000 at only \"essential public services.\")   2.   CA requiring offsetting of emissions at only the ratios required by Federal regulations.   In many cases state requirements are more stringent.3.   The EPA allowing the concept of the pollution mitigation bank - it is really going to be an issue of timing - once the CA government has the funds to start acquiring offsets they will be able to provide them prior to the operation of a new generation facility, However, there is going to be some initial lag time where the offsets aren't in the hands of the generation operators (which goes against the requirements of the Clean Air Act).4.   The Feds working with the state and local permitters to create alternate sources of emission offsets.   There simply aren't enough in all the air districts.   As I stated, in my previous memo the USEPA has allowed, under the NOx SIP call, emissions allowances to be given to renewable and energy efficiency projects. CA is going to need guidance from the USEPA in how to create and count alternate sources of offsets in nonattainment areas.5.   The USEPA better defining the nonattainment air sheds and pollution transportation pathways.   Apparently, there is not a central model of the air patterns in CA.   Thus, the 35 local air districts all having different requirements about inter-district offsets.However, the real issues as Dave alluded to in his memo are going to require modifications to the Clean Air Act.   It is pretty prescriptive about what can and can't be done, and there is not a whole lot of flexibility.   Let me know if anything in here is not clear.   I'm working on refining the data and presentation of the data.Mary SchoenEnvironmental StrategiesEnron Corp713-345-74222\n"

The CEC significantly underestimates the outages that may occur this summer.   They estimate in their 5,000 MW supply deficit for the summer that expected outages will be around 3,000MW.   However, November and December saw significantly higher outage levels.   (7,265 MWs) The FERC has investigated these outages and found no improprieties- just that the plants are overtaxed from running at higher than normal capacities.2.   There are a lot of uncertainties surrounding the 1,2444 MWs of projected supply from rerating/restarting existing thermal and renewable projects.   It is very unclear how much of this will be able to come on line by this summer, if at all.   As evidenced by the e-mail I sent out this morning, local communities may be very opposed to restarting shut down units.   In addition, these units are likely to be uneconomical.3.   In the existing resource pool, there are roughly 1,430 MWs of peaking or other generation units that are running up against their operating hour limitations from air quality regulations.   The Governor has ordered the local air quality districts to address these restrictions,   We are beginning to seem some movement; however, the US EPA has yet to weigh in on these relaxed standards.4.   The distributed generation/back-up generation capacity to make up some of the shortfall is still an unknown.   While there has been some relaxing of the limitations on run hours for back-up generation at \"essential public services\" the increase in DG is expected from \"clean\" sources, not diesel emergency generators.5.   The CEC is doing everything it can to get 50+ MW peaking units on-line by this summer.   They are promising a 21-day permit application approval process and are offering to pay half of the cost of offsets, for \"clean\" sources of generation in critical areas.Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.CEC's Summer Forecasted Peak Demand - Resource Balance: List of Peakers running into their operating hour limitations:Also available in hard copy format only:(please e-mail me your fax number if you'd like a copy)Table 1:   Fully Executed CA ISO Summer Reliability Agreements (the ISO Peaking Facilities)Table 2:   Summer 20001 Supply Options - Renewables Construction Status SummaryTable 3:   Summer 20001 Supply Options - Rerate of Non-CEC ProjectsTable 4:   Summer 20001 Supply Options - CEC Rerate Status SummaryTable 5:   Idle Biomass Plants Potentially Capable of RestartMary SchoenEnvironmental StrategiesEnron Corp713-345-74222\n"

Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).   As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it recessed.   The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions (Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).   The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July.   However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support.   More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.   What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation.Lee Sachs message was just that.   I told Lee that we shared his desire to move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all non-agriculture commodities (including metals).   He said that we would have a difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said   \"we would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language\" (which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.   However, I do not expect Treasury to be vocal in support of our position.   It is clear that Congressional leaders and the Administration want to get this bill done this year and there remains a good opportunity for enactment.However, with less than 20 or so legislative days left, we need Senator Gramm to engage.   A call from Ken Lay in the next two weeks to Senator Gramm could be an impetus for Gramm to move his staff to resolve the differences.   Gramm needs to fully understand how helpful the bill is to Enron.   Let me know your thoughts on this approach.   I am prepared to assist in coordinating the call and drafting the talking points for a Ken Lay/Sen. Gramm call. \n"

Lee said that senior-level negotiations led by Secretary Summers were initiated last week between the CFTC and SEC and that progress was being made on the single stock futures issue (the major issue postponing movement of the legislation).   As you know, the House completed committee work on HR 4541 before it recessed.   The bill will now is pending before the Rules Committee where differences will be worked out between the three different Committee versions (Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking).   The Senate Agriculture Committee passed out the Senate version in July.   However, the bill is not moving quickly in the Senate due to Senator Phil Gramm's desire to see significant changes made to the legislation (not directly related to our energy language). Last week at the Republican Convention, I asked the Senator about the bill and he said they were working on it, but much needs to be changed for his support.   More telling perhaps, were Wendy Gramm's comments that she would rather the current bill die if a better bill can be passed next year.   What this means is that we must, at the least, remove Senator Gramm's opposition to the bill to move the process and more importantly seek to gain his support of the legislation.Lee Sachs message was just that.   I told Lee that we shared his desire to move the legislation as long as it contains a full exclusion for all non-agriculture commodities (including metals).   He said that we would have a difficult time defending the metals provision politically. But, Lee said   \"we would not find Treasury opposition to the House Commerce Committee language\" (which includes favourable language on energy and metals).   This is a positive development, because it isolates the CFTC from its key defenders and I hope ensures no veto threat on our issues.

Although, the contract looks like it only allows us Intranet use and not Internet use as well.   This premise was confirmed by Margaret too, because she recalls paying $2,000.000 for a Intranet/Internet video link, and only $5000.000 for a Intranet link.   My unsolicited recommendation would be to purchase the external link as well as the internal link.   I believe we would get a lot of mileage out of posting this link on our website - with downloadable supporting software - to allow users to view the video.   From a PR perspective, I would refer 90% of incoming inquiries to our site, as well as sending them general company info.   Also, it would unequivocally illustrate and promote why Enron's has been voted 'Most Innovative Company' for five consecutive years in a row.Now...enough of my blabber and to the point...I am still waiting to hear back from CNN to assess exact pricing for both types of links.   I've placed two follow-up calls but have not yet heard anything.   If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to inquire with me.Regards,Cindy\n"

Officials from Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) have asked the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to grant immediate rate hikes of as much as 30 percent to help offset rising wholesale power prices. The CPUC board is expected to announce on Jan. 4 how much of a rate hike it will allow, and under what terms. Analysis: Despite the lull of the holiday week just now completed, the spotlight continues to grow more intense over California's energy market, both throughout the energy industry and across the mainstream media. As we wait with anticipation to hear what the CPUC will decide, let's recap some of the issues that will no doubt continue to cause great dissension among the primary players in California. As has been well documented, PGOand SCE are in a massive amount of debt due to uncollected costs they have accrued related to the purchase of power on the wholesale market. Due to rate freezes still in place, both utilities have been unable to charge customers for the dramatic increase in the price of wholesale power, which has placed them both on the brink of bankruptcy. From several conversations with my contacts in California, here's my understanding of where the negotiations currently stand. The CPUC already has agreed in theory to a rate increase, but the sticking point is the specific amount of that increase. Reportedly, the CPUC and Gov. Gray Davis proposed a 15-percent rate hike to the two utilities. In sharp contrast, PGOmaintains that it needs to increase rates by as much as 40 percent, and SCE says that it wants an increase of 30 percent (or 76 percent over two years). In fact, PGOalready began notifying customers last week that it wants to boost their electric bills by that specific amount. Both utilities continue to argue that even if their proposed rate increases are accepted, they still may not be enough to cover wholesale costs, which are projected to rise through 20003 (see my IssueAlert from Dec. 29). In addition, PGOand SCE also claim that their financial solvency still will not be guaranteed even if their rate increase proposals are accepted, and bankruptcy will be very likely if the CPUC only allows them to increase rates by 15 percent.   Over the last few weeks, pressure was put on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to step in and solve the problem. However, FERC issued its own order in early December that mainly focused on mechanisms to keep power generators active in the state and did not adequately address the core issues of high wholesale prices and rate freezes. Due to the lukewarm response that FERC's order received, it has been generally concluded that the CPUC and Gov. Davis alone will have to solve the California energy crisis.   It is important to not overlook or discount the role that consumer advocates are playing in the negotiations. Harvey Rosenfield, a long-time critic of the state's utilities who led the failed attempt to overturn deregulation in California in 19998, remains very vocal that \"the people of California should not have to pay one more penny to bail out the utilities for the mistakes they made.\" Consumer groups led by Rosenfield and Ralph Nader continue to put enormous pressure on Gov. Davis, a Democrat, to keep any rate increase given to the utilities to a minimum. In fact, last week Nader stated that Davis' political future \"hangs by a kilowatt hour\" and that any decisions made in California will \"reverberate all over the country.\" In essence, consumer groups believe that utilities share the bulk of responsibility for the current mess in the state, as they played a large role in California's 19996 restructuring legislation. If mistakes were made in that legislation, consumer groups say, the utilities and not utility customers should be made to pay the price.   Speculation is growing that, on Jan. 4, the CPUC will approve an increase for extra costs that will be applied in increments over the course of 20001, resulting in an ultimate rate increase that is somewhere in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent (or more). This in effect will offer a compromise to both sides. The utilities will receive a rate increase closer to what they claim is necessary, and utility customers will not get slapped with an immediate, all-at-once increase in their electricity bills. However, the CPUC probably will not approve any back billing that the utilities have also demanded. Both PGOand SCE have claimed that their stranded costs were probably paid off months ago, meaning that the rate freeze still in place for both utilities should have been lifted as a result. That theory being accurate, both companies want to bill their customers retroactively to the date that the rate freeze should have been lifted, which on its own could amount to several billions of dollars. Under the current arrangement, the rate freeze is scheduled to stay in effect until March 20002, unless lifted by the CPUC. Meanwhile, the question about the financial solvency of both PGOand SCE continues to loom. SCE's parent, Edison International, announced that it has eliminated its fourth-quarter dividend and reduced its work force by 4000 jobs because of financial problems related to SCE. In a statement last week, PGOCEO Gordon Smith acknowledged that PGOhas \"virtually exhausted its financial resources\" because it has borrowed on average $1 million per hour to pay for power that it is obligated to provide to California consumers.   Both utilities have argued that the real cause of the problem in the state is the generators who unjustifiably continue to charge exorbitant rates for power on the wholesale market. There may be some validity to this theory as power generators who operate in California know that the state's IOUs have essentially been stripped of their own ability to generate power and thus are heavily dependent on power bought on the wholesale market. This has given an enormous amount of market power to the generators and allowed them to charge rates that are not reflective of their own costs. Some reports indicate that generators are charging as much as 30 times what it costs them to generate power. Yet, without a cap on wholesale rates, generators remain able to charge whatever price the market will bear.   Due to these high costs, some power generators have begun refusing to sell power to the California IOUs, out of fear that the utilities will not be able to pay their bills. In an ironic twist, the same companies that have expressed concern about selling power to PGOand SCE actually own and control the plants that were divested by the two utilities as part of their agreements in the state's restructuring plan. Thus, companies outside of (and inside) California that own California plants are refusing to sell power back into the state, power produced at plants that were once owned by PGOand SCE. As a result, PGOwent on record last week saying that it may not have enough power to serve customers in February unless additional rulings come from the CPUC. PGOsays that it has enough power to supply customers through January, but that 15 to 20 suppliers have demanded payment up front before selling natural gas to the utility in February. Due to its current debt situation, PGOclaims that it cannot make any payments up front and thus may not be able to buy natural gas to serve its customers.   These issues have formed the landscape across which negotiations still rage on in California. Much pressure is now being placed on the CPUC to formulate an end-all solution to the state's problems, one that can appease all the dissenting stakeholders. Yet, much like FERC's order which was criticized for not going far enough, the CPUC is particularly challenged to make decisions that can once and for all solve the state's structural problems. As Enron's Kenneth Lay said a few months ago, the CPUC must avoid \"putting band-aids on California's hemorrhaging wounds\" and instead complete a successful reconstructive surgery.

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs   By Rebecca Smith   09/01/2000   The Wall Street Journal   Page A4   (Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)   California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with   high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power   plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power   rates to levels seen prior to deregulation .   Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per   kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. can be   charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that   commodity price.   The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the   average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been   deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a   state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared   with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier.   Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The   rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to   schools and hospitals.   In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California   Public Utilities Commission until December 20002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of   general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly   exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make   up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost.   Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., said the   rate-cap measure is \"deeply flawed\" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets   no floor. That means any shortfall could grow --- without a mechanism for customers to pay   it down --- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 20002 or   December 20003.   Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $6664 million, provided   future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through   December 20002. \"It's irreparably damaging to Sempra,\" he said because it \"creates   tremendous uncertainty\" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance   new projects such as a new transmission line.   The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the   construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that   review the plans.

The intranet site will be placed on the home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your California Power Issue needs. The database has been populated with the latest information that I have received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has then been broken down further into subcategories.The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have access to this information. The secured document section contains all the information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these documents should not be restricted.To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go to this link:   http:///nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf   (It is best if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape browser.)Once you are at this site you will   be able to access all articles and information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, go to this link   and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter your new network password.) There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-4382.Thanks,Gavin \n"

It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.   Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an \"informational\" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.   It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.   From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.   The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.   There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.   Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.   It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.   Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.   In short, a very bad bill.Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.   Many---including Enron---support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).What people don't know:Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.Best,JeffSacramento is one goofy place.\n"

All rights reserved. Copyright Cato Institute Spring 20001THE FINAL WORD CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 19888 and 19998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on \"negawatts\" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 19996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 20002. This is like requiring A&amp;P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the \"Information Economy\" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. \"Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,\" Davis declaimed. \"Take\" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. Californians want to snatch that money back. \"Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,\" reported the January 31 Washington Post. \"They took the money and ran,\" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too. R J. O'Rourke is the Cato Institute's H. L. Mencken Research Fellow and is foreign affairs desk chief for Rolling Stone.

You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&amp;E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:   PG&amp;E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.   There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just \"passthroughs\" for the suppliers ... and PG&amp;E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).\n"

The stock closed yesterday at $27 per share. The Company\rexpects to receive net proceeds from the offering of its shares at=20\rapproximately\r$473 million, exclusive of the underwriters' option to purchase an addition=\ral\r3,6000,000 common shares to cover over allotments. TNPC, Inc.=01*a partnersh=\rip\rbetween Enron, America Online (AOL) and IBM=01*was formed in late 1999 to\rprovide electricity and natural gas directly to households and small=20\rbusinesses\rin the deregulated energy marketplace. TNPC's shares will be listed on\rthe NYSE under the symbol NPW. Closing of the offering is expected to occur\rOct. 111.\r ANALYSIS: I am sure that many eyebrows were raised when TNPC issued the\rIPO of its stock at $21, a figure that seemed surprisingly high for a start=\r-up\rcompany that has been in operation only since early summer. It is rather\rmind-boggling that a company with no significant track record could open\rits stock at such a price, but it is not unheard of. In fact, TNPC is=20\rfollowing\ra trend of new Internet companies initiating IPOs that are supported by\rgrand concepts rather than tangible success. However, the TNPC \"dream team\"\ralliance between Enron, AOL and IBM has been met with great expectations\r(and a lot of skepticism as well) throughout the industry.\r I read through the S-1/A filing that TNPC submitted to the SEC, so hopefull=\ry\rI can cut through the hype regarding this deal to get to its nucleus. First=\r,\rTNPC acknowledges repeatedly throughout its filing that it is entering\rinto an extremely high-risk venture, and in fact will \"incur substantial\roperating and net losses, and cannot assure that we will attain=20\rprofitability.\"\rFurther, TNPC admits that it expects to incur these losses for a=20\r\"significant,\"\rbut undetermined, period of time. Why, then, would Wall Street be greeting\rthis IPO with such a positive welcome? One could easily argue that the\rsheer market presence of Enron, AOL and IBM has by association driven up\rthe value of TNPC, but I think a deeper answer lies within several factors.\r First, TNPC has been bankrolled by some hefty investments. In two separate,\rprivate placements, investors such as Enron, GE Capital Equity Investments\rand DLJMB Partners (among others) put up about $214 million in start-up\rcapital in exchange for shares in the company. Enron is the majority owner\rof TNPC, with 57-percent control. This money has allowed TNPC to make=20\rimportant\racquisitions. For instance, TNPC bought the residential and small commercia=\rl\rretail energy business of Columbia Energy Group, which includes approximate=\rly\r285,000 natural-gas customers and 20,000 electricity customers in eight\rstates. This is a valuable card in TNPC's deck as it locks in customers\rduring this time when deregulation is developing slowly in retail markets.\rI wouldn't be surprised if TNPC makes a similar acquisition of another\rcustomer base in the near future, such as in Texas, where customers have\rbeen spun off to energy service companies rather than being held by the\rT&amp;D operations of utilities. In other words, in Texas TNPC could easily\rbuy customers without having to buy wires or infrastructure, assuming there\ris a willing seller.\r Second, and perhaps more importantly, earlier this year Enron transferred\rits residential and small commercial retail operations in California and\rOhio to TNPC. This deal included the operations of Enron Energy Services\rbut did not include PG&amp;E Energy Services, which Enron acquired earlier\rthis year. Together with the Columbia Energy Group acquisition, TNPC has\rcome out of the gate running with a significant beginning customer base\rof over 325,000 customers. Why would Enron have turned over its residential\rcustomers to TNPC?   Don't forget that Enron struggled in and retreated\rfrom the California residential market, stating that it couldn't make any\rmoney in the retail market. TNPC's S1/A filing confirms rumors that Enron\rEnergy Services actually retreated from California due to a lawsuit claimin=\rg\rthe company had violated laws relating to advertising directed to residenti=\ral\rconsumers in 19997 and 19998. Enron was in fact banned from selling power\rto the residential market in California. Under this customer transfer,\rEnron is able to put its money into a completely separate business=01*essen=\rtially\rmoving this high-risk business venture, and worst performing part of its\rretail service, off its own books. Yet if TNPC succeeds, Enron still benefi=\rts\ras it is the majority owner.\r I think these two factors answer why Wall Street has looked so favorably\ron a self-described \"new company with a limited operating history.\" Looking\rahead, can TNPC maintain this comparatively high value of its stock?   Well,\rthere's both good news and bad news for TNPC. First, let's look on the\rbright side. TNPC has put into place a great management team, starting\rwith H. Eugene Lockhart, formerly of AT&amp;T, as president and CEO. Other\rkey players bring retail market expertise from work at MasterCard, Exxon\rand PespiCo. In addition, within the energy industry, TNPC arguably could\rnot have a better backer than Enron. What other company's touch has been\rgolden in nearly every venture it has pursued? In addition to being the\rmajority owner, Enron probably is also providing TNPC access to commodities\rat preferential prices, which will certainly enhance its sales approach\rin the retail market. Plus, TNPC has access to the 24 million customers\rthat AOL represents, which I've always thought was the company's secret\rweapon.\r But then there are the risks, and they are substantial. First, competition\ris not materializing rapidly on the retail side. In a state like Pennsylvan=\ria,\rwhich perhaps represents the strongest deregulated market in the United\rStates, only about 16 percent of customers in PECO's territory have opted\rto switch their provider. So, TNPC has an uphill climb, to say the least,\rin making any inroads at capturing a lock=01*and making money=01*in the ret=\rail\rmarket. Second, the only way that I can see TNPC making it at all is if\rthey continue to buy customers like they did from Columbia Energy Group.\rThere are big questions surrounding whether the company will be able to\rdo this or not, and much of its success hinges on this uncertainty.\r Third, and perhaps most serious of all, is TNPC's vulnerability on the\rtechnology side of its operation. TNPC has entered into a 10-year revenue\rmanagement and customer care agreement with IBM Global Services, under\rwhich IBM will manage the company's online commerce and billing application=\rs.\rIBM's track record in developing customer care systems is less than stellar=\r.\rIn fact, PG&amp;E initiated a lawsuit against IBM a few years ago when the\rutility had to pull the plug on a massive $1000 million customer information\rsystem (CIS), employed by IBM, which it claimed was ineffective. IBM has\rpartnered with SCT to provide the infrastructure to be used by TNPC. Under\ran agreement between IBM Global Services and SCT, the SCT Banner CIS will\rbe integrated into a number of back-office IT solutions under development\rby IBM for TNPC. Experts in the CIS industry have questioned whether SCT's\rBanner CIS can handle over one million customers. If it cannot, this will\rsurely limit TNPC's growth potential.\r Moreover, although TNPC's IPO signals a strong future, there are many=20\runcertainties\rsurrounding this nascent operation. As one of the few major players in\rthe energy retail market, TNPC has very few competitors, with the possible\rexceptions of NewEnergy or GreenMountain. Another competitor is also emergi=\rng\rin Britain's Centrica, which plans to expand in North America after its\rrecent acquisition of Canadian retail gas supplier Direct Energy.=20\rConsequently,\rthe coming year could either make or break TNPC and the challenges that\rthe company faces in wanting to conquer the retail market are extremely\rsteep.\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\r Learn more about SCIENTECH's Issues and Analysis products and services\rat:\r   http:///www.consultrci.com/web/rciweb.nsf/web/Depts-IA.html\r =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\r SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

As I mentioned to Alice Weekley, I am unfamiliar with the recent amendments referenced requiring the notice for projects that do not actually cross reservation property. The amendment does not surprise me though.   In the past, for example, during the Transwestern expansion in '91, we developed a comprehensive NAGPRA plan with tribes whose reservations we crossed, yet neighboring tribes were included---the thinking by the various State Historic Preservation officers was that unearthed remains (bones, funerial objects, pottery pieces, holy objects, etc) may have belonged to tribes other than those from whose reservation they were ultimately unearthed.   It made for a VERY VERY long and complicated plan and consultation process...not only when objects were unearthed, but simply putting the required anticipatory plan and procedures in place PRIOR to construction.   (It gives me a chuckle: my late husband, Leonard Hilton, who was in charge of the TW project, is likely rolling in his own grave at the mere thought of Enron having to put another of these plans together...Haha!!!)   As I said, I've not read the amendment , but hopefully it only legally requires 'notice'---yet, in my nearly 20 years of practicing law, I've rarely seen   a 'notice' that didn't crack the door or sound the alarm of further buerocratic opportunity!For your further information, I have met Billie Ray Cypress personally and he's a decent and seemingly reasonable guy with a huge casino on the rez ; yet these personal attributes frequently go by the wayside when it comes to 'perceived economic opportunity'.   Chief James Billie,[chief of the Seminoles, 2nd largest/2nd wealthiest tribe in North America] on the other hand, is shrewd in business, dictitorial in management, and personally , has an ego bigger than Texas, behavior to match, and is proud of it!!! ---which makes him a ton of fun to be with if he likes you---he wrestles alligators, writes rock and roll and \"plays\"in whatever stage opportunity is presented him---as long as he can be the center of attention.   The Seminoles have not only a tribal web site, James Billie has his own!!!   Check it out---it's a hoot!!!   He has been chief for about 25 years (and I'm guessing he's maybe in his early 50's).   The Seminoles have recognized significant economic development under James, but he is definitely a \"My way or the highway\" kind of guy---he loves you, hates you, or ignores you---and he has a tribal council that is respectfully terrified of him. If any activity smacks of anything James Billie doesn't like, he'll know no limits in stopping it...remember, this guy wrestles alligators!!! No Joke!I don't recognize the other names on the list, but I think it's clear from both the beurocratic issues, as well as the specific tribal issues incident to each affected tribe, everything associated with the process should be executed with all of this in mind.   I'd be happy to speak with the project's lawyer to discuss this further, if information beyond that set forth above would be helpful.Thanks!---Christie.---",

I'll call you to give you the details, including all the good things I said about you!!!   He was being quite negative about the WGA Feb 2 meeting in Portland, basically saying that his predecessor had committed to some positions that he was not in agreement with, and that he didn't think he wanted to participate.   I promised him that either you or I would call him after our Governor meetings this week to give him our sense of where the positions/players were going to shake out.   My initial thought was that we would want him there as a good voice on our side, but my second thought is that there might be a better strategy play not having FERC there.   As you saw by the e mail exchange last week between Cynthia Sandherr and me, the democrat senators Murray and Cantwell are also following this meeting, although I don't know if they are participating.I'll call you tomorrow and fill you in on the conversationLinda---I also made a small commitment on tobacco issues that I'll need to talk to you about!\n"

Because of the uncertainty of the Congressional schedule, both offices told us to call on Monday morning to schedule the call.   If Ken wants to make the calls unscheduled, we expect Armey and Gramm to both be in DC by Monday morning.The numbers are as follows:Senator Gramm   (202) 2224-2934Majority Leader Armey (202) 2225-4000Here are the talking points*** CONFIDENTIAL ***Talking Points on Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000Background:We have hit an impasse on the CFTC Reauthorization legislation.   On legal certainty, nearly all interested parties agree.   However, Senator Gramm continues to raise objections unrelated to legal certainty for our business.   There are two issues (which we understand have primarily been advanced by Senator Gramm, one on bank products and one on SEC jurisdiction). Majority Leader Dick Armey is trying to gain consensus with the interested parties which include Senator Gramm, the Chairmen of the House Agriculture, Commerce, and Banking Committees, as well as the Department of Treasury, CFTC, and SEC.   Meetings are occurring on a daily basis, but little concrete progress has been made since draft legislation was released on October 9.   Talking Points:We need your help to resolve outstanding differences so that the Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000 can pass this year.   There are very few legislative days left and movement now on this legislation is essential. Do not let the Congressional calendar be the enemy of gaining legal certainty for this dynamic and growing industry.The current version of the legislation provides important legal certainty for all physical commodity transactions (not including agricultural commodities) entered into on a counterparty-to-counterparty basis or on an electronic trading facility.   We strongly support these provisions.The legislation eliminates concerns that our derivatives transactions may be illegal or that our online platforms may be unregulated futures exchanges.   These provisions allow our businesses to grow and innovate.   Without this legislation the industry will be crippled with legal uncertainty and these platforms will develop overseas.   Virtually all of the issues in this very complex legislative package have been resolved. We are indifferent to outstanding provisions, except to the extent that they impede passage of the legislation.   We cannot allow the great progress made to date, fail in the end.If asked, about a possible solution to the logjam.   Answer:   Encourage Majority Leader Armey, Senator Gramm, and Secretary Summers to meet immediately to finalize the remaining issues.   Given time constraints, if such a meeting does not occur in the next few days, there may not be enough time to pass this important legislation.Note: Congress will be going out on either October 20 or October 27.\n"

Also, the Paycheck Fairness Act (S.777) was introduced in the U.S.=20\rSenate on January 222, 20001 and referred to the Committee on Health,=20\rEducation, Labor, and Pensions.

Added after the bill was=\r=20\rintroduced...Mr. Torricelli, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Dodd, Mrs.=20\rClinton, Mr. Feingold).

The call is scheduled for 111:30 CST and will last at least an hour, possibly more.   By way of background, ENE and CalPERS are 50/50 partners in JEDI II - which was created in December 19997.   JEDI II is a funding vehicle for Enron's energy related merchant investments.   Transactions of note are:   3.9% minority equity interest in EES, equity ownership in Quanta, 1000% ownership of East Coast Power (since sold down to 51%), and participation in a number of E&amp;P drilling partnerships and coal investments.   The commitment period was set to expire on December 31, 2000 - and was extended to March 31, 20001.   In addition, CalPERS invested $40 Million in The New Power Co prior to the IPO.   Andy and I are working with CalPERS to amend the current JEDI II partnership in order that we continue our successful relationship with CalPERS.   The Alternative Investment Management (AIM) staff that we work with are very supportive of Enron and we are looking at a number of opportunities to put their money to work in our businesses.   CalPERS hasn't provided any specific questions that they want answered.   My thoughts on how to structure the call is for Marty to spend some time talking about California, Enron's role there and our view of the situation.   Then, Richard could address the regulatory status in California.   I would expect this to be somewhat of a freeform conference call.   One area we may discuss is how Enron and CalPERS can team up on a California initiative.   The AIM staff is interested in discussing this particular point.   The following individuals from CalPERS senior staff will be on the call: Dan Szente, Chief Investment Officer Robert Aguallo, Chief Operating Officer Barry Gonder, Senior Investment Officer, AIM Rick Hayes, Senior Principal Investment Officer, AIM (primary Enron contact) Mark Anson, Senior Investment Officer, Public Equities Mary Cottrill, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Public Equities Lou Jug, Senior Principal Investment Officer, Real Estate Curtis Ishi, Senior Investment Officer, Fixed IncomePlease give me a call if you have any questions.   For those of you here in the office,   we will be meeting in Marty Sunde's office (EB 8889)Dial:   1-888-380-9636Host code:   721367 (Shirley only)Participant code: 6999749Shirley HudlerSr. DirectorEnron Global Finance713-853-4859\n"

He was appointed in 19998 to term which expires in June 20001.   Commissioner Newsome visited Enron in 1999 and will again visit Enron to meet with Jeff Skilling (also EnronOnLine executives) on March 6, 20001.The CFTC has 5 Commissioners.   Commissioners Newsome and Spears are Republicans and Commissioners Erickson and Holum are Democrats, with one opening.   If Newsome becomes Chair, then there will be two open seats.   If Newsome if passed over, there will only be open seat. Commissioner Newsome has the support of Majority Trent Lott.   He is well liked in industry because of his free market philosophy and belief in competition and deregulation.   While not a technical expert, he is a \"known quantity\" at the Commission.   Newsome played a major role in the Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) which became law last Congress.   This law brought legal certainty and modernization to the commodity trading community.   With Newsome, industry is consulted before regulations are issued.   Industry generally believes that Commission Newsome is the right candidate to oversee the CFMA rulekmaking which is currently underway.The other candidate for the position was former North Carolina Senator Lauch Faircloth whose nomination was being championed by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX).   We have learned that Faircloth has lost interest, because he would have to divest sizeable interest in agriculture holdings.   The concern now is that because this is a third tier appointment,   unknown candidates will suddenly appear without industry input.   A quick nomination and confirmation of Commissioner Newsome as Chairman is recommended by many in the industry.Do you think it appropriate to have Ken Lay raise this nomination with the transition team?Commisioner Newsome's bio:http:///www.cftc.gov/opa/newsome.htmFor more information on the CFTC: http:///www.cftc.gov/\n"

The project, which has bee=\rn=20\rin development since the mid-19990s by High Desert Power Project, LLC=01*a=\r=20\rsubsidiary of Constellation Energy Group of Baltimore, Md.=01*will be the f=\rirst=20\rnew major power plant to serve the Southern California area in more than a=\r=20\rdecade.=20\r Analysis: The fact that California suffers from a significant supply / dema=\rnd=20\rimbalance, and that no new major power plant has been built in the state in=\r=20\rover a decade, has been well documented in the energy industry press.=20\rConsequently, the fact that Constellation Energy Group is now close to=20\rbreaking ground on its new plant (having completed the laborious plant siti=\rng=20\rrequirements in California) is a major=01*and somewhat surprising=01*coup f=\ror the=20\rcompany, considering that its generation expertise has primarily been in th=\re=20\rNortheast nuclear industry. Constellation Energy Group has said that it wil=\rl=20\rmarket power from the plant within California, which should prove to be a w=\rin=20\r/ win scenario for both the company and the state.=20\r The High Desert power plant will be built on a 25-acre site at the Southern=\r=20\rCalifornia Logistics Airport, formerly known as the George Air Force Base.=\r=20\rCommercial operation of the plant is scheduled for June 20003. The plant's=\r=20\relectric generating technology is based on clean-burning, natural gas-fired=\r=20\rcombustion turbines operating in a combined-cycle mode. Part of the current=\r=20\rsupply problem in California is the fact that hydroelectric resources, the=\r=20\rstate's primary energy source, have been in short supply due to=20\rlower-than-average rainfall over the last year. Moving away from a dependen=\rcy=20\ron hydroelectric supply may be a smart move for the state. In addition, the=\r=20\rHigh Desert plant is consistent with a national trend that supports natural=\r=20\rgas as the fuel of choice for new power plant development projects. As a=20\rpoint of interest, according to data from the Energy Information=20\rAdministration, California's fuel mix is primarily based in a mixture of=20\rnatural gas (45.59 percent), hydro (21.95 percent), nuclear (18.07 percent)=\r,=20\rcoal (1.36 percent), oil (1.04 percent), and other, presumably renewable,=\r=20\rsources (111.98 percent).=20\r It is rather surprising that Constellation would be the first company to=20\rbuild a major power plant in California in over a decade, considering the=\r=20\rcompany's consistent geographic and fuel-mix focus. Constellation Energy=20\rGroup is a holding company that includes a group of competitive energy=20\rbusinesses focused mostly on wholesale power marketing, merchant generation=\r=20\rand portfolio management in North America. Constellation Energy Group is th=\re=20\rparent company of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), a regulated=\r=20\rgas and electric delivery company serving Central Maryland. Up until this=\r=20\rpoint, Constellation's generation assets have been primarily based in a=20\rmixture of coal and nuclear, and for the most part located in the=20\rNortheastern United States. According to information directly from the=20\rcompany itself, Constellation's own fuel mix is predominantly coal (54=20\rpercent), followed by nuclear (40 percent). Oil, gas and hydro only represe=\rnt=20\ra small percentage (6 percent) of Constellation's fuel mix.=20\r Although coal is the primary fuel in Constellation's portfolio, over the la=\rst=20\ryear the company has become more focused on nuclear. For instance, last=20\rDecember Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation=\r=20\rEnergy Group, announced its intent to purchase 1000 percent of Unit 1 and 82=\r=20\rpercent of Unit 2 of the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant. Once the deal=\r=20\ris closed in mid-20001, Constellation will own a total of 1,5550 MW of Nine=\r=20\rMile Point's 1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The nuclear plant=20\rpurchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset=\r,=20\ran 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland. When I wrote about=\r=20\rthis acquisition last December, I noted that, while Constellation will most=\r=20\rlikely retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company appeared to be=\r=20\rmoving closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio.=20\r In addition, in early 2000 Constellation began a restructuring of its=20\rcorporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments: one=\r=20\rfocused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclear) a=\rnd=20\rthe other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant energy=\r=20\rbusiness was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the=\r=20\rthird quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding this growt=\rh.=20\rThe goal for the merchant energy business, according to Constellation Energ=\ry=20\rGroup CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000 =\rMW=20\rof electric generation facilities by 20005. Toward that end, Constellation=\r=20\racknowledged earlier that it would be taking advantage of \"bargain prices f=\ror=20\rnuclear plants,\" which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing=\r=20\ron transmission operations and thus choosing, or being mandated, to divest=\r=20\rtheir generation plants.   Constellation in the past has justified its move =\rin=20\rthis direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is=\r=20\rcheaper than coal and gas generators and that \"the economics [of nuclear] a=\rre=20\rquite robust, once they are calculated out.\" =20\r However, considering that there is only a limited number of nuclear plants =\rin=20\rthe United States that will become available for purchase, Constellation=20\rEnergy Group may have recognized the need to become even more diversified.=\r=20\rThe California market, despite its stringent plant siting requirements,=20\rarguably offered an appropriate market for Constellation to become more=20\rdiversified. Given the state's environmental lobbying presence, it is=20\rdoubtful that a nuclear plant could have been approved in California.=20\rAlthough natural gas is not a primary fuel source for Constellation as a=20\rcompany, it is the preferred source for new power plants. Therefore, the Hi=\rgh=20\rDesert plant, given that it will be fired by natural gas, presumably stood =\ra=20\rgreater chance of navigating through California's plant siting requirements=\r=20\r(than a coal or nuclear plant could have). In fact, in the announcement of=\r=20\rthe plant, Constellation noted that, having received all federal, state and=\r=20\rlocal approvals, the High Desert plant \"will be a good neighbor in the=20\rcommunity with no significant environmental impacts.\"=20\r The announcement of Constellation's new plant could not come at a better ti=\rme=20\rfor California, of course. Although the plant won't be operational until Ju=\rne=20\r20003, the state can use the good publicity now. A new report from the=20\rCambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) says that it is already too lat=\re=20\rfor the state to head off a serious summer shortage that could lead to at=\r=20\rleast 20 hours of rolling blackouts. \"It's too late for this summer,\"=20\rdeclared Lawrence J. Makovich, of CERA, referring to the state's desperate=\r=20\refforts to ramp up power supplies for the short term. \"The source of=20\rCalifornia's far-reaching power crisis is a shortage. At least 5,000=20\rmegawatts of new generating facilities are required to restore balance to t=\rhe=20\rstate's grid.\" Instead, according to the report, demand will exceed supply =\rby=20\r3,000 MW, which will cause the state to be under an energy alert of some so=\rrt=20\rfor at least 2000 hours.=20\r CERA's report came out on the heels of Calif. Gov. Gray Davis' pledge to ha=\rve=20\r5,000 MW of new generating capacity available in California by July, more=\r=20\rthan double the amount expected just a few months ago. Davis said the new=\r=20\rplants would provide enough electricity to ward off blackouts this summer,=\r=20\rwhich CERA obviously disputes. Davis announced a series of orders intended =\rto=20\rbring online 5,000 MW by July 20001, with an additional 5,000 MW by July=20\r20002. =20\r In any event, as California continues to struggle from a severe supply /=20\rdemand imbalance, the announcement of Constellation's new plant appears to =\rbe=20\rgood news for all the parties involved. Gov. Davis has pledged to support a=\rn=20\rexpedited approval process for additional plants, so it will be interesting=\r=20\rto see which company is given approval to proceed with the next power plant=\r=20\rin the state. It will also be interesting to see, based on Constellation's=\r=20\rplant and others that may be built, whether or not the economics of buildin=\rg=20\rsuch plants in California will prove beneficial. Other power suppliers may=\r=20\ropt to merely enter into long-term sales agreements with the state, rather=\r=20\rthan invest the resources that building a power plant would require.=20\r An archive list of previous IssueAlerts is available at\rww.ConsultRCI.com\r   Reach thousands of utility analysts and decision makers every day.

Phone charges:   Phones are being charged to the person's company and cost center where possible; otherwise to the rent location.   If you are being charged for phones/lines/services, etc. not belonging to you, or the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, please contact the Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\" or move-team@enron.com and place a request for the disconnection of that line, hardware, or service.Data connections:   One connection is being charged for each room instead of one connection for each port in a room.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&amp;T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB, 2AC, 3AC, or JF.   For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.   People-specific services are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's SAP company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the resource using the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.   We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the SAP company and cost center for each employee.   This snapshot is taken about the 21st of each month for use as a source for billing information.   If the billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting FMS/EPSC or the person should be moved to the correct SAP company/cost center by contacting an HR representative.\n"

Any special issues associated with distributed generation that could beaddressed with new technologies;? Concerns about the current price and availability of natural gas causingon new gas-fired power initiatives;? Interdependence issues between gas and electric power;? Any specific natural gas infrastructure issues facing these companies;? The most important issue concerning natural gas reliability;? Leadership in R&amp;D;? Future technology needs; and? The NETL role in technology development to meet future industry needs.Mark WilliamsProduct ManagerFuel CellsWould like to discus some of the following topics:   Fuel Cell Distributed Generation (DG) benefits.? DG deployment allows critical industry to stay at current location even iflocal grid is unstable and unreliable;? DG deployment obviates need for R&amp;D investment;? Fuel cell DG deployment means being able to site power with no airpermitting required;? High fuel cell efficiency reduces operating costs for fuel, which isimportant where gas is expensive.   Additionally,   high efficiencyutilization frees up natural gas for use at other critical locations;? Use of zero or low emission fuel cell technology in environmentallyconstrained areas permits continued use of other   high emitting generatingplants, thus increasing the overall power available;? Fuel cell DG deployment puts the highest quality power in the systemincreasing grid reliability and stability; and? Fuel cell attributes also enhance grid reliability through lowerharmonics, variability control, and voltage control.Abbie Layne Product Manager-Advanced Heat Engines.Would like to discus some of the following topics: New developments in Gas Turbines Increasing Reliability and Maintainability of Gas Turbines Combined Cycle Power Plants Increasing Efficiency Hybrid Power Systems Condition Monitoring Systems.This meeting would be for about 3-4 hours at ENRON's   facilities.

      "body": "\nI had a hard time logging on remotely, so I just got this now.   As you can see, it's a relatively brief \"overview\" presentation for Jeff, not going into much of the detail surrounding, for example, performance criteria and evaluation or job classification (where much of the real work remains).   The main purpose of this presentation is to give Jeff something for the December Board meeting.I need your thoughts on something: one of the rationales I had discussed with McKinsey for this new organizational approach was the need to win the war for talent.   A partnership at least theoretically creates unlimited opportunity and reduced hierarchy in an organization.   It also creates substantial upside opportunity and continued motivation for the business leadership.   My question for you and your team is where are we at risk in fact when it comes to attracting and retaining talent.   My suspicion is that our turnover is farily low, and that it is especially low in the top tiers of the organization.   Where we run into problems, my gut tells me, is that we have some difficulty getting the very best from the very best schools (ie we often lose out to the I-Banks and, perhaps McKinsey-level consulting firms) and that we have a tough time holding the most talented managers and directors (ie we're OK at the top livels already).   Could you have someone do an analysis of the turnover rates at different levels?   We may need to weed out the performance related departures (including those who left after getting a low performance ranking even if they were not officially terminated for performance reasons) if possible.---"

I have also discussed this with Pete van de Gohm and he is working with Steve Reistetter at EE&amp;CC.   Our thoughts are that we really need the DPC folks in Mumbai involved, as they will have to liaise with the authorities.   They probably are already involved, but nobody's bringing me into the loop from that end.Regards,Mike Hicks---",
        " Michael Hicks/EPSC/HOU/ECT on 02/15/20001 09:24 AM --- PhilEJones@aol.com\t02/14/20001 09:25 AM \t\t\t To: Michael.Hicks@enron.com\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Dabhol14 FebDear Mike:I'm probably not going to tell you anything you haven't thought of, buthere's my response:Doesn't sound too good.   These groups have been losing out in the greattransition between Nehruvian mercantile-socialism and the current effort toget India---at least half way---into the world economy.   Some of theirdemonstrations in Andhra Pradesh recently turned violent.   These also werefocused on privatization issues and the decline of the state-owned sector(where these groups dominate).   These groups have allies in the more radicalenvironmental groups.   They are trying to revive their political base and, inIndia, there's nothing like a big American company to focus on, particularlyon the issue of electricity rates---something that affects everybody.Not being familiar with the site, access or connections to the outside world,I can't comment on those aspects.   I assume Dabhol has a PR effort going toshow how Maharashtra people and industry need reliable supplies ofelectricity, etc.Generally, I think you have to plan for the worst, but look for avenues toreduce tensions---open up a back channel to the leaders now, hold anydemonstration well short of the perimeter, but let a small group in topresent petitions, etc.Make sure the state level politicians and senior bureaucrats guarantee thefacility will be protected.   If something really big seems to be in theworks, see if they will put the plant and surrounding area under Section 1444(or whatever the successor emergency regulation is)---it prohibits meetingsand allows the police to break up demonstrations before they get started.Work with the State Home Secretary and district level Superintendent ofPolice to make sure sufficient police will be on site to hold the perimeterand protect key facilities---the control room, fuel supply, plant.Above all, make sure an experienced, senior majestrate will be on siteempowered to raise the level of response---but only if really needed.   TheIndians have a well-developed command and control system for these kinds ofdemonstrations.   Escalation starts at baton charging and moves on to teargas.   If the police are attacked violently and have difficulty holding, themajestrate can order live firing over the heads of the demonstrators.   Ifpolice are in danger of being overrun and suffering casualties, themajestrate can order firing into the mob.   Obviously, you don't want thingsto go that far.   There are lots of tactical possibilities in the early stagesand cagey police officers will use them.These are things the police and majestrates can do, but which your ownsecurity force is not legally empowered to do, at least outside theperimeter.   Your counsel in Maharashtra can tell you what are the legalitiesof your own security force using force to protect your property.   Based onthat, you can take the appropriate steps to deploy your own security force.In the vast majority of cases, these kinds of demonstrations are containedwithout much problem.   Very occasionally, they do get out of hand---and onehas to be ready for that.Hope this helps,Phil Jones, Ph.D.Deodar Associates, Inc.\n"

We are preparing counter arguments for the general public, but do not see much value in opening a dialogue with this \"group.\"   We always have had opposition and we can expect that socialists etc. (some groups have boasted that they will storm the DPC fences on March 1) will begin to rally using us as a scapegoat for Maharashtra's financial difficulties.

In the first quarter of 2000, we estimate at least one eSpeak session per week --- and growing.   Jeff and Joe have personally committed to an Office of the Chairman eSpeak event every two weeks.   Cliff Baxter, Cindy Olson and Tom Gros are scheduled for January events.   We are in the process of scheduling Ken Lay, Ken Rice, Kevin Hannon, Marty Sunde and Joe Hillings.As eSpeak events currently take place in different locations, there is an incredible amount of time and energy required to set up and test the equipment and infrastructure for each event.   It is crucial to have a dedicated eSpeak room.   Preferably this room should be on the 47th floor where the eThink team can train executives in advance and conduct each eSpeak session.   The ideal and most efficient scenario would be to set up the equipment (four terminals) in an office space on 47, where the equipment will be secure and the Public Affairs group can still use the office as extra work space.We request your authorization to move forward.   As we are moving into new space, this is the perfect time to dedicate a room.Please feel free to call me at x39843 or Marie at x39698.Sincerely,The eThink Team\n"

Allrights reserved.Copyright Progressive Incorporated Sep 2000   Early last October, members of the ninth grade girls' track teamand the boys' football team at suburban Houston's Deer Park HighSchool's north campus returned from practice reporting severebreathing problems. That day, Deer Park registered 251 parts ofozone per billion, more than twice the federal standard, and Houstonsurpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in the United States.   One of the biggest contributors to Deer Park's pollution is a plantowned by Enron, Houston's wealthiest company. Enron and itsexecutives are also the single largest contributors ($5550,000 andcounting) to the political ambitions of Texas Governor George WBush, Republican candidate for President of the United States.Kenneth Lay, the chief executive of Enron, has personally given atleast $250,000 in soft money to Bush's political campaigns. He isalso one of the \"Pioneers\"-a Bush supporter who has collected$1000,000 in direct contributions of $1,000 or less.   What is Enron? And what does it get in return for this largesse?   Enron is the largest buyer and seller of natural gas in thecountry. Its 1999 revenues of $40 billion make it the eighteenthlargest company in the United States. Enron invests in energyprojects in countries around the world, including Argentina,Bolivia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mozambique, and thePhilippines.   The company has recently expanded onto the Internet, buying andselling a dizzying array of products ranging from pulp and paper topetrochemicals and plastics, as well as esoteric products like cleanair credits that utilities purchase to meet emission limits.   Texas activists say that the tight connection between Bush and Laybodes ill if Bush is elected. Andrew Wheat, from Texans for PublicJustice, a campaign finance advocacy group in Austin, compares thesymbiotic relationship between Enron and the governor to\"cogeneration\"-a process used by utilities to harness waste heatvented by their generators to produce more power. \"In a moresinister form of cogeneration, corporations are converting economicinto political power,\" he says. \"A Bush election fueled by Enrondollars could ignite in the public policy arena, and consumers wouldget burned.\"   And so may people in the Third World.   Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticizedEnron for colluding with police who brutally suppressed protests atthe company's giant power plant in western India. The plant'soperating firm is called the Dabhol Power Company. From 19992 to19998, Enron owned 80 percent of it, with General Electric andBechtel each holding a 10 percent share. (In 19998, the Indian stateelectricity board bought a 30 percent share of the company, whichreduced Enron's stake to 50 percent.)   For years, the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protests.   \"The project has met with opposition from local people andactivists from elsewhere in India on the grounds of its social,economic, and environmental impact,\" Amnesty wrote in a July 19997report. \"Protesters and activists have been subjected to harassment,arbitrary arrest, preventive detention under the ordinary criminallaw, and ill treatment. Amnesty International considers those whohave been subjected to arrest and temporary periods of imprisonmentas a result of undertaking peaceful protest to be prisoners ofconscience, imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedomof expression.\"   Amnesty's report found that \"women, who have been at the forefrontof local agitation, appear to have been a particular target.\"   Just before dawn on June 3, 19997, police stormed the homes ofseveral women. \"The policemen forcibly opened the door and draggedme out of the house into the police van parked on the road. (Whiledragging me) the police kept beating me on my back with batons. Thehumiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similarto the way I was humiliated. . . . My one-and-a-half year-olddaughter held on to me but the police kicked her away,\" saysSugandha Vasudev Bhalekar-a twenty-four-year-old housewife who wasthree months pregnant at the time of her arrest, according toAmnesty's report. Amnesty found that another pregnant woman wasbeaten and several other women sustained injuries, includingbruising, abrasions, and lacerations on arms and legs.   Amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests included\"the Special Reserve Police [SRP] on the site of the company.\" Itadded: \"The involvement of the SRP in the harassment of protestersindicates the need for the three U.S. multinationals participatingin the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the managementand staff of the DPC [Dabhol Power Company)-in particular, anysecurity staff subcontracted to, seconded to, or employed by thecompany-are trained in human rights and are fully accountable fortheir actions.   A January 1999 investigation by Human Rights Watch came to astronger conclusion. \"Human Rights Watch believes that the DabholPower Corporation and its parent company Enron are complicit inthese human rights violations,\" it said. \"The company, underprovisions of law, paid the abusive state forces for the securitythey provided to the company. These forces, located adjacent to theproject site, were only stationed there to deal with protests. Inaddition, contractors (for DPC) engaged in a pattern of harassment,intimidation, and attacks on individuals opposed to the Dabhol Powerproject. . . . The Dabhol Power Corporation refused to acknowledgethat its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did notadequately investigate, condemn, or cease relationships with theseindividuals.\"   Enron denies any wrongdoing. \"While we respect the mission of HumanRights Watch, we do not feel that its report on the Dabhol Powerproject is accurate,\" says an Enron spokesperson. \"The report refersto peaceful protests, when, in fact, the reason the police werepositioned near our site is that there have been many acts ofviolence against our employees and contractors. Dabhol Power Companyhas worked hard to promote positive relations with the community.Unfortunately, the good relationship we have built with a largepercentage of the community was not reflected in the report. Enronis committed to providing energy and communications services whilepreserving the human rights of citizens and our workers.\"   Enron has also raised a stink in Bolivia with its involvement inthe Cuiaba Integrated Energy Project. The project is run byTransredes, Bolivia's hydrocarbon transport company, which came intobeing in 19997 after Bolivia privatized its oil sector under theinfluence of the World Bank. A joint venture of Enron and Shell owns50 percent of Transredes. On January 31, 2000, a Transredes oilpipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10,000 barrels of refinedcrude oil and gasoline into the Desaguadero River, which supportsindigenous communities such as the Uru Muratos.   \"This problem is Transredes's number one priority, and we arecommitted to continue to work hard to mitigate the short- andlong-term social and environmental impact,\" wrote Steve Hopper,president of Transredes, in a letter addressed \"To the People ofBolivia\" on February 7.   Facing starvation from the Loss of their life-sustaining waterfowland fish, the Uru Muratos left their ancestral lands at the southernshores of Lake Poopo in April and marched eighty-five miles to thecity of Oruro to ask for government help.   \"We subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certainlevels of relief and assistance,\" says Keith Miceli, general managerfor public relations for Enron, South America.   In its actions overseas, Enron has made a practice of takingadvantage of corporate welfare. And it has enlisted George W Bush inthis effort.   For example, in March 19997, Lay wrote a letter to Bush that wassubsequently released to the press under Texas open records laws,asking him to contact every member of the Texas delegation inCongress to explain how \"export credit agencies of the United Statesare critical to U.S. developers like Enron, who are pursuinginternational projects in developing countries.\" These agenciesinclude the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), whichprovides political risk coverage and financial support to U.S.companies investing abroad.   \"OPIC provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost $3000million for Enron's foreign projects just last year, according togovernment records,\" The New York Times reported. \"Enron officialshave in the past asked Mr. Bush to help lobby lawmakers toappropriate funds of OPIC, as well as for the Export-Import Bank,another federal agency that aids American companies abroad.\"   Enron received $2000 million in political risk insurance for theDabhol project in 19996. And it received $2000 million in insurancefrom OPIC in 1999 for its Bolivian project.   The Enron Methanol plant in Pasadena, Texas, lies in the HoustonShip Channel area, the nation's largest concentration ofpetrochemical plants just east of the city. The plant has wonspecial concessions from Governor Bush, allowing the company topollute without a permit, as well as giving it immunity fromprosecution for violating some environmental standards.   Plants like this in Texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogenoxide, a key ingredient of smog, as do all the nine million cars inTexas put together.   Only 7 percent of the more than 3,5000 tons of nitrogen oxideemitted by the Enron Methanol plant in 19997 would have beenpermitted had Enron not gotten away with this under the \"grandfatherclause\" of the 1971 Texas Clean Air Act, which allows plants builtbefore 1971 to continue their polluting practices. Bush extendedthis clause under the 1999 Clean Air Responsibility Enterprise(CARE) program that his office drew up in a series of secretmeetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state, asMolly Ivins reported. CARE waives permit requirements for plantsthat volunteer to cut emissions.   The CARE program is backed up by an act that Bush signed in May19995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internalenvironmental or safety audits. The law makes these audit documentsconfidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility forenvironmental violations. To date, Enron has conducted five suchaudits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of thelaw, according to the Texas Natural Resources ConservationCommission (TNRCC), the state equivalent of the EnvironmentalProtection Agency.   Tamara Maschini, who lives about five miles from the Enron plant,is one of the founders of a local environmental group called CleanAir Clear Lake.   \"Whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of thepollution from plants like Enron,\" she says.   Mark Palmer, head of public relations for Enron, says that thecompany's contribution to local pollution is minimal.   \"If the grandfather clause was canceled right now, we would benefitthe most of any of the companies in Texas because our nitrogen oxideemissions add up to less than half a percent of the total,\" he says.   Last year, the Bush campaign borrowed Enron's corporate jets eighttimes to fly aides around the country, more times than any of thethirty-four other companies that made their company aircraftavailable to the Presidential hopeful.   And Lay often acts as George W. Bush's chaperone.   On April 7, 2000, he played host to Bush and his father, the formerPresident, at the Houston Astros' first home game of the season. Thegame was held in the baseball team's brand new stadium-EnronField-which was built with the help of a $1000 million donation fromEnron. (The company got free advertising, a tax break, and a $2000million contract to supply power to the stadium in return.)   Less than three weeks later, Lay joined candidate Bush inWashington, D.C., for a Republican fundraiser that topped allprevious records by bringing in a staggering $21.3 million, easilythe biggest one-night haul for any political party in history.   \"Ken Lay is a noted business leader in Texas who has long beenactive in Republican politics,\" says Ray Sullivan, a spokesman forthe Bush campaign. \"He is chair of the Governor's Business Council.But the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes isbest for Texas and for the country.\"   For his part, Lay tries to put his contributions in a favorablelight. \"When I make contributions to a candidate, it is not for somespecial favor, it's not even for access-although I'll be the firstto admit it probably helps access,\" he told The New York Times. \"Itis because I'm supporting candidates I strongly believe inpersonally.\"   In January 1999, Enron pitched in $50,000 to help pay for Bush'sinaugural bash in Austin, Texas, after he won reelection forgovernor. Today, the polls show that George W Bush has a better thaneven chance of winning the Presidential election. If he does, it isvery likely Ken Lay will be pitching in for another inaugural bash.

The proposal was detailed in our comments to the FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission on their recent proposed solutions toCaifornia.As the release indicates, forward contracting for electricity is a veryeffective way for the state's utilities to manage the volitility in thestate's electricity markets.   With natural gas prices more than doublingsince last year and last week being up to seven times higher than last yearon the spot market (up to $19 a million BTU vs. an average of about $2.50in 1999), we feel that its imperative for utilities to take advantage ofthese contracts so they can manage their own risk   exposure and theircustomer's risk exposue to this volitility and the associated high prices.(The price of natural gas represents about 90 percent of our plant'soperating costs).We signed a forward power contract with PG&amp;E Oct. 30 and Southern CalEdison Nov. 15 (announced for the first time in the this release).   TheFederal Energy Regulatory Commission strongly encourages these kind ofcontracts --- and we hope that we, or other wholesale power marketers, cando more of this kind of business with these utilities and SDG&amp;E in the verynear future to bring stability to the state's wholesale electricity market.Our proposal is detailed on pages eight and nine in the FERC filing, whichalso includes our other positions on the California electricity crisis.These are also detailed on our CA web site atww.Duke-Energy.com/California.For more information, call me at 805-595-4270 or page me at 8777-364-5170.(See attached file: Nov 27 release.doc)(See attached file: Duke Nov. 222FERC filing.doc) - Nov 27 release.doc - Duke Nov. 222 FERC filing.doc\n"

Call in number is below. Duke Energy Offers Governor Davis Solutions to California's Power Supply Shortfall   Committing to Deliver 3,000 Megawatts of New Supply to California   And a Five-Year Fixed Price Supply Contract   HOUSTON AND MOSS LANDING, Calif., July 31 /PRNewswire/ --- Duke EnergyNorth America (DENA) today offered to California Governor Gray Davis specificsolutions to address the state's electricity supply shortage proposing todeliver 3,000 megawatts of new supply through the construction of generationfacilities.   In addition, DENA proposed a five-year, fixed-price supplycontract to incumbent utilities to address the immediate concern with volatileelectricity prices.   \"California's high electricity prices during peak-demand periods resultfrom insufficient supply to meet the demand,\" said Jim Donnell, president andchief executive officer of DENA.   \"In the past ten years, no significant newpower generation facilities have been built in California.   During the sameperiod, peak demand has risen more than 10,000 megawatts.   This combinationhas caused the state's reserve margin to fall to less than 2 percent, whichnecessarily results in higher prices and abnormal volatility.\"   Under current procedures, it takes in excess of four years to deliver newpower generation in California.   To add substantial incremental generatingcapacity to California, DENA proposed Governor Davis use his existingauthority under the California Emergency Services Act to streamline thepermitting process to facilitate the rapid construction of environmentallyfriendly generation by 20001.   DENA also asked the governor to use his currentauthority to allow California utilities to enter into bilateral contracts withenergy providers, so they could better manage their exposure to high energyprices.   To help solve the state's supply shortfall, DENA said it remainedcommitted to adding substantial generation in California.   Within two monthsand upon receiving final regulatory approvals, the company will beginconstruction on 1,000 megawatts at its Moss Landing facility.   The expansionof the current 1,478-megawatt facility will be in commercial operation bysummer 20002.   And, with an expedited permitting process, DENA could deploy itsavailable resources to construct an additional 5000 megawatts for commercialoperation in 20001 and 1,5000 megawatts for 20002.   To address the concern associated with the high energy prices experiencedthis year, DENA offered to provide up to 2,000 megawatts of electricity to theincumbent utilities at $50 per megawatt-hour for a five-year period beginningSept. 1, 2000.   This would mitigate the exposure to price spikes, for areasonable time period during which additional generation resources can bebuilt.   \"DENA is committed to help bring electricity price stability for thecitizens of California through these proposals,\" Donnell said.   \"We areconfident that our expertise in building and operating power generationfacilities can help resolve the supply crisis.\"   Duke Energy North America (DENA), is a leading wholesale energy servicescompany.

Over a two day period they inquired about production and logistical issues and asked a number of questions regarding product delivery points, pricing formulas, etc.   In summary, they are trying to build a case that the gas and maybe even the crude we sell in India is subject to a 10-12% customs duty since it is produced outside of the 12 mile territorial limit.   They are trying to make the case that we are importing the gas and oil into India.   Obviously this is not the case and there is no merit for such consideration, but we don't want to let this idea get entered as a show/cause filing against Enron and our partners.   There would be remedies such as court or arbitration, but the timing to resolve this is probably 1-2 years.   Furthermore, this issue would most likely impact current efforts we have on-going.   Therefore, we are taking the issue very seriously and plan to meet in Mumbai next Thursday to chart an appropriate course of action.   Once we meet, we will get back to Cliff and Jim Derrick regarding our recommendation on Thursday morning December 21st Houston time.   Cliff and Jim, if you are planning to be out of the office, please drop me an e-mail where you can be reached.Meeting in Mumbai next Thursday will be Chris Walker of Linklaters, local Indian counsel (Saberwal ?), myself, Mike Stewart, Dominic Carolan (EGEP legal), and certain representatives from EOGIL.   We would also like to have Jane Wilson(EIPL Gov't &amp; Regulatory affairs for India) present if she is available.   Jane it is not mandatory that you are present, but if you can't attend could you send me an e-mail where I could reach you if necessary.   The meeting will be at EOGIL's office and Fatima Samuel will confirm the time and place once Chris Walker's schedule is known.   It is my understanding that Chris Walker will be in India on Tuesday and Wednesday working with Wade's group on other matters. This issue came up originally in 19997 right after we started producing gas at Tapti.   At that time we had 3 legal opinions prepared and the legal team tells me the positions were very strong in our favor on a variety of fronts.   After a few meetings and a couple of letters the issue went away and never resurfaced again until now.   We suspect that this issue has been an open item since that time and for a variety of reasons (ongoing activities ?) someone feels it needs to be checked off the list.   Hence, the revived interest at this time.   The reason we are giving this such a high level of attention is probably obvious, but the reason we want to act upon our plan immediately once we get together next Thursday may seem less necessary.   However, today our office received 3 more summons for 3 different people to report to Surat next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.   This time they have asked for our production manager, logistics manager and lead accountant.   We have requested an extension due to the short notice and holiday season and expect to have it granted, but we will not know if it is postponed before Monday.   (If we have to go we will have legal counsel attend with the individuals named)   This level of back to back activity for a government office at this time year is a concern.   Going into the meeting with the legal guys on Thursday, we are thinking that we need to have a highly respected person(such as Saberwal) deliver   our message (to multiple groups, i.e., Surat customs, Ministry of Finance, Mopng) as to the lack of validity for this potential claim and what we would do if they proceed.   By Thursday I think we will have all of the necessary \"color\" on this issue and with the team mentioned above we will be able to develop the right plan of action.   However, due to the level of interest and activity of the Surat Customs group, we anticipate that our recommendation will be to move quickly, hence, my desire to contact Cliff and Jim next Thursday for approval to proceed.   I have included Wade and Rebecca(EIPL) as well as Steve and John(PR) for information purposes at this time.   This first stage plan we will be seeking approval for next Thursday will be to meet with certain people in an attempt to keep this from becoming an issue.   This should be a fairly quiet issue (for Indian standards) next week and even the subsequent meetings that I'm anticipating would take place in the following two weeks ought to be very low keyed items.   However, in India you never know and considering some of the existing press of recent we should get prepared and make sure we are co-ordinated.   John, following our Thursday decision we should probably talk about our plan so if you'll leave me a note where you can be reached, I'd appreciate it.   In summary, the odds are we will be able to manage this and it won't become a big issue.   However, we need to take this very seriously and deal with it proactively and quickly before someone files something without understanding the consequences of the action.   I am leaving for India on Sunday and when possible I will pick up my mail.   I will also be checking voicemail if you need to leave a message.   I will be the Mumbai office on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and in Delhi on Wednesday. Jeff \n"

(EOGIL), our subsidary that owns a 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.   We now have bankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which   made it extremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.   There were a rumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement was still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston.   Attached is a memo we handed out to employees, but basically we said the following: 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to redeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.   The company has exposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not envisioned even twelve months ago.   In line with this strategy, we are placing EOGIL in the market. 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,   we will be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron entities or for sale as separate packages.   We anticipate closing the EOGIL transaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 20001.   3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global E&amp;P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 20001. 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process.   a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process   b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale process   c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and coordination with our bankers and Corporate Development 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.   We told them it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a PSA with a buyer.   However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many people will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers or through redeployment within Enron.   Those people that do not remain with the assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated March 31, 20001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide transition services to a buyer. I would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.   Last year when we were for sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.   If anyone in the media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.   Mike Stewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (0111912228395841) and can be reached at the Mariott after-hours(01119122285777878).   He is fully briefed on our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.   Mike will be traveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.   I will be available all weekend and next week at the following numbers; (work) 713-853-5934, (home) 281-320-2198, (cell) 713-569-4713.   I would suggest talking with Mike or I before making any comments to the media if possible.This afternoon I notified our partners and thr Gov't of India of our intention to market our assets.   I will be making a trip to India soon to visit with the appropriate people in these organizations within the next two weeks.   While I wouldn't expect this to happen, please refer any inquiries from our partners (ONGC and Reliance) or the GOI to Mike or me.   As you might expect, we want to be careful and consistent in our message to these groups.   I will keep you informed regarding any changes to the above.   If you have any questions, contact me at the above numbers.jeff\n"

Since we spoke last week, the meeting date has changed from February 20 to Monday, February 26 to better accomodate presentors' and attendees schedules.   We have confirmed that this date works well for both you and Stan Horton.   On the 26th, we will kick off the afternoon session with lunch at 12:15 PM, followed by your presentation from 1:30-2:30 and Stan's from 2:30-3:30.   You are invited to have lunch with us and spend as much time with us that afternoon as your schedule allows.To follow up on our conversation last week, it would be great if you could talk to the group about Enron's performance in 2000, its successes and stumbles, and how ENE's stock price is impacted.   It would also be helpful if you could discuss the look of Enron in 20001, what its primary busninesses are and how they drive earnings; as well as what significant initiatives Enron has planned for 20001.   I have asked Stan to talk about ETS' performance during 2000, what he was pleased with and what lessons were learned.   He also will share his perspective on how ETS fits into Enron's plans for 20001, as well as what initiatives and objectives are critical to ETS' success this year.Thanks again for taking time out of your schedule to spend it with the ETS HR team.   I look forward to seeing you on February 26.Gary\n"

Daniel Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.   Congress passed the EEA in 19996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate America collects, uses, and protects valued information.   In addition to explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include \"hypothetical\" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) to illustrate his points.This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls (CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of competitive intelligence.   This particular speaking engagement is designed to raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.   All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects of serious competitive intelligence.   Select executives like yourselves are being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that you think might benefit from attending this event.   The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:000 PM, in the 50th floor Conference room.   Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.   Hope to see you there. P.S.   By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the \"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),\" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.\n"

The Houston Forum event will be part of the Kenneth L. Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics at the University of Houston.   (I will have a table for Enron.)The authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the total benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently proposed) are below $1000 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad air days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are around $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including the assumption of today's best technology but no more.   The high costs include a \"last mile\" problem that the proposal of the Partnership's Business Coalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight construction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and future permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).The effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not eliminate it.   Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the current SIP versus without it.   Total job loss will be over 1000,000---about a 1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This \"shock\" will be around one-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 according to Dr. Smith.   One might say that slower growth and spreading the pollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) is not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.It will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election over), at which time an executive summary will be released.   The Mayor's office and TNRCC will be briefed first.   The luncheon will be the formal unveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the study next month.As head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a top-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.   The results are considered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with the peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.   The study is not intended to be a \"whining\" study but to give us realistic expectations and to (naturally) bring into review some \"last mile\" problems where certain SIP measures are the least cost effective.These preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are in and should not be shared externally.- Rob\n"

But before the governor and the Public Utilities Commission cut yet another deal costing consumers billions of dollars, perhaps they should pause to ask the public what kind of system it wants and what it will end up with after investing billions more. Failure of energy deregulation could speed real deregulation that might benefit consumers with real capacity and real competition. But this will not happen if the focus is only on California utilities and their shareholders. The original deregulation deal was designed, as I see it, to keep competition out of California --- and to maximize the rates consumers would pay for every bad past business decision by PG&amp;E and other California utilities. Similarly, current bailout discussions are about forcing California ratepayers to pay for the failed deregulation plan designed by the utilities themselves. Once again, the companies seek to maximize profits and socialize the losses. Following on the heels of California's deregulation, the state's utilities came to the congressional delegation and urged us to protect the plan from federal deregulation efforts. They argued that the deal they cut was good for all parties. Their executives repeated time and again that they might benefit from the plan's cap on consumer prices --- and that there was a risk to them if wholesale prices were to go up. This, they told us, is the marketplace. They were willing to absorb the risk. This was the brave new world of free markets. But markets are never free. From the beginning, this deregulation plan was designed to buy the California utilities time and advantage. Initially, consumers saw lower rates, but not as low as real competition might have provided when compared to the heavily sheltered market of the past five years. Now, because this rigged marketplace has failed, the utilities want again to put their hands into the ratepayers' pockets. At first, PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison asked the Public Utilities Commission to have California consumers pay the entire cost of deregulation's risks. Their idea did not pass the smell or the laugh test. Now the utilities look for a way to repackage their old proposal, including a substantial rate increase. The rationale is that the utilities may collapse financially. This threat is supposed to inspire Gov. Gray Davis and the PUC to quickly put the ratepayer on the hook for the utilities' failures. During the past year, dozens of utilities have merged all across America. PG&amp;E, for example, may not be worth much to its shareholders, but like AT&amp;T, it may be worth something to its competitors. This is the genius of the American marketplace. PG&amp;E shareholders bought the stock, assuming the risk. Why should the ratepayers be asked to insulate them from that risk? During this past year, tens of billions of dollars of market capitalization were lost by various Silicon Valley high-tech firms. Their shareholders do not get the benefit of going to the PUC and getting a taxpayer bailout. The ratepayer has already paid for this energy under a contract that utilities struck with the people of the state of California. Any additional payment by the ratepayer is a financial bailout. Any prudent investor would ask what the return will be before handing over billions of dollars. The ratepayer deserves an answer, as well as some equity or other consideration. George Miller is a Democratic congressman from Martinez. \n"

But if prices get too high, the state might be=20\rbetter off ordering blackouts or implementing proposed new conservation=20\rprograms designed at cutting usage on short notice, said Raymond Hart, the=\r=20\rdepartment's deputy director in charge of power purchases.=20\rGov. Gray Davis took a different view, saying: \"We will continue to keep th=\re=20\rlights on. When you're fighting a forest fire, you don't say, 'Let me see,=\r=20\rhow much is this going to cost me? Maybe I can't write the check, maybe I=\r=20\rcan't put the fire out.' You put the fire out and then worry about the cost=\r=20\rlater.\"=20\rBut Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said the Governor's Office indeed is=\r=20\rcontemplating whether to refuse to buy power at any cost. \"At what point do=\res=20\rthe state say, 'Enough is enough'? Those scenarios are certainly under=20\rdiscussion,\" Maviglio said.=20\rThe water department until recently resisted buying all the power Southern=\r=20\rCalifornia Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. needed, refusing to=20\rpurchase electricity it deemed too costly. But lately it's had to relax tha=\rt=20\rstance because of an order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Har=\rt=20\rsaid.=20\rThat April 6 order said power generators can no longer be forced to sell=20\relectricity to uncreditworthy entities such as the Independent System=20\rOperator, which manages the state's power grid. Because the ISO --- which ge=\rts=20\rits money from the utilities --- can no longer buy the power, the water=20\rdepartment is now buying all the electricity required by the utilities, Har=\rt=20\rsaid. But he said the department could back off if prices get out of hand.=\r=20\r\"If the prices just get ridiculous altogether, there's a policy call to be=\r=20\rmade, and we'll cross that bridge when we get there,\" Hart said.=20\rThe ISO has predicted that severe shortages could bring 34 days of rolling=\r=20\rblackouts this summer. The potential refusal of the water department to buy=\r=20\rultra-expensive power could further strain the grid.=20\r\"On a daily basis we're dealt a set of cards,\" said ISO spokesman Patrick=\r=20\rDorinson. \"It sounds like ... we're going to be handed another set of cards=\r,=20\rand we're going to have to try to maintain the reliability of the grid as=\r=20\rbest we can.\"=20\rHart's comments came amid an increasingly rancorous debate between Davis an=\rd=20\rPG&amp;E over the water department's power expenditures. State spending shot up=\r=20\rfollowing PG&amp;E's April 6 filing for bankruptcy protection.=20\rDavis said generators began demanding a \"credit penalty\" from the water=20\rdepartment because of the PG&amp;E bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, the=20\rstate's daily costs shot up last week to $73.2 million from $57.4 million i=\rn=20\rthe week before PG&amp;E went bankrupt, the governor's office said.=20\rHart agreed, saying several generators raised their prices. \"Every time=20\rthere's a major hiccup in the market, such as PG&amp;E bankruptcy or a staged=\r=20\ralert by the ISO, there's a price run-up,\" Hart said.=20\rBut prices have settled down this week. After peaking at $345 a megawatt ho=\rur=20\rApril 12, prices for north state power were at $243 on Thursday, just below=\r=20\rwhat they were prior to the bankruptcy filing, according to the Enerfax new=\rs=20\rservice.=20\rPG&amp;E, however, said its bankruptcy filing had nothing to do with the state'=\rs=20\rincreased spending.=20\r\"This claim is simply not accurate,\" the utility said in a memo to reporter=\rs.=20\rRather, the increased spending is due solely to the fact that the water=20\rdepartment is buying more units of electricity in the wake of the FERC orde=\rr,=20\rPG&amp;E said.=20\rRegardless of the cause, the increased spending by the water department cou=\rld=20\rfurther strain the state's budget --- and complicate Davis' plan to finance=\r=20\rthe power purchases through a bond offering.=20\rThe state has committed $5.2 billion from its general fund for power=20\rpurchases since January. Those mounting purchases, along with PG&amp;E's=20\rbankruptcy filing and other energy crisis uncertainties, prompted a third=\r=20\rWall Street credit rating agency, Fitch, to place the state on a \"ratings=\r=20\rwatch\" this week, meaning the rating might be downgraded.=20\rA downgrade could raise California's borrowing costs. All three of the=20\rleading Wall Street credit agencies now have California on a ratings watch.=\r=20\rMeanwhile, the state Public Utilities Commission on Thursday ordered an=20\rinvestigation of why hundreds of cogenerators and other alternative energy=\r=20\rproviders haven't resumed production even though they've begun receiving=20\rpayments again from Edison and PG&amp;E.=20\rThese generators, under contract to the utilities, provide more than 20=20\rpercent of the state's energy supply. Hundreds shut down, worsening=20\rCalifornia's power situation, because they'd received little or no money fr=\rom=20\rthe utilities since November.=20\rThe PUC ordered Edison and PG&amp;E to resume payments, starting this week, for=\r=20\rnew power deliveries.=20\rBut the generators say the payments aren't enough to get them back online.=\r=20\rSo PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission will investigate whether=\r=20\rto order Edison and PG&amp;E to begin repaying them the hundreds of millions ow=\red=20\rfor past deliveries.=20\r The Bee's Dale Kasler can be reached at (916) 321-10666 or dkasler@sacbee.co=\rm.=20\rEmily Bazar of The Bee's Capitol Bureau contributed to this report.=20\r---=\r---\r---\rSMUD directors vote to hike rates: A tentative increase of 19% to 27% is=20\rblamed on rising energy costs.\rBy Carrie Peyton\rBee Staff Writer\r(Published April 20, 20001)=20\rTen years of stable electricity bills vanished in a single unanimous vote=\r=20\rThursday night as directors of Sacramento Municipal Utility District gave=\r=20\rtentative approval to rate hikes ranging from 19 percent to 27 percent.=20\rThe new rates will go into effect immediately after a final vote, scheduled=\r=20\rfor May 3.=20\r\"This is quite alarming to all of us,\" said director Peter Keat. But praisi=\rng=20\rthe value of \"a community-owned electric company\" that provides everything=\r=20\rfrom shade trees to public votes on rates, Keat said he saw no choice.=20\rSMUD, which once hoped to lower electric bills this year or next as=20\rderegulation took hold, was caught up in the spiraling wholesale costs that=\r=20\rhelped send Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy proceedings.=20\rThe price of natural gas, which fuels SMUD's cogeneration plants, has risen=\r=20\rsteeply.=20\rWholesale electricity, which SMUD buys to supplement power produced by its=\r=20\rown plants, nearly tripled between October and January.=20\rAnd the weather has been dismal. Rainfall and snowmelt that feed SMUD's=20\rhydroelectric plants on the upper American River are about 53 percent of=20\rnormal to date.=20\rBut during a two-hour hearing, a small contingent of consumers asked the=20\rboard to reconsider.=20\r\"I realize that rates have to go up, but this seems like a big percentage a=\rll=20\rat once,\" said Marian Ender.=20\rSeveral criticized a 6 percent surcharge that until only a few days before=\r=20\rhad been proposed at 3 percent. Among them was Duy Tu, an engineering manag=\rer=20\rat Intel who served on SMUD's advisory rate committee.=20\rThe increase \"cannot come at a worse time\" for Intel, he said, although he=\r=20\runderstands the need for it. He urged the board to act now to make more=20\relectricity available in the future.=20\r\"We are way too dependent on some external force to keep the lights on,\" Tu=\r=20\rsaid.=20\rOverall, a base rate increase averaging 16 percent will raise about $124=20\rmillion annually for SMUD, and a special=20\r6 percent surcharge will raise about $48 million in its first year. Most of=\r=20\rthe surcharge, scheduled to drop to 3 percent annually for two subsequent=\r=20\ryears, will go into an emergency fund.=20\r\"We have to build back our savings account. It's been gutted,\" said directo=\rr=20\rSusan Patterson.=20\rThe rate increases will fall most heavily on small commercial and large=20\rindustrial power users, although households with very low electricity bills=\r=20\rwill feel a sharp bite from the addition of a $5 monthly service fee.=20\rThe flat fee adds less than 10 percent to what was a \"typical\" residential=\r=20\rSMUD bill of $67, but it's a 25 percent rate hike for someone whose monthly=\r=20\rbill hovers around $20.=20\r\"I just don't think that part is right,\" Ender said. \"We should only pay fo=\rr=20\rusage.\"=20\rTom Reavey took the board to task for \"unfair and unequitable\" rates that=\r=20\rcharge agriculture and small businesses less than what they cost SMUD to=20\rserve, while charging homeowners and renters slightly more.=20\rBut board members defended going easier on rates for the pumps that run=20\rfarmers' wells and irrigation systems.=20\r\"We all gain great benefits from living in a community that has nearby=20\ragriculture,\" Keat said.=20\rThe new rates will apply throughout SMUD's service territory, which include=\rs=20\ra narrow slice of southern Placer County and all but the southwestern tip o=\rf=20\rSacramento County. They will not=20\raffect people who receive electric service from PG&amp;E, which last month was=\r=20\rgranted a 29 percent hike by state regulators.=20\r\"If you want to see a bunch of folks who are really facing some stark times=\r,=20\rit's PG&amp;E customers,\" said board member Howard Posner.=20\rWhile there is widespread speculation that PG&amp;E's rate hikes are the first =\rof=20\rmany, Posner and other directors said they hoped Thursday's increases will =\rbe=20\rthe last SMUD needs and that rates could decline in three to four years.=20\rTo boost conservation, both SMUD and PG&amp;E are trying to craft rates that fa=\rll=20\rhardest on the heaviest household users.=20\rSMUD's old residential rates were=20\rdivided into a baseline tier charged roughly 8 cents a kilowatt-hour in the=\r=20\rsummer and one higher tier billed at 12.7 cents a kilowatt-hour.=20\rThe new rates will start at 8.6 cents in the summer, rise to a middle tier =\rof=20\r14.5 cents and top out at 16.2 cents for those who use more than 1,000=20\rkilowatt-hours of electricity.=20\rBy comparison, PG&amp;E has proposed to the state Public Utilities Commission=\r=20\rthat its residential rates be divided into four tiers, topping out at 27=20\rcents per kilowatt-hour. A PUC decision is expected next month.=20\rUnder the new SMUD rate structure, including the surcharge, large industrie=\rs=20\rwill see their electric bills rise by an average of 27 percent, agricultura=\rl=20\rrates will rise 222 percent, small commercial rates 27 percent and residenti=\ral=20\rrates 19 percent.=20\rHouseholds that qualify for special low-income or life-support rates will p=\ray=20\ra smaller monthly customer charge of $3.50 and will not have to pay the=20\rsurcharge on their baseline electricity usage.=20\rInformation about qualifying for the reduced rates is available from SMUD a=\rt=20\r(888) 742-7683.=20\r The Bee's Carrie Peyton can be reached at (916) 321-1086 or=20\rcpeyton@sacbee.com.=20\r---=\r---\r---\rLieberman to Bush: Help California solve power woes\rBy Emily Bazar\rBee Capitol Bureau\r(Published April 20, 20001)=20\rOn a brief visit to the capital Thursday, former Democratic vice presidenti=\ral=20\rcandidate Joe Lieberman called on President Bush to help rescue California=\r=20\rfrom its deepening energy troubles.=20\rAfter attending an early-morning prayer breakfast with legislators and Gov.=\r=20\rGray Davis, the U.S. senator from Connecticut met with them to discuss the=\r=20\rfederal government's role in easing California's electricity woes.=20\rLieberman, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 20004, warned th=\rat=20\rif the Bush administration does not act quickly in California, the rest of=\r=20\rthe nation will succumb to economic ripple effects.=20\r\"No American leader can disengage from a problem that so profoundly affects=\r=20\rour largest state,\" Lieberman told reporters after meeting with the=20\rDemocratic governor. \"I call on the president to get involved. ...

Open government advocates hav=\re=20\rharshly criticized the administration for secrecy surrounding much of the=\r=20\rgovernor's energy crisis relief efforts.=20\rFederal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Curtis Hebert disclosed=20\rrecently in Washington that his board has authority over the deal, which he=\r=20\rcalled \"nationalization\" that is \"against the best interests of the America=\rn=20\rpublic.\"=20\rFollowing that disclosure, Democratic legislative leaders backing Davis' pl=\ran=20\rsaid they hope to maneuver around the need for commission approval.=20\rCalifornia can perhaps circumvent the potential hitch by relying in part on=\r a=20\r1946 case involving the state of Nebraska that did not require federal=20\rapproval, according to Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisc=\ro.=20\rNevertheless, Davis, in Washington for a national governors meeting, said h=\re=20\rpresented a nine-page proposal to U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham and=\r=20\rexpects a response by the end of the week.=20\r\"He wants this problem solved and he's been very supportive,\" Davis said.=\r=20\r\"He's recommended approval on every request I've made and I believe he will=\r=20\rsupport our proposal.\"=20\rAbraham's office did not return calls seeking comment.=20\rThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that will likely weigh the fate of=\r=20\rthe plan, however, is independent of Abraham's office. Even so, Abraham is=\r=20\rpart of an energy policy team appointed by Bush, and Davis views Abraham's=\r=20\rsupport of the proposal as a potential key to a federal nod.=20\rDavis' history with the commission won't help his efforts.

The ISO calculated the suppliers'=20\rcosts, threw in a 10 percent profit margin --- and concluded that the=20\rgenerators had sold scads of power at unreasonable prices.=20\rThe state's grid managers want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to=\r=20\rseek refunds from the generators if regulators confirm that overcharging to=\rok=20\rplace. But some doubt the FERC will act, given its past reluctance to set=\r=20\rprice controls or interfere in California's energy markets.=20\r\"I don't think they have a whole lot of chance with FERC,\" said Severin=20\rBorenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute.=20\rFederal officials, he said, \"are likely to bend over backward to excuse the=\r=20\rprices.\"=20\rWholesalers also doubted the ISO report would lead anywhere, saying it left=\r=20\rout significant, legitimate costs of selling electricity to California.=20\rSuppliers had the right to charge a \"credit premium\" as the risks of=20\rnonpayment began rising, said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading=20\rForum. Not only did the ISO become an uncreditworthy buyer --- because it go=\rt=20\rits money from Edison and PG&amp;E --- but the whole political climate in=20\rCalifornia added to the wholesalers' risks, Ackerman said.=20\rWhether or not the ISO filing prompts action from federal regulators, it=20\rcould help lawmakers pressure the generators.=20\rState Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said he wants to sort out how much of the=\r=20\rdebts piled up by PG&amp;E and Edison since last summer were the result of=20\relectricity prices that could be deemed \"unjust and unreasonable\" under=20\rfederal and state laws.=20\r\"Since every regulatory body has concluded those costs were unjust and=20\runreasonable, a portion, if not a very significant part of that past debt=\r=20\rought to be forgiven,\" Dunn said.=20\rSome analysts say state leaders can't push the generators too far, since th=\rey=20\rdepend on energy companies to build new power plants --- a supply boost that=\r=20\rtheoretically would lower energy prices.=20\rDunn acknowledges that is a concern, but says the Legislature also can't=20\rafford to ignore charges that generators have gouged utilities and=20\rratepayers.=20\r\"That is the game of chicken we are in now,\" Dunn said. \"And up to this=20\rpoint, it is only the state that has blinked.\"=20\rThe issue of debt forgiveness could become moot if Davis can't strike a dea=\rl=20\rwith PG&amp;E and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric to buy their transmission systems.=\r=20\rLast week, Davis announced a tentative agreement to acquire Edison's power=\r=20\rlines for $2.7 billion and is reportedly close to coming to terms with SDG&amp;=\rE.=20\rBut PG&amp;E has so far rejected the governor's overtures, and on Thursday it=\r=20\radded to a litany of financial woes.

An alternative scenario has one or all of the=20\rgenerators going to court to force PG&amp;E into bankruptcy, but Bowen, for one=\r,=20\ris doubtful that will happen anytime soon.=20\r\"If they (the generators) thought they would come out better in a bankruptc=\ry,=20\rwe would be there already,\" said Bowen, whose committee would have to appro=\rve=20\rany rescue plan for the utilities.=20\r\"So that means they have to give.

On Thursday, the Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District board set aside for further study later this month a motion by Director Gary Kelley to ensure that both the lines and the actual power plant that make up a $450 million proposal from Enron North America proceed together. But residents of La Cresta, a mountaintop community near where the lines might run, did not care whether the plant and lines happened together. Many of them do not want the lines to be there at all. \"We are resolved to keep power lines out of the Cleveland National Forest and the San Mateo Wilderness Area,\" said La Cresta resident Bill Stockmar. \"Our constituents and the local residents impacted by the proposed project are outraged and respectfully demand immediate intervention to stop this project at the planning level.\" As it stands now, the power lines from the hydroelectric plant would run from Temescal Canyon to Camp Pendleton along the ridge line of the Elsinore Mountains just west of the lake. Those lines could run in a narrow strip of forest land just west of the La Cresta community. Enron project manager Rob Bakondy said the final determination of where the lines might run is not set, but he said the power lines could be built at least a year before the plant itself. Besides serving the hydroelectric plant, the power lines could be used to replace lines San Diego Gas and Electric wants to build through Murrieta and Temecula to bring power to San Diego. The water district also announced it is considering financing and building the lines itself. District General Manager John Rossi said Wednesday that it was too early to say exactly how the lines would be built, but that the district's building or owning the lines, or both, in cooperation with Enron is \"one possibility.\" Board President Kris Anderson said it is too early to tell whether it would benefit the district to become so directly involved in the project. But he said the district would be able to borrow the approximately $50 million needed to build the lines at a lower interest rate than a private company could get. That difference, Anderson said, could mean extra dollars for the district. How Governor Davis' proposal to purchase thousands of miles of transmission lines from the ailing utilities will affect the project is not yet clear, said Enron spokeswoman Kathy Russeth. The timing of the construction of the project, if it is approved by state and federal regulators, will not be finally known until a contract between Enron and the water district has been agreed upon. That is expected to happen by the end of May.---GOP in a fix over power crisisLeaders seek solutions that won't undercut past support for deregulation By Daniel BorensteinTIMES POLITICAL EDITOR California Republican Party leaders are trying desperately to politicize the state's electricity crisis by blaming Gray Davis, but it seems that the harder they try the more popular the Democratic governor becomes. The latest GOP push will come today when party leaders, meeting in Sacramento for the start of their three-day state convention, hold a hastily organized workshop on energy. \"We should be explaining to California that Gray Davis was asleep at the switch last year,\" said one of the scheduled speakers, Republican strategist Dan Schnur. \"But that message can only work if it's coupled with a proposal for an alternative solution.\" So far, that hasn't happened. For all the complaints about Davis, Republicans are moving even slower. Looking to 20002, when Davis will stand for re-election, the GOP has run radio ads attacking the governor for delays. But the party has yet to distinguish itself with a solid plan of its own. \"If Republicans are able in the next couple of months to articulate a clear plan, which is different from the Democratic plan, yes, we can use it as a political message,\" said Stuart DeVeaux, spokesman for the California Republican Party. \"Are Republicans in Sacramento going to come up with a plan that articulates a future for our energy problem? I'm not telling you it's going to be revealed this weekend. It's my hope it will be articulated this weekend.\" Republicans are caught in an ideological quagmire. Pushing for re-regulation of electricity conflicts with the party's basic tenet of less government interference. Conversely, arguing for full deregulation puts Republicans at odds with a solid majority of Californians. A Los Angeles Times poll taken Feb. 14-15 found that 60 percent of Californians want to go back to a regulated electricity industry, while 25 percent are opposed. The GOP problem is exacerbated because there is no easy policy solution to the energy mess, said Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College. \"It's difficult to see how we get out of this situation without considerable cost. If there were a silver bullet, somebody would have found it by now.\" Republicans have attacked Davis for his plan to buy power lines from private utilities. \"Everybody agrees there's $1 billion or $2 billion in deferred maintenance,\" said GOP consultant Sal Russo, another speaker at the party's convention today. \"We need to be in this business like a hole in the head.\" But the Times poll found that Californians, by a 52-36 margin, favor the idea. Moreover, Davis' job approval rating has climbed this year. In January, 49 percent approved and 25 percent disapproved. In February, it was up to 57-26. Californians give Davis better marks for handling the electricity crisis than they give President Bush. Republicans are going to have difficult time laying the political blame on Davis. \"It's 'Murder on the Orient Express.' Everybody did it,\" Pitney said. \"Although you can make a case that Davis was slow in reacting, no one can seriously pin him with the primary blame for the problem.\" The deregulation bill passed the Legislature in 19996 with the strong support of both parties and a Republican governor, Pete Wilson. Senate Minority Leader Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, is considered one of the Republican Party's top strategists. He was also one of the leading proponents of the deregulation bill. For all of those reasons, Garry South, Davis' political strategist, said he does not fear a GOP attack on electricity. \"If the Republicans want to get into a full-out firefight over how this mess came about, I'm more than willing to play. They don't have a very good story to tell.\" For now, Davis' political strength is stable. But the 20002 primary elections are still more than a year away, and the general election is a political eternity from now. \"If this isn't resolved, there is nothing to guarantee that there won't be a voter backlash against the government,\" said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. \"And right now the government in California is the Democratic Party.\" That's the message the Republicans want to drive home. But if they can't come up with their own alternative, they might have a hard time playing the blame game.---Davis says state has tentative deal for Edison grid Updated: Feb. 23, 20001 - 4:42 p.m. LOS ANGELES --- After a week of intense closed-door negotiations with utility representatives, Gov. Gray Davis said Friday he had reached an \"agreement in principle\" with Southern California Edison to buy the utility's power lines for an estimated $2.7 billion. The deal also requires Edison International, the parent company of Edison, to sell cheap power to the state for a decade. \"This is the framework of a good, balanced deal,\" Davis said. \"It's not a final deal. There's a lot of work to be done, But we're making progress.\" The governor said he did not expect customer rates to increase as a result of the deal. Edison did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The state has been in talks for a week to buy a total of 26,000 miles of transmission lines from Edison, Pacific Gas and Electric and Sempra Energy, which operates San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. The total cost of the lines could range from $4.5 billion to $7 billion. The effort is intended to help restore the financial health of the state's two largest utilities, PG&amp;E and Edison, both of which are near bankruptcy. The $2.7 billion price for the Edison lines amounts to 2.3 times the estimated book value, Davis said. The utilities say they have lost nearly $13 billion since June, trapped between soaring wholesale power prices and state-imposed rate caps for consumers. The tentative plan announced by Davis would allow Edison to issue bonds for a substantial portion of its losses. Davis said the state is making good progress in its talks with Sempra and \"some progress\" with PG&amp;E. Thursday, Davis said he will not sign off on any grid buyout without all three utilities' participation. \"I do not believe we can make a satisfactory arrangement without 60 percent of the transmission grid, and that would require cooperation with PG&amp;E,\" he said Friday. PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Low said Thursday night that talks had ended with no resolution that day. \"These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,\" Low said. \"There are clearly some issues where we are very far apart.\" Still, PG&amp;E chief executive officer Robert Glynn Jr. said Friday the meeting with Davis was a \"milestone in the resolution of California's energy crisis\" and said he was willing to meet further to discuss the utility's proposal. \"Each utility's issues and opportunities in this crisis are different, and we believe that PG&amp;E has proposed a detailed solution that balances ratepayer and shareholder interests,\" Glynn said in a statement issued Friday before the governor's news conference. The company said it would have no further comment. The tentative agreement also calls for: Edison parent Edison International to make payments to the utility of about $420 million. Edison International to commit the entire output of its Sunrise Mission power project at low, cost-based rates for 10 years. Davis said that arrangement could save ratepayers $5000 million over the next two years. Edison to provide cost-based rates from generating plants it owns for another 10 years. Edison to drop its lawsuit against the California Public Utilities Commission claiming that imposed rate caps were illegal under federal law. \"This entire transaction, which I believe is fair and balanced for both sides, will be accomplished within the existing rate structure,\" Davis said. \"We will not be asking any more of consumers to allow this transaction to come to pass.\" Davis said negotiations will continue in the coming days. Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield called the governor's plan \"an outrageous giveaway\" and predicted that if lawmakers didn't halt it, voters would revolt. \"The most outrageous part of this isn't even paying 2.3 times what the lines are worth, but then allowing the parent companies that siphoned off billions of dollars to pay only the tax payment they already owe,\" Rosenfield said. The Public Utilities Commission already regulates how much the utilities can charge for power their own plants generate, Rosenfield said. ---By Leslie Gornstein, Associated Press Writer---Utilities Search for Long-Term Fix During BreatherState purchase of power lines under discussion Friday,?February 23, 20001 ,20001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento --- A break in the weather and a break in the energy crisis coincided yesterday, as California enjoyed its first day in more than a month without a power alert. With the short-term picture for power improving, representatives of the state's three troubled utilities met separately with Gov. Gray Davis and his staff to work on a longer-range fix for the power crisis that would include state purchase of the firms' transmission lines. Trouble loomed in at least one set of talks, however, as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it was \"very far\" from reaching a deal. The California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts at about 9 a.m. yesterday. Spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said that with springtime approaching and weather improving, and with some power plants coming back to full output from maintenance, the overall picture is brightening. \"We're optimistic,\" she said. \"We're coming into the spring season, the majority of generators have had their maintenance completed. But everything is dependent on the weather and temperature.\" The last day California had no power alerts was Jan. 13. Since then, there have been two days of rolling blackouts in Northern California and many other days of Stage 3 alerts --- when power reserves dip below 1.5 percent of available capacity. The mildest alert, Stage 1, is declared when reserves are between 5 and 7 percent of capacity. The supply of power has been helped by warmer temperatures in other Western states, cutting demand there, and by an increase in generators on line in California, O'Donley said. Last week, when the state was still in Stage 3 alerts, 10,5000 megawatts were offline in California. Yesterday, there were 8,2000 megawatts offline, a difference that provides enough power for a couple million homes. O'Donley warned that the supply picture in California is still tight, and conservation still necessary. But the focus of attention was turning to Sacramento and Davis' talks with the utilities. Davis announced a plan last week for the state to purchase 26,000 miles of utility-owned transmission lines in exchange for backing bonds that allow the utilities to repay the almost $13 billion in debt they say they owe. While Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric have indicated willingness to sell their lines, PG&amp;E has refused to comment on the proposal. It is not clear if PG&amp;E is unwilling to sell or simply trying to strike a harder bargain. The utility had accumulated more debt than its Southern California counterparts, and also owns the largest part of the transmission line grid. Talks between Davis' staff and PG&amp;E did not start until late yesterday afternoon, and indications were that they were more difficult than negotiations involving the other two utilities. \"They're just on a different page,\" Michael Peevey, the former Edison president who is Davis' chief negotiator, told Bloomberg News. PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Low said, \"These are difficult problems that cannot be solved overnight. There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart.\" Davis hopes to make an announcement with at least one of the utilities before leaving today for the four-day National Governors Association meeting in Washington, D.C. The union that represents some 111,000 PG&amp;E employees, meanwhile, called on Davis to negotiate state ownership of two power plants under construction in which PG&amp;E holds large stakes. Jack McNally, business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1245, in Walnut Creek told Davis in a letter that a transmission line takeover would be a \"grand experiment\" fraught with danger. Acquiring the two prospective power plants, in Kern and San Diego counties, would do more to address energy shortages than taking over transmission lines that need hundreds of millions of dollars in maintenance, union officials said. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio countered that state acquisition of transmission lines \"would not affect one union job,\" as the state would simply lease the grid back to the utilities. Maviglio predicted union jobs would increase with investment in new capacity and system upgrades.

Gray Davis announced that the cost of buying energy may top $3 billion by mid-March. In a move that raised new alarms for lawmakers, the governor's finance team for the third time this month asked for $5000 million to buy electricity in the coming weeks while Davis tries to work out a deal to bail out the state's near-bankrupt utilities. That, combined with money spent last month to buy energy, could drain the state coffers of $3 billion by St. Patrick's Day. The request for more cash came on the same day that California spent its first day in weeks without an official energy emergency and Davis held critical talks with the heads of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. The talks are aimed at rescuing the two companies and Southern California Edison from financial collapse. While Davis had expressed hope last week of working out a deal by today, sources said that an agreement still remains elusive. Until a compromise can be hammered out, the state is being forced to pay upward of $50 million a day from the general fund to buy electricity. State leaders expect that the money will eventually be repaid to the general fund under a $10 billion bond package. But lawmakers are growing increasingly concerned about the short-term impact on the state fiscal plan. Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said the latest request for more money could create ```greater concern and anxiety''' among lawmakers and added that the energy crisis was going to make it harder to fund other programs, such as support for abused children. ```It's going to be a bleak year for other budget priorities,''' said Migden, who is chairwoman of the powerful Assembly Appropriations Committee. Earlier this week, the state's independent financial analyst warned that the energy crisis could eat into state money the governor wants to spend on other things such as the environment and public safety. While lawmakers have so far bitten their tongues about the growing power price tag, Migden said the Legislature might be hesitant to allow the costs to go any higher. ```I can't imagine another infusion after this being required,''' Migden said. ```I think this has to be the last request because we're going to hit fundamental core programs.''' Waiting for bailout plan California stepped in to buy the energy last month after PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison lost the financial wherewithal to do it themselves. At the time, state leaders reluctantly agreed to buy the energy for a short period of time as part of a larger plan for California to sign long-term contracts with power generators. But those negotiations have failed to produce much energy so far, and Davis said earlier this week that the power producers are hesitant to sign any deals until California agrees to a bailout plan for the utilities. On Thursday, one power producer --- Williams Cos. --- announced that it had signed a 10-year contract with the state to provide up to 1,4000 megawatts of power to California. In a bid to work out the bailout plan, Davis and his advisers met Thursday and were to meet again today with top executives from all three electric utilities in financial trouble. The Democratic governor wants to buy 26,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines owned by the three companies in exchange for helping the utilities pay off $13 billion in debts. The utilities are being asked to protect thousands of acres of wilderness lands they own, hang onto power plants that provide the state with its cheapest electricity, and drop explosive lawsuits that could allow the companies to dramatically raise customer rates. But sources said talks have bogged down on the transmission line deal, which PG&amp;E has been reluctant to accept. Alternative energy helps out While talks slogged along in the governor's office, state lawmakers announced that another key piece of the puzzle needed to solve the energy crisis was falling into place. State Sen. Jim Battin, R-Palm Desert, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Santa Cruz, said that alternative energy producers had agreed to dramatically lower their prices in a deal that could save California $3 billion to $4 billion. Those energy producers, nearly 7000 wind, solar and natural gas-fired plants, provide about a third of the state's energy.---Paying for power still a big questionPOWER CRISIS PG&amp;E doesn't like the plan the PUC proposed to collect electricity costs By Mike TaugherTIMES STAFF WRITER Three weeks after Gov. Gray Davis signed into law the state's centerpiece for stabilizing energy costs, big differences remain over how the solutions will be implemented and who will pay for them. The plan, outlined in legislation known as AB1X, was intended first to stop the financial bleeding of California's two largest utilities by asking the state to buy enough unsecured power to keep the lights on. Next, the state would enter long-term contracts for less expensive power that would eventually lessen the need for more costly, last-minute electricity. But the state has balked at buying the entire portfolio of last-minute electricity that is needed, and a disagreement emerged Thursday over what portion of consumers' bills should be used to reimburse state coffers. Meanwhile, progress on completing contracts has been slow, although two were signed Thursday. A spokesman for Davis said more contracts for relatively low-cost power would be signed once the state bought the utilities' transmission lines and other assets, because then the utilities could pay their past-due bills. The governor said last week that he expected a deal with the utilities by today, but that might not happen. \"Clearly, there's been challenges getting long-term contracts, but we've turned the corner,\" said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. \"We've got three in the bank and 10 more once we get these deals (with the utilities) done.\" Also Thursday, the Public Utilities Commission was poised to allow the state to collect the entire amount that customers pay specifically for electricity. But Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. said it is entitled to deduct other costs from customers' payments before reimbursing the state. That would reduce payments from PG&amp;E to the state by about half, according to the company. The PUC proposal was in response to a request from the state Department of Water Resources that it be allowed to start collecting money so that energy companies would be more willing to sell power to the agency. The two Republican-appointed commissioners of the PUC blocked the move, which needed four of five commissioners' approval to reach the agenda. \"DWR's (action) is exacerbating a problem AB1X was meant to alleviate,\" said Commissioner Richard Bilas. \"It is pushing the utilities closer to bankruptcy.\" PG&amp;E spokesman John Nelson said the proposal brought by PUC President Loretta Lynch would have been unfair to the utilities because AB1X allows them to deduct expenses for buying electricity and generating energy at their own power plants before reimbursing the state. \"All of those costs need to be paid going forward. Otherwise, you still leave the utilities to bleed,\" Nelson said. That stance appeared to be at odds with the office of Assemblyman Fred Keeley, the Boulder Creek Democrat who wrote AB1X. \"For PG&amp;E to think it can keep money for electrons it never even owned is astounding to us,\" said Guy Phillips, a Keeley aide. While nothing has gone smoothly, Phillips and others expressed optimism that the state's biggest effort to date to fix the energy crisis would work. \"We think those will be sorted out,\" said Phillips, who acknowledged there has been much confusion about what lawmakers intended in AB1X. For example, Keeley's office said lawmakers wanted the water resources agency to make up the entire amount of electricity that the state's two largest utilities had not secured ahead of time. The high cost of this last-minute electricity --- and the utilities' heavy reliance on it --- is what drove PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison to the brink of bankruptcy. But the water agency has balked at buying electricity offered at prices it calls \"unreasonable.\" While state officials have refused to say how much electricity it has left to utilities to purchase, the state is paying about $555 million a day to keep electricity flowing. And that amounts to about 90 percent of the electricity purchased on behalf of the utilities on the same day it is needed, according to Phillips. The state's reluctance to buy all of the so-called real-time electricity has led to fears that the utilities will continue to run up debt and that power companies will not collect money owed to them. That dispute has landed in federal court, where a Sacramento judge is forcing three major power suppliers and a marketing company to continue selling power in the state. If a settlement is not reached today, U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell is expected to decide whether to extend his order, to modify it or to drop it. Staff writer Andrew LaMar contributed to this story.---Lowenthal returns utility money By Will ShuckFrom our Sacramento Bureau SACRAMENTO Assemblyman Alan Lowenthal, D-Long Beach, this week joined a small group of legislators who returned campaign contributions to California utility companies and other energy firms. He sent $5,000 back to Southern California Edison and $5000 to Sempra Energy, parent company of Southern California Gas. It was a small portion of the more than Lowenthal $5000,000 Lowenthal had raised in 2000 for his re-election campaign. He said he returned the money, as did nine other Assembly members, at the urging of the consumer advocacy group Global Exchange. \"We think it's fantastic that he has recognized that in the eyes of the public there is a very serious potential conflict of interest,\" said group spokeswoman Medea Benjamin. \"We applaud him for wanting to ensure the integrity of the legislative process.\" While Benjamin says it's critical that lawmakers not be tainted by energy money during the state's power crisis, others wonder where the line should be drawn. \"In the real world of politics it costs money to run for office and you have to get that money somewhere,\" said Paul Schmidt, a political science professor at Cal State Long Beach. \"To say that you can only make decisions on things involving individuals that haven't given you any money would result in paralysis of government.\" Benjamin and other consumer advocates say the power crisis calls for special consideration. \"There are not many cases in which they're actually voting whether a company will survive with billions of dollars of taxpayer money or go bankrupt, as they're doing with the utility companies,\" Benjamin said. Lowenthal agreed. \"I thought it was an appropriate request,\" he said. \"These are unique circumstances, and I just think it's in the public's best interest that I return that money.\"---Dan Walters: A power grab by politicians (Published Feb. 23, 20001) Slowly, but inexorably, control over the generation, acquisition and distribution of electric power in California is being shifted from professional utility managers and independent regulators into the hands of politicians. The 19996 utility \"deregulation\" scheme enacted by the Legislature was an initial foray into politicization. Legislation granting the governor more control over the makeup of the Public Utilities Commission was another. But the current power supply/price crisis has led to even more direct political influence over --- or interference with --- electric service. One hastily enacted bill, for example, gives the governor direct control of the now-misnamed \"Independent System Operator,\" which operates the statewide power grid. More political intrusion is in the works, from a state takeover of the intercity power transmission grid to the creation of a state power authority that would buy, generate and sell electricity directly. And while local public utilities function well, a state power agency might operate on the whims of professional politicians. The Legislature, for example, wants appointments to the board that would direct a state power authority, and big state power projects would be subject to the same kind of pork-barrel mentality that distorts other public works appropriations. Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. Clues to the potential pitfalls of a state-operated power system are found in the approaches of Capitol politicians to the current crisis. There is, for example, the unspoken goal of avoiding big power rate boosts until after the November 20002 election --- even if it means running up billions of dollars in debts to do it. Would future rates charged by a state power authority be raised or lowered to enhance the prospects of the dominant party or an incumbent governor? There's no evidence in past performances to indicate they wouldn't be. And then there's the knotty question of who would get vital power supplies in the event of shortages --- a situation that is already looming and could become worse in future months. Emergency legislation already gives the state the right to sell power as it pleases, without competitive bidding or even public notice. There's nothing, really, to prevent politically influential power customers such as big industrial enterprises from cutting their own supply deals with politically directed state officials. And whose juice would be cut off if shortages mean blackouts? Approximately 45 percent of current power customers are effectively exempt from rolling blackouts because they are connected to circuits (called \"blocks\") that also include vital services, such as hospitals, fire and police agencies, water supply systems and communications centers. The Capitol, not surprisingly, is in one of those noninterruptible blocks. With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted to designate which customers will suffer and which will not --- thus taking that authority out of the hands of utilities and regulators. And that, in turn, is generating pressure from lobbyists from all sorts of interest groups to place their clients on protected lists. Should farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or schools? When politicians control any process or system, one can be certain that they will always make expedient political decisions, regardless of the long-term or wider consequences. Thus, we may someday regret allowing the Capitol's self-serving politicians to get their hands on our electric power system.---Discount Urged Near Power PlantsSenator urges electricity rate break for neighbors of generators Friday,?February 23, 20001 ,20001 San Francisco Chronicle As California officials propose building 32 new \"peaker\" power plants across the state by July, one legislator from plant-rich eastern Contra Costa County thinks residents should get a discount on their power bill for having a generator in their backyard. The proposed bill would provide a little payback for residents of state Sen. Tom Torlakson's district, which is home to a half-dozen plants and has three more in the construction pipeline. Under the bill introduced yesterday by Torlakson, D-Antioch, people living within a 20-mile circle around a power plant would receive a 20 percent discount on their electricity bill and be exempt from blackouts. The legislation was partially inspired by San Jose officials' rejecting a proposal to build a 6000-megawatt power plant in the Coyote Valley, as well as Gov. Gray Davis' plan to build 5,000 megawatts of new generating capacity by July 1. \"It's a question of fairness,\" Torlakson said. \"People in communities who are shouldering the burden for having plants in their backyard should get some benefit from it.\" Torlakson said consumers who lived in communities without plants could pick up the tab for the discounts. \"But the utilities would have to figure that out within their rate system,\" he said. A PG&amp;E spokesman said yesterday that the company does not comment on pending legislation. While consumer advocates, environmentalists and power generators were lukewarm to the proposal yesterday, many admit that the state has not thought about how to --- of even if they have to --- offer communities a little incentive to approve a power plant within their borders. However, the state has allocated $30 million for plants that get online by July 1. \"As far as incentives, I'd think most communities would see the value of the employment they'd get and the increase to the tax base,\" said Larry Hamlin, the governor's recently appointed project manager for the plant-building campaign. A spokesman for California's Environmental Protection Agency, which permits plants, said the plan might be a \"worthwhile idea for making power plants more palatable to Californians.\" Michael Shames, head of Utility Consumer Action Network in San Diego said the bill was attacking a \"not in my back yard\" problem that doesn't exist. \"Many San Diego communities are clamoring for plants in the hope that they would bring stability to the market,\" he said. James Peters of Mirent, the Atlanta-based company formerly known as Southern Energy, said the plan wouldn't encourage generators to build the number of plants needed to solve the energy crisis. Already, communities like Pittsburg have cut deals with power generators before letting them build. In exchange for letting the Calpine Corp. build two large plants in town, Pittsburg received the lifetime option to purchase 1000 megawatts of power at below-market rates. Next week, a Pittsburg group is going to begin gathering signatures demanding that city leaders use the estimated 26 megawatts it would take to light residences and businesses to give local residents a break on bills. The group will hold an organizational meeting at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Los Medanos Community Hospital, 23111 Loveridge Rd. in Pittsburg.---At last, power alerts are lifted: Enjoy respite because crisis far from resolved, experts sayBy Carrie PeytonBee Staff Writer(Published Feb. 23, 20001) As oddly as it arrived, California's electric emergency lifted Thursday morning. At 9 a.m., the Independent System Operator, which controls most of California's grid, ended a Stage 1 alert. It was the first time since Jan. 13 that the state hadn't been under a power emergency, declared when low supplies threaten grid stability. The alerts included 32 straight days of Stage 3 emergencies, the black clouds that gather before rotating outages. The clouds cleared on a day when predicted peak use was low --- but not the lowest it has been for the last five weeks. Many power plants were back on line after repairs --- but more plants had been operating during at least one Stage 3 day. So what happened? A little luck, a little planning and maybe a little group psychology, said those who have closely watched recent gyrations of the state's electric roller coaster. \"It is a roll of the dice,\" said Gary Ackerman, head of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents plant owners and marketers. \"If it continues for the next three or four weeks I wouldn't be too surprised. That'll be our respite. Enjoy it.\" The end of a 40-day string of emergencies could mean a few more lights in store aisles or a little less worry about running an electric furnace. Some speculated it might also mean lower wholesale prices. But major changes are not likely in the steady rain of conservation calls that have fallen on Californians since the north state was twice plunged into rotating blackouts last month. \"I hope people don't just go back to wasteful ways,\" said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group. Now that the emergencies have dissipated, \"we don't have to talk about imposing hardships on people, but prudent use of energy is an idea we're going to have to live with for a long time,\" he said. At the ISO, longer days and slightly warmer weather was credited with decreasing peak demand for electricity. Supplies are up within the state, and power imports from the Pacific Northwest have risen significantly, said Jim Detmers, who manages grid operations. Plus, in one of the biggest changes, the state Department of Water Resources has begun getting more power supplies lined up at least a day in advance, he said. Since the department stepped in to buy power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities, it has often managed to line up about 70 percent to 75 percent of what the state needed to supplement utility-controlled supplies, according to Detmers. That meant grid operators had to scramble to buy the rest on very short notice. But starting last Friday, the state began to schedule about 90 percent of its purchases at least one day in advance. \"The operators are able to enter a day with a lot more confidence about being able to make it,\" Detmers said. \"You don't have to search to find those megawatts at the last minute.\" Closely in sync with increased purchases by the state, the ISO dropped from a Stage 3 emergency to Stage 2 on Friday, and then slid to a Stage 1 Wednesday. The stages are based on how much reserve power is left for unexpected crises; a Stage 3 is declared when reserves slip below 1.5 percent. For their part, power buyers at the water resources department weren't sure what has made the difference over the past few days. \"It's certainly not that people are lining up to sell us power at cheap prices,\" said Jim Spence, the department's director of emergency operations. \"We're just buying whatever we can, and it turned out that it was easier to make ends meet.\" He said he couldn't make any prediction about how long that would last. The string of power emergencies has been unpredictable from the start, erupting in winter, when California's hunger for electricity traditionally declines and supplies are usually so flush that plants close for tune-ups. Consumer advocates and power traders blamed finances for the emergencies, rather than a fundamental lack of supply, as fears of utility bankruptcies triggered a descent into market chaos and high-stakes political maneuvering. But basic supply shortages are expected to move to the forefront by summer, when temperatures rise and demand soars. Meanwhile, the brief respite --- whatever the reason --- brought palpable relief to those charged with keeping the power grid stable. \"When we found out yesterday during the board meeting that we were only in Stage 1, we broke out in applause,\" said Florio, who sits on the five-member ISO board. The change also could be good news for consumers, who may one day be paying higher rates for the wholesale electricity now being purchased by the state. \"Getting out of a Stage 3 typically means prices are going to ease,\" Florio said. \"When you're even in a Stage 1, that's a signal to everybody, 'They're short, that means we can hold them up now.' \" ---Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than metBy Emily BazarBee Staff Writer(Published Feb. 23, 20001) Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. Problem is, it won't work out that way. Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway --- many of them on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. The Democratic governor's office scheduled an \"announcement\" for today in Los Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing the state's credibility in the process. \"I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem realistic,\" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of wholesale generators. \"I guess the people I represent have turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. Here's another photo op.' \" Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. \"I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation,\" he said at the time. \"And hopefully, that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week.\" Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. \"These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight,\" said PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Low. \"On some issues, we are very far away from agreement.\" Sources said PG&amp;E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies --- San Diego Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison --- although sources said talks with them were far from concluded. Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for months: In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive \"plan\" by Dec. 1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals. Davis called Feb. 12 a \"drop dead\" date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach a \"consensus agreement\" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay. However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. \"You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool,\" Panetta said. The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a judge's discretion. \"Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline,\" Fetter said. \"The problem is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers.\" In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. One prong of the plan: \"Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities.\" Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, particularly to Wall Street. He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. \"Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, you name it,\" Maviglio said. \"The governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that.\" Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets. Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. \"You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire,\" he said. But market analysts say that ever since PG&amp;E and Edison stocks plummeted in early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their performance. \"There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that I don't think it makes much of a difference,\" said Ed Schuller, a senior vice president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro &amp; Co. \"It's beyond that point now.\" ---GOP Sees Power Crisis as Davis' Achilles' HeelRepublicans line up to run for governor Friday,?February 23, 20001 ,20001 San Francisco Chronicle Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, politically wounded by the state's power woes, has become the target of a growing pack of Republicans looking to turn him out of office. \"Four months ago, Davis looked on track to get re-elected by a voice vote,\" said Dan Schnur, a GOP strategist. \"But the energy crisis has exposed vulnerabilities that have encouraged others to look at the (20002 governor's) race.\" The governor's backers, however, are confident California voters will recognize Davis is dealing with a problem that has been brewing for years, through previous Republican administrations. \"If the Republicans want to have a full-out firefight over who brought this (energy crisis) down, we're ready for it,\" said Garry South, the governor's top political adviser. \"It's a fight they can't win.\" With the primary election still more than a year away, no one but Davis is a sure bet to leap into the contest, but at least three names will be circulating when California Republicans meet in Sacramento this weekend for their state convention. Secretary of State Bill Jones, Los Angeles investor Bill Simon Jr. and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger all have made noises about challenging Davis, but so far their incipient campaigns have been more talk than action. Simon's effort might be the farthest along, but he also has the longest way to travel. A political unknown, the 49-year-old Simon runs his family's investment company and has been active in a number of charitable organizations in Southern California. Simon, whose father was treasury secretary under President Richard Nixon, has brought in veteran GOP consultant Sal Russo to study a possible run for governor. \"Bill Simon feels we need a governor who's prepared to lead and not one who's focused on fund-raising or the next political office,\" Russo said in a jab at Davis. Simon was an assistant U.S. attorney in New York, but founded William E. Simon &amp; Sons with his brother and late father in 19888. The $2 billion private investment firm owns a number of companies and has also invested heavily in South of Market real estate in San Francisco. Wealthy political outsiders don't have an enviable record in recent California elections. Republican Michael Huffington spent $29 million to lose a 19994 Senate race to Dianne Feinstein. Darrell Issa dropped around $13 million in a losing race for the 19998 GOP Senate nomination. Al Checchi spent about $38 million of his own money to lose the Democratic primary to Davis in 19998. While Simon likely would be spending plenty of his own money on a governor's bid, he's working to get outside support, both political and financial, before committing to the race, Russo said. With the state's problems mounting and the economy increasingly shaky, the time may be ripe for a political unknown, he added. \"When things start going bad, people are willing to look outside for a new face, someone who will get things done,\" Russo said. Jones is anything but a political outsider. A veteran legislator from the Fresno area, he is now serving his second and last term as California's secretary of state. He managed to hang onto his job during the GOP's 19998 electoral debacle, which cost the party every other constitutional office. While Jones has long talked about a run for governor, he's still playing coy. \"We have not made any decision and probably won't make one until early March,\" said Rob Lapsley, one of Jones' top advisers. \"Right now we're putting together information for Bill to make a decision.\" While Jones' role as the state's top GOP officeholder makes him an obvious choice to challenge Davis, he's made a number of political enemies over the years, many of them in his own party. His surprise decision last year to switch his support from George W. Bush to Arizona Sen. John McCain in California's presidential primary won him no fans among Bush supporters and could hurt his attempts to raise money for a gubernatorial bid. Money is a major problem for Jones, who listed $1118,000 in his campaign fund last month, compared with nearly $26 million for Davis. Some of his opponents have suggested that fund-raising woes may force Jones to run for an office other than governor. \"Right now, we're focused on the governor's race,\" Lapsley insisted. The real Republican wild card is Schwarzenegger, the movie action hero who would be instantly recognized by nearly every California voter. While Schwarzenegger's publicist told The Chronicle last month that he had no plans to get involved in next year's governor's race, the Austrian-born star was on the telephone to a Los Angeles Times columnist days later, talking about his love for politics and his political ambitions. Fame, however, has its drawbacks, as the 53-year-old Schwarzenegger has found. An article in Premiere magazine entitled \"Arnold the Barbarian\" accused him of groping women on movie sets and generally boorish behavior, while the supermarket tabloids have him on the cover this week, suggesting that his marriage to Maria Shriver is on the rocks. South, Davis' political adviser, gleefully sent copies of the Premiere article to reporters across the state, suggesting that \"the piece lays out a real 'touching' story --- if you get what I mean.\" Whoever ends up with the GOP nomination still will face an uphill battle against Davis, a popular governor and a \"take no prisoners\" campaigner. \"I've been predicting since Day One that the GOP would find some moneybags candidate to throw against Gray,\" South said. \"That's why we've kept our political and fund-raising operation going since election day.\"---Pressure Is on Utilities to Accept Grid Sale Energy: Gov. Davis wants accord today, but Edison executive says company might prefer bankruptcy. By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers ???SACRAMENTO---His credibility at risk and California's energy future on the line, Gov. Gray Davis on Thursday turned up the heat on the state's utilities to accept today a series of tentative rescue accords that would put the companies' transmission systems into public hands.???How far the utilities are willing to bend to the governor's intensified pressure was unclear late Thursday. Given Davis' mandate, a top executive of Southern California Edison said his company is now being forced to seriously contemplate whether it might fare better in Bankruptcy Court.???\"We are weighing two very unpalatable alternatives,\" he said.???Two alternatives facing the utilities are either to sell their electrical transmission systems to the state at a price they consider too low or gamble in Bankruptcy Court that they could hang onto their valuable assets.???After nearly a week of negotiations, Davis administration officials said they hoped to announce today a partial deal that would calm the utilities' jittery creditors and help subdue California's runaway electricity market.???State officials said Thursday they were close to agreements with Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric but remained at odds with the state's biggest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, which has balked at giving up its transmission grid.???\"These are complex issues that cannot be resolved overnight,\" said PG&amp;E spokesman Ron Lowe. \"There are clearly some areas where we are very far apart.\"???On Thursday, Edison Chairman John Bryson conferred with members of his utility's board of directors. But by evening, the company's top executives still had not decided whether to acknowledge that an agreement is near.???Although the utility has begun to contemplate the protections of bankruptcy, it is unclear when, or if, such a dramatic action would occur.???Davis is believed to be offering roughly $7 billion for the utilities' transmission grids. The companies could use the cash to restructure their debt, which resulted from the utilities' inability to pass along their soaring wholesale electricity costs to ratepayers.???Davis has significant political and fiscal reasons for wanting to make an announcement today. He is scheduled to arrive in Washington for the National Governor's Assn. conference this weekend, meet with U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on Sunday, and attend the Democratic Governors Assn. annual fund-raising dinner Monday night.???Davis, a prodigious fund-raiser, is chairman of the Democratic Governors Assn., and the dinner is expected to raise more than $5 million. Of that amount, Davis' political organization raised in excess of $1 million, said Garry South, his chief political advisor.???Any progress Davis can cite could help improve his national political standing. But his aides say it's especially important to be able to show at least a semblance of an agreement when he travels to New York on Wednesday to confer with Wall Street analysts.???On Thursday, those analysts reacted exuberantly to early hints from the governor's office that settlements with the utilities might be announced.???The recently anemic stocks of Edison International and PG&amp;E Corp. soared on the New York Stock Exchange on a day when most utility stocks closed lower.???Edison jumped $1.50 per share, or 111.15%, to close at $14.95 while PG&amp;E gained $1.49, or 111.41%, to $14.555 per share.???\"That suggests that someone thinks something good is happening in Sacramento,\" said analyst James D. von Riesemann of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co.???But some analysts fear investor enthusiasm might be hasty.???\"I'm concerned that the governor's optimism may not coincide with all the parties at the table and it may not coincide with the Legislature,\" said Paul Patterson, utility analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.???Davis met Thursday with Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra, the parent company of SDG&amp;E. Administration officials are confident that an agreement can be reached. But the San Diego company is the smallest of the state's three major private utilities, and its debt is far smaller---$605 million, compared to the combined $12.7 billion that Edison and PG&amp;E say they have amassed.???\"[Baum] is willing to listen,\" said Sempra spokesman Doug Kline. \" . . . We're on the record as stating that we are willing to consider the sale of those [transmission] assets if it helps solve the crisis.\"???PG&amp;E executives had been scheduled to start meeting with Davis at 111 a.m. Thursday. But in what was seen a slight against PG&amp;E, Davis' aides did not summon negotiators for the Northern California utility, including company Chairman Robert Glynn, until after 3:30.???Although the parties continued to wrangle over details, there was progress Thursday on the sidelines. ???State officials announced they had signed a long-term contract for a relatively small amount of electricity with a major energy supplier---an achievement that was perhaps more symbolic than substantive.???Tulsa-based Williams Cos. said it had agreed to a 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. By April, the company will provide at least 175 megawatts---enough electricity to supply 175,000 homes---at times of the day when demand for electricity soars. Such peak supplies will increase through next summer and reach 9000 megawatts by 20006, according to Williams.???The agreement is only the second such long-term contract since Davis signed a bill Feb. 1 putting the Department of Water Resources into the power-buying business for many years to come.???At least 10 other power suppliers have reached understandings with the state, Davis said Wednesday. But those companies refuse to sign deals, the governor said, until the state finds a way to help California's two biggest utilities pay off their billion-dollar debts.???\"As soon as we revitalize the utilities,\" the governor said, \"I think you'll see a lot of movement on long-term contracts.\"???Another small but important piece of the state's energy plan emerged Thursday when legislation was introduced by Sen. Jim Battin (R-La Quinta) to slash the rates paid to alternative energy producers---a move expected to shave $3 billion or more in annual costs charged to the big private utilities. Reducing the amount paid to producers of renewable energy such as solar, wind and biomass power is considered a crucial step in keeping expected consumer rate hikes down.???And, after 40 days of dangerously low electricity supplies, the state got a reprieve Thursday morning when grid officials lifted the state's \"electrical emergency\" status for the first time since Jan. 13.???So far, the state has spent nearly $2 billion buying electricity on behalf of the utilities, according to the Department of Finance, which informed the Legislature on Thursday that it will release another $5000 million for electricity purchases.--- ???Times staff writers Nancy Rivera Brooks, Nancy Cleeland and Mitchell Landsberg in Los Angeles and Julie Tamaki and Jenifer Warren in Sacramento contributed to this story.---Energy Firms Won't Pay All of Monster DebtPUC reverses, taxpayers could foot the bill Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff WriterFriday,?February 23, 20001   Under a ruling yesterday by state regulators, California taxpayers could be on the hook for hundreds of   millions of dollars in power purchases the state has made in behalf of two troubled utilities. The California Public Utilities Commission voted unanimously to absolve Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison of responsibility for any costs above the revenue they collect from ratepayers. The ruling reversed a position taken earlier by the commission, which had said the utilities were responsible for making up the difference between the state's costs and their own revenue. John Tremaine, a PG&amp;E spokesman, said the funding needed to make up the difference could come in the form of a surcharge imposed on customers who use 130 percent of the baseline amount of electricity. That is one option under a bill passed last month by the Legislature, he said. But Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said the governor does not believe the money will come from ratepayers' electric bills. The costs, Maviglio said, could be covered by the $10 billion bond measure the state recently issued to cover power purchases. As California tries to resolve its power crisis, state officials \n"

As she frantically tried to find a newpianist, the radio blared an alert: A 40-foot tidal wave was headed straightfor the beach. ?\"I just will not let this pianist ruin my wedding,\" muttered the bride as she turned the radio off. California Gov. Gray Davis and the state Legislature have no better sense of priorities than the bride did. They've been obsessing over the financial solvency of the state's utilities for three months, instead of making progress on the bigger problem: the huge shortage of electricity expected to hit the state this summer. California's multibillion dollar purchase of the utilities' transmission lines won't add one megawatt to the supply of electricity. How big is the imbalance between supply and expected summer demand? The California Energy Commission forecast two weeks ago that the 60,000-megawatt system might just squeak by with 87 MW to spare in a bad heat wave. But nobody takes that forecast seriously. The CEC's numbers are way off base. California's electricity demand could exceed supply by 5%, or 2,000 MW, on days with typical summer weather. That 2,000 MW shortfall will be made up by turning out the lights in 2 million homes, or a mix of homes, businesses and industry. A bad heat wave would get shortages several times that size. As the blackouts roll through parts of the state every weekday that temperatures are at or above normal, every business and home will take its turn at getting by without electricity for an hour or so. What factory can operate under such conditions? Will the state's elderly survive the heat exposure? The CEC put the capacity of generators in the state at about 54,000, but it used original capacity figures. Most of California's big power plants are more than 30 years old. They can't produce as much power as they once did, so subtract about 7,000 MW from their rated capacity. About 15,000 MW of the state's capacity is now controlled by merchant energy companies Calpine (CPN), Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy (DYN), Mirant (MIR), Reliant Energy (REI) and Williams Cos. (WMB). They say they already have sold much of the power they will generate this summer to out-of-state western utilities. But the CEC ignored that. Hydroelectric generation in the western states is expected to be just 60% of normal this spring and summer. Western utilities have been buying up supplies since last fall. California's PG&amp;E (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) couldn't do that, of course, because they're nearly bankrupt. Nobody knows exactly how much power has already been sold out of state. A trader at one California merchant power company estimated 5,000 MW. In a recent auction of transmission line use, capacity to move electricity out of California sold for up to 15 times the price of transmission capacity to move power into the state. The CEC ignored the sales of California power to out-of-state generators in its rosy summer outlook and ignored the forecast for below-normal hydropower, which depends on winter snowfall. The snowfall season is three-fourths over now, making a hydropower shortage pretty much a done deal. Yet the CEC used normal northwest hydropower production in its forecast. Take off another 2,000 MW. The commission expects 3,000 MW of generators to be off line for unplanned repairs when the heat wave hits. That's California's historic average. But outages usually increase dramatically during a heat wave. Take off another 2,000 MW. The commission expects all 1,000 MW of Davis' recently announced peaking generators to be on line for the summer. \"No way,\" says the industry. Instead of the CEC's estimate of 61,000 MW, then, California can expect available supply of only 444,000 MW. The state needs 51,000 MW to meet demand and maintain recommended reserves in the kind of heat wave it gets, on average, every two summers. People in the industry have been telling the governor for nine months that there's no way to raise supply to meet demand this year or next. Siting and building power plants takes too long. Demand has to be reduced to the level of supply. The current course is to reduce demand through blackouts. Pricing offers a better way. If the state raised electricity rates immediately - a step no longer opposed even by California consumer group The Utility Reform Network - California would stop burning through the natural gas and water reserves needed to keep generators running this summer. Davis insists on solving the crisis without a rate increase big enough to damp demand. Several western U.S. utilities outside California have already imposed such rate hikes. Davis is focused on buying power, even though California can't subsidize consumption of artificially cheap power much longer. The Department of Water Resources is signing 10-year power supply contracts at hefty prices that fully reflect today's supply-demand imbalance. Instead, he should be addressing the imbalance, which must be dealt with sooner (by prices) or later (by blackouts). Raise California rates significantly now. Cut demand, and the wholesale price for electricity comes crashing down. Then sign long-term contracts at the lower rates. Davis is committing California's citizens and businesses to 10 years of overpriced electricity. After that, he says, he will try to reduce demand. His streak of bad decisions in this crisis continues unbroken. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires---Monday, February 26, 20001 Most of West in the Same Power Jam as CaliforniaUtilities: Other states ran their grids at fever pitches as populations swelled and few new energy sources were developed.

GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer???WINTERSBURG, Ariz.---For more than a century, California ran a simple account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most especially water and power.???But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade---in no small part because of an outbound trek of Californians---this simple, supply-demand relationship has broken down.???Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same way---by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.???Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State.???The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reserves---the extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencies---have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous.???Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. Despite the long economic boom of the 19990s, which smiled especially on the West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power plant.???\"We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,\" said Utah's Republican governor, Mike Leavitt. \"We won't know that until May, June, July and August, when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers.\"???In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic deal with California. They want to end an old relationship---that between center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized---and establish a new one that could curtail California's long regional dominance.???In the strange chemistry of the moment---when a once-Republican state government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water---they could actually meet with some success.???\"California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East,\" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California. \"Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the West.\"???Captive Plants Feed Power to California???Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.???Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West.???More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities and Southern California Edison.???A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico.???From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.???And at least until the mid-19990s, California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if plants' power wasn't immediately needed.???\"The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand, no matter what,\" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.???\"If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was less important than being sure you could meet demand.\" And, he added, \"you had regulators watching to make sure you did.\"???The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.???In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest.???All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest.???\"It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand,\" said Jack Davis, president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.???\"Now,\" he said approvingly, \"it's being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money.\"???Plans Go Awry in Many States???Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built.???If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, more plants and, ultimately, more power.???But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned---and not just in California, but in the West in general.???Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.???Its population grew by 40% from 19990 to 2000, according to the Census Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, according to industry figures.???\"Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,\" said A. Michael Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent Washington-area consulting firm.???But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 19990s, mostly as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.???\"I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,\" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview. \"I think what we all worry about is: Are they planning?\"???Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricity-making capacity between 19990 and 2000 by a substantial 444%. But that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 666%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.???Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.???But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a \"razor's edge,\" according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust. \"We have no cushion.\"???Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer.???Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region will come up 6% short. \"Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling blackouts, most of them in California,\" he said.???One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just recently.???They have been perilously tight for the last several years---before the start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams.???The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.???When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.???That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate.???The result has been a string of crises across the West.???In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 3000%. Most of the project's 13,3000 poor customers say they can't pay.???In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.???In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open market---and the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves.???Deep Hostility in Rest of the West???The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor, they are less guarded at home.???The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that \"California, if given the chance, would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly.\" (In an interview, he denied having made the remark.)???Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, \"plundered provinces\"---terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.???But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. \"A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage,\" said Stanford historian Richard White.???The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.???In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity. ???\"The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the region's consent,\" Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said in an interview.???In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are considering another eight.???Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders.???(Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California.)???Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst nightmare---recalling power that Utah produces for the state.???Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.???But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with proper notice, to recall power for local use.???The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general manager Reed Searle.???Although the amounts are trivial---the Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity---Leavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state, including a 5000- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build.???\"California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that,\" the Utah governor said. \"That's fine and we're willing to do that.???\"But,\" he added, \"there comes a point at which, if demand grows too large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren.\"???If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers.--- ???Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed to this report.---Monday, February 26, 20001 Plant Construction Stalled Over State's Effort to Revise Contracts Power: Small \"peaker\" generators could help California get through the summer without blackouts. By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer ???SACRAMENTO---The construction of a fleet of small power plants---capable of supplying 1 million homes---is being stalled because of a dispute between state officials and the plant builders.???Two weeks ago, Gov. Gray Davis toured a power plant under construction among the orchards of Sutter County. He ordered state Energy Commission regulators to roll out the red carpet for anybody willing to quickly build small, sometimes temporary, generators called \"peakers\" to help the state get through next summer without blackouts.???Yet plans for 29 such plants, which have been in the works since last fall, have been slowed by the state, according to the companies hired to build the plants. The problem, they say, is that the California Department of Water Resources, which was pushed into the electricity business on an emergency basis last month, is trying to amend 4-month-old contracts for construction of peaker plants.???State officials say the original contracts gave too much to the plant builders, and they want to save the taxpayers money by revising the terms.???\"We're not delaying any construction,\" said Davis spokesman Phil Trounstine. \"We're providing financial assurances for the generators and protections for California consumers.\"???\"There's no reason,\" he added, \"that these guys can't rework these contracts and get these plants up and running on time.\"???But peaker plant operators say the contract revisions probably will slow down construction. ???Last week, Harold Dittmer found out that the department wants to stretch to 10 years the terms of what had been a three-year contract with his company, Sacramento-based Wellhead Power.???He said he is scrambling to alter land and equipment leases and isn't certain he will get his four power plants installed in the Central Valley by the target dates of May and July.???\"Having to renegotiate the agreements adds uncertainty, and uncertainty adds time,\" Dittmer said.???Some of the other eight companies with contracts to build peakers say they've also been asked to alter their contracts.???\"The projects will not be done in June, as originally contemplated,\" said Dale Fredericks, chief executive officer of DG Power Inc. in the San Francisco suburb of Walnut Creek. His company intends to build seven small plants around the state with the combined capacity to supply more than 340,000 homes.???These gas-fired plants, some so small they fit on the back of a big-rig truck, are designed to run a few hours at times of heightened demand. Most are slated for construction on existing industrial sites, such as utility substations.???Officials of the Department of Water Resources did not return calls for comment. Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said department officials are confident that the plants will all be finished this summer. He said the agency---thrust into the power-buying business as a result of the near-bankruptcy of the state's two biggest utilities---wants to amend the original contracts to save money.???\"We're simply trying to get the best prices for taxpayers,\" Maviglio said.???But in slowing down the plant construction, the department's action undermines the governor's campaign to quickly expand the state's power production. Two weeks ago, Davis ordered the Energy Commission to offer licensing of such plants in 21 days or less. On Wednesday, the commission published a list of 32 sites around the state that could, by its estimation, quickly and easily accommodate a peaker plant.???Among these sites, targeted for proximity to transmission lines and natural gas supplies, are an airport in Kern County, the port of Long Beach and a cardboard recycling plant in Ontario.???\"Our target is 1,000 megawatts,\" said Energy Commission spokeswoman Claudia Chandler.???Fredericks, the power plant builder, said the state's best shot of getting that much peaking power built by this summer is through existing contracts like his. So many plants are under construction around the country that there is often a long wait for delivery of the turbines, compressors and other crucial components of a power plant, he said.???\"We've been working on this six months, so we have equipment lined up,\" said Fredericks, who searched worldwide for the parts he needed. \"But somebody coming in right now probably can't find the equipment.\"???His company and eight others signed contracts last fall with the California Independent System Operator. That nonprofit agency, based east of Sacramento in Folsom, was established under the state's 19996 deregulation plan to balance the flow of electricity on the transmission grid reaching 75% of California.???Typically, Cal-ISO wouldn't be in the business of soliciting construction of power plants. But a scarcity of supply complicates Cal-ISO's job. Managers looking ahead to the summer of 20001 predicted last year that the state would be short of electricity by one-fifth of what it needs on those hottest afternoons when demand for power spikes upward.???Warning of \"a very substantial risk\" of rotating blackouts in the summer of 20001, Cal-ISO officials signed contracts last October and November for 29 small power plants to be built by June. The plants would be capable of providing 1,279 megawatts of peak-time electricity---enough to supply more than 1 million homes---at a cost of $214 million a year for three years.???That would amount to about $6 per California household per year, Cal-ISO staff figured.???\"These costs,\" wrote Cal-ISO management in a memo to its policy-making board of governors, \"should be weighed against the financial, social and human costs\" associated with blackouts.???\"We saw the summer of 20001 coming like a freight train,\" said Brian Theaker, manager of reliability contracts at Cal-ISO. \"And we gulped and swallowed and said, 'We've got to do this because nobody else is.' \"???Those contracts were signed despite the misgivings of two appointees of the governor.???In an Oct. 26 letter, Public Utilities Commission Chairwoman Loretta Lynch and Michael Kahn, head of the Electricity Oversight Board, complained that the contracts for peaker plants seemed too expensive.???They urged Cal-ISO to refrain from signing the contracts until the PUC could check whether Edison and PG&amp;E were willing to build the plants more cheaply.???But the utilities came forward with no such plans, and the Cal-ISO board approved the contracts.???Under those contracts, the plants would be required to produce electricity for 5000 hours at most this summer, when called upon to do so by Cal-ISO.???But work on the plants tapered off in January, when the deteriorating financial condition of Edison and PG&amp;E threw the future of Cal-ISO into jeopardy.???Cal-ISO doesn't actually buy electricity. It bills utilities for the power it needs to balance the grid. So as Edison and PG&amp;E spiraled toward bankruptcy in December, Cal-ISO lost its credit-worthy status, and companies---and their lenders---feared doing business with the agency.???To calm those fears and to get construction underway, the Department of Water Resources has offered to replace Cal-ISO in the contracts. But that has not yet happened, as department officials seek to change the contracts. The state has hired a Massachusetts firm, Navigant, to renegotiate the deals.???\"If DWR would just assume the contracts as they are, we'd all be in high gear,\" Dittmer said.---Saturday, February 24, 20001 Electricity Crisis Dims Firms' Opinion of State Polling: Four out of 10 small companies are less happy about California's business climate, and 20% are looking at a move. By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer ???Four out of 10 small companies say California's electricity crisis has dimmed their view of the state as a place to do business, and nearly two in 10 are exploring a move to another state, according to a survey released Friday by the National Federation of Independent Business.???The survey, one of the first to attempt to ???gauge the toll on business from the energy meltdown, follows other polls issued this week that illuminate vastly different views of deregulation and the retail competition that it is intended to spark.???Most California consumers said they still favor electricity competition, in a survey conducted by J.D. Power &amp; Associates. More than half of the 750 people interviewed said they did not understand deregulation, but 64% said the state should continue to support competition in the electricity industry.???But another survey, by the Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton consulting firm, found that most commercial and industrial companies were \"wholly unprepared\" to take advantage of retail electricity competition around the nation and that few switched to new electricity providers. While most of those that switched saved money on their electricity bills, 10% paid the same or even more for power.???If nothing else, the three surveys underscore that problems in the electricity industry are confusing, expensive, frustrating and disruptive for all involved.???\"This is a major issue, the No. 1 issue, for small business,\" said Martyn Hopper, state director for the National Federation of Independent Business, an advocacy group for small companies.???Although California businesses have raised serious concerns about both energy costs and supply, the state's economy so far has shown only limited damage.???Just more than 20% of respondents said they had been hit by blackouts since the beginning of the year, the telephone survey of 523 small businesses conducted for NFIB by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research of Maryland found.???But there clearly was some confusion among those answering the survey about whether these were the rotating blackouts that hit Northern and Central California on Jan. 17 and 18, or whether these were voluntary power outages under utility programs that ask businesses to cut electricity usage when supplies are extremely tight. For example, 9.4% of respondents in the Los Angeles area said they had experienced a blackout when no forced outages occurred south of Bakersfield.???For whatever reason the lights went out, more than half of the businesses were forced to severely curtail or terminate business operations for the entire blackout.???About one-third said they lost sales, nearly 21% said materials were damaged or destroyed, and nearly 40% had to absorb wage costs for work not done.???Businesses were almost evenly split on whether the blackouts would lower earnings, and nearly eight out of 10 were not planning any layoffs as a result.???But the electricity mess has damaged the companies' views of California as a secure business home. Slightly more than 43% said the power problem had changed their views about California as a place to do business, and nearly 71% said it had shaken their confidence in the state's political and business leadership.???But a whopping 69% said they have no intention of moving their companies to another state.???\"Our members don't have the option of moving to Texas or Colorado\" in search of cheaper or more reliable power, Hopper said. \"A lot of them are family owned and minority owned . . . and they want to do business in California.\"---NEWS ANALYSIS Once Accused of Inactivity, Davis Now Takes Lead Role The governor has shifted into campaign mode in the power crisis, trying to convince voters, critics and investors that he can steer the state toward recovery. By DAN MORAIN and RONE TEMPEST, Times Staff Writers ???Just a month ago, Gov. Gray Davis was under fire for failing to move quickly and forcefully to quell California's energy crisis.???But in recent weeks the governor has moved into campaign mode---touring power plants with TV cameras in tow and issuing a steady stream of proclamations that declare victories in the power battle.???His mission is to convince voters in California, analysts on Wall Street, and politicos across the country that he is up to solving what he insists on calling the energy \"challenge.\"???Davis is doing what any politician on the hustings would do: Head out to a power plant under construction as he did recently, put on a hard hat and tell gathered reporters that he is working to make sure the state will have enough power to meet its needs.???\"Because it is so complicated and hydra-headed,\" said Garry South, Davis' chief political consultant, \"we really felt he had to move out and simplify and objectify what he is doing.\" Otherwise, people simply wouldn't see that he had a plan to solve the problem.???\"This isn't rocket science,\" South added. \"The communication tools and techniques that any elected official has\" don't differ that much \"from what is available in a campaign.\"???Davis arrived Friday night in Washington, D.C., on the first leg of a five-day East Coast trip that will take him to Wall Street. In recent weeks, he has compiled a story to tell of actions he has taken that suggest he is on top of the situation.???Critics counter that his plans are half measures. On Friday, for example, he did not announce a final deal to rescue the state's three private utilities from their multibillion dollar debt. Rather, he proclaimed that he had the framework of an accord with one of the utilities, Southern California Edison.???However, the goal is to show progress, even if it's incremental.???\"The public just wants it solved,\" said Democratic political consultant Darry Sragow, who doesn't work for Davis. \"He is working to show that he is working to solve the problem. If there is a view that no one is solving his problem, all hell will break loose.\"???The actions are a far cry from the situation in January, when utility executives, power generators and lawmakers were loudly blaming Davis for failing to recognize the power crisis and for not taking steps soon enough to get California on course for recovery.???Davis confidantes say there was no single event that led to the governor's decision to position himself as the man who would lead California out of the crisis. But the governor pays close attention to politics---conferring at least weekly with his team of political advisors and regularly scrutinizing public opinion polls.???After convening two focus groups on the topic last month, the governor and his political advisors, led by South, concluded that Davis needed to take a higher profile. The prospect of the state's two major utilities going broke also spurred the governor into action.???\"It became important to let Wall Street, creditors, generators and the public understand that we were making progress.\" said Davis' communication director Phil Trounstine. \"That's a big piece of why you've seen the governor personally carrying the message.\"???Davis still has critics, including many in his party. But few can say that he is still suffering from inaction. He is pushing for a state takeover---at a cost of more than $7 billion---of private utilities' electrical transmission systems, and spending money at a clip of $1 billion a month to buy electricity.???Flush with a multibillion budget surplus, the Davis administration has spent more than $2 billion to buy electricity so far. It is offering an extra $4000 million for conservation measures, and pledges to spend millions more to speed construction of new power plants.???Aides say practical reasons prevented Davis from taking a more public role sooner. He was spending most of his time gaining an understanding of the problem, and looking for solutions.???Davis was freed up only after he assembled his energy team, led by former Edison executive Michael Peevey, San Francisco lawyer Michael Kahn, and Department of Water and Power chief S. David Freeman. The trio gave Davis the expertise to negotiate with utility executives and power generators.???Once they were in place, Davis had time to make public appearances, like the one in Yuba City earlier this month, themed around generation and power plant construction---the stuff of photo opportunities.???\"It was a collective view that because this problem was so complicated and abstract, he had to move out,\" South said.???And of course, Davis' political future is widely seen to ride on the outcome.???Lawmakers give Davis credit for deflecting blame for the crisis from his office, even if it means they pay the price. But now that Davis has taken the lead role, he faces risks if the plan fails.???\"I'm convinced, if it blows up, he is going to get the worst of it,\" said one senior Democrat.???Added Sragow: \"We're not talking about anything that is particularly subtle or sophisticated. The governor is chief executive, the point person. If the person who is the obvious choice doesn't lead, there will be unrest, and someone will try to fill the vacuum.\"???Davis' efforts are beginning to result in some praise. A utility executive who a month ago was highly critical said after Davis announced the makings of a rescue plan for Edison that the governor \"forged a difficult and creative and complex agreement.'???\"I think you have to give him points for that,\" the executive said.???This story was reported by Dan Morain in Los Angeles and Rone Tempest in Sacramento.---   \t\t\tCalifornia has appetite for electricity, but is no power gluttonANDREW BRIDGES, Associated Press Writer \t\t\t?\t\t\tMonday,?February 26, 20001 \t\t\tBreaking News Sections   \t\t\t(02-26) 12:39 PST LOS ANGELES (AP) --- California's power crisis has led neighboring states to accuse the Golden State of hogging electricity. But the numbers tell a different story. \t\t\tCalifornia does use a vast amount of electricity. But it consumes less on a per-capita basis than all other states except Rhode Island. \t\t\tThe mild climate and less heavy industry than other states are part of the reason. Experts say credit also must go to stringent conservation measures. \t\t\t```It's true we're big, and it's true we didn't build a lot of power plants. ... But we're not energy hogs at all,''' said Arthur Rosenfeld, who sits on the five-member California Energy Commission. ```We're almost as good as Western Europe, and Western Europe is about twice as energy-efficient as the United States.''' \t\t\tAmong the 50 states, only Texas consumes more energy --- measured by its total use of electricity, natural gas and oil --- than California, the nation's most populous state. \t\t\tHowever, California ranks 47th in per-capita energy use --- well below No. 4 Texas, No. 20 Washington and No. 27 Oregon, according to the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Energy Department. \t\t\tWhen looking specifically at per-capita electricity consumption, California ranks 49th, at 24.2 million BTUs, the agency said. Californians' per-capita electricity use is only 60 percent of the national average. \t\t\tFor air conditioning alone, a typical California household uses one-third the amount of electricity consumed by a household in Texas or Florida, according to the U.S. Energy Department's 19997 Residential Energy Consumption Survey. \t\t\tCalifornia has ```a different climate, so even if you do have warm summers, they're not humid, so you don't have the big, huge air conditioning load you see in Florida or Texas,''' said Robert Latta, the survey's manager at the Energy Information Administration. \t\t\tCalifornia also uses electricity, as well as natural gas, oil and coal, more wisely than most states thanks to aggressive conservation efforts started during the oil shocks of the early 1970s, federal and state data indicate. \t\t\tKey to those efforts are stringent standards for new homes and commercial buildings that dictate such things as the types of windows and lighting and the amount of insulation. \t\t\t```If it is not the leading state, they are at least tied for it''' in efficiency standards, said Ed Wisniewski, deputy director of the Boston-based Consortium for Energy Efficiency. ```Historically, they have been very progressive, and many of the programs we advocate nationally were started in California.''' \t\t\tCalifornia's per-capita use also is lower because many energy-intensive industries are located elsewhere. Aluminum smelting and paper manufacturing, for example, are clustered in the Pacific Northwest. \t\t\tThe industries that are located in California, however, are generally more efficient in their use of electricity than industries elsewhere, according to 19998 figures from the California Energy Commission, which shapes state energy policy. \t\t\tCompanies use just 0.2 kilowatt-hours of electricity to produce every dollar's worth of goods and services in California, while businesses in neighboring states use twice as much, according to commission figures. \t\t\t```The concept that California is a big, wasteful state really isn't true,''' said Latta, of the Energy Information Administration. \t\t\tThere is still room for improvement in California, particularly when it comes to conservation. California ranks just 17th among all states in spending by utilities on energy-efficiency programs as part of their revenue. \t\t\tIn 19998, California utilities reduced spending on energy-efficiency programs, though the current crisis has prompted the major utilities to reverse that, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. \t\t\tGov. Gray Davis recently released a $404 million conservation program designed to control growth in the state's demand for electricity. \t\t\tMaintaining energy efficiency and keeping demand in check as the population grows will be among the toughest challenges in the years ahead. \t\t\tEnergy use per capita is up 10 percent over the past two decades.

LOS ANGELES, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Spot electricity prices in the U.S. West for Tuesday delivery were lower, weakened by the return to service of some key power plants and comparatively light loads across the region. Dealers noted the list of plants returning to service included the 750 megawatt Unit 1 at the Navajo coal-fired plant in Arizona, the 750 MW Unit 1 at the Ormond Beach gas-fired plant in southern California and the 739 MW Unit 6 at the Moss Landing gas-fired plant in northern California . Their return was offset by the start of a planned outage at the 750 MW Unit 3 at the Navajo plant and expectations that the 739 MW Unit 7 at the Moss Landing gas-fired plant would be brought down shortly for a planned upgrade. There was also talk that the 508 MW Boardman coal-fired plant in Oregon had tripped off line over the weekend although market sources said they believed the unit was back up on Monday morning. Loads were reduced by generally mild daytime temperatures across the region although cold nights boosted offpeak demand. The California Independent System Operator (ISO) forecast loads on the 75 percent of the state grid it oversees would peak Tuesday at 29,285 MW, down from an expected peak on Monday of 29,814 MW. Natural gas prices were steady to slightly higher with a range of $12.000-14.000 per million British thermal units compared with an average on Friday of $12.25. Gas fuels about a third of California 's power plants. Weather Services Corp. forecast Northwest temperatures would be mostly 2-4 degrees F below normal through Tuesday, near normal Wednesday and near normal to 10 degrees above on Thursday and Friday. Southwest temperatures were seen averaging 3-12 degrees below on Tuesday, 2-8 degrees below on Wednesday, near normal to 4 degrees above on Thursday and near normal to 8 degrees above on Friday.

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES   LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Key lawmakers in the California Assembly and Senate on Monday were only willing to offer partial support for a plan by Gov. Gray Davis to buy the power lines owned by the state's three investor-owned utilities. Their hesitance calls into question the chances of quick passage for the measure, which is the centerpiece of the governor's plan to keep the state's two largest utilities from sliding into bankruptcy. \"There are way too many unanswered questions about it, both fundamental and logistical questions,\" said the chief of staff to one key Democratic lawmaker. On Friday, Gov. Davis announced at a news conference that he reached an \"agreement in principle\" with Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison to purchase the utility's transmission lines for $2.76 billion, roughly 2.3 times their book value. Davis said he hopes to finalize the deal by Friday, when he also hopes to announce similar deals for Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric . Davis aides said the state is willing to pay about $7.5 billion for the 26,000 miles of transmission lines owned by the three utilities. The buyout is aimed to restore the utilities to solvency and help them restructure nearly $13 billion in undercollected power costs the companies have amassed during 2000. But lawmakers said the measure won't sail through the Legislature. State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Redondo Beach, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, said she isn't willing to sign off on the transmission plan until the state secures concessions from generators and other creditors. She also questioned the price the governor has offered for the power lines. \"There are a number of advantages to having the state own and control the transmission lines, but it's not something we should do at any price,\" Bowen said, adding that the deal should also have value to ratepayers. For the past several weeks, key lawmakers Bowen, Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, Assemblyman Fred Keely, Senate leader John Burton and Assembly Republican Minority leader Bill Campbell, the Democratic and Republican lawmakers who have stood with Davis during previous news conferences, have been missing. Advisers said the lawmakers have decided not to endorse Davis' plan until more information has been released. Sen. Burton, who introduced legislation three weeks ago to have the state purchase the utilities' transmission lines, also wouldn't declare his support for the governor's plan. \"As the governor noted, this is an agreement in principle, and the Legislature awaits further details,\" said Burton press secretary Dave Sebeck. Other Democrats refused to comment on the transmission plan, while Republicans have been the most vocal opponents. \"I don't see how we can pay for the transmission lines without a rate increase,\" Campbell said. \"If you refinance your house from a $1000,000 mortgage to a $230,000 mortgage, you're going to have to pay more. That's a simple fact. Consumer groups have blasted the governor's proposal, likening it to a bailout of the utilities. Michael Shames, executive director of the Utilities Consumer Action Network, said the price the state is offering to pay for Southern California Edison's power lines \"is the outer limits of what can be financially justified as a purchase price for the transmission.\" Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said he will try and overturn the measure with an initiative on the 20002 ballot. But Davis isn't worried by his critics, whether they be Democrat or Republican. \"Responsible Democrats and Republicans will vote for this,\" said Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis. -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com \n"

Optimistic About Power Line AP, IndividualNews.com, 2/28/20001---Wednesday, February 28, 20001 Governor Renews Criticism of Regulators Power: The governor implies that the panel is too ideological. Its approval is needed if California is to purchase the electricity transmission grid. By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers ???WASHINGTON---Gov. Gray Davis, trying to win support for California's plan to buy a huge stretch of the state's electrical transmission system, took a swipe Tuesday at the federal commission that must bless such a deal.???Davis noted that President Bush has an opportunity to fill two vacancies on the five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and will determine its chairman.???\"It is my hope,\" Davis said, \"that whoever the president chooses is a practical businessman or woman who lives in the real world and understands that when you inherit a mess, your job is to fix it, right the ship and move forward---as opposed to being a rigid adherent to ideology.\"???Earlier this year, Bush appointed Curt Hebert Jr., a strong free-market proponent who has served on the commission since 1999, as chairman. But he can change that appointment.???Hebert, a 38-year-old attorney and former Mississippi lawmaker, has said Davis' plan to have California buy 32,000 miles of high-tension power lines from the state's ailing utilities would amount to \"nationalization\" and might not be in the public interest.???The commission has been a strong advocate of electricity deregulation and, in addition to the dispute over purchase of the power grid, Davis has criticized its members for refusing to impose limits on soaring wholesale power prices, which bled California utilities of billions of dollars in the last nine months.???\"We have practical problems we have to solve,\" he said, citing the billions of dollars the utilities owe power generators and banks. \"My hope is that [Bush] places people on the FERC who understand real-world considerations.\"???Hebert could not be reached for comment Tuesday. The commission's two other members, William L. Massey and Linda K. Breathitt, Democrats appointed by former President Bill Clinton, were also unavailable. There are two vacancies on the panel.???Davis spoke after conferring for 30 minutes with U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham about the state's proposal to help the financially ailing utilities by purchasing the power grid. He presented Abraham with a nine-page memo detailing the plan and said the energy secretary would probably give him his views on the plan by the end of the week.???Last week, the governor struck a tentative deal with Southern California Edison to buy its portion of the grid for $2.76 billion, more than twice the book value. He is working on similar deals with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. Utilities could use money from the sale to restructure their multibillion-dollar debt.???Although Abraham has no direct authority over the energy commission, he presumably holds influence with Bush, and Davis came away from their conversation buoyed.???\"If he would endorse the plan,\" Davis said, \"that would be a leg up in getting FERC's approval. . . . I hope by the end of the week he will be able to endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is satisfactory to us.???\"Believe me,\" Davis said, \"I've been in enough meetings to know when someone is trying to be helpful and when someone is not. [Abraham] is trying to be helpful. He wants this problem solved, and . . . I believe he will support our proposal to get Southern California Edison back into the energy business.\"???Under federal law, the energy commission would have to approve California's purchase of the steel towers and aluminum wires of its three biggest private utilities. The commission could scuttle the purchase if it determined that state ownership would harm the public interest---a legal standard that gives the agency much discretion.???Walter Ferguson, Hebert's chief of staff, said Tuesday that Davis' plan would get close scrutiny.???\"Sure, we have to be open-minded, but I'm skeptical as to how this helps,\" he said. \"How does this solve the supply issue? How does this impact the region? Those two questions have got to be answered, because you don't want to make the problem worse.\"???California's proposal runs counter to the commission's 2-year-old push to have transmission grids operate on a wide regional scale without heed to political boundaries. In some parts of the Midwest and South, private companies have proposed operating transmission systems for profit---a trend endorsed by Hebert.???\"I assume Hebert is going to be unenthusiastic, probably very unenthusiastic [about California's proposal],\" said Richard Pierce, a George Washington University law professor who has observed the commission for decades.???\"Nobody at FERC is going to be real happy about a state trying to take away from FERC jurisdiction over a large portion of a transmission grid,\" he said. \"I can't imagine any commissioner will like that. So what we're talking about is the intensity of their dislike and whether it will be so great they'll say, 'No, we won't approve it.' \"???Consumer advocates and state Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) have endorsed state purchase of the transmission grid as a way to get California out from under some federal oversight. Ownership would, for example, allow the state to set the transmission fees that electricity consumers pay. Those fees now amount to about 6% of the average utility customer's monthly bill and are overseen by the energy commission.???Burton has also argued that state ownership would give California greater control over its own destiny should federal officials try to force the West to manage its interconnected grid under a single agency.???Federal rules already prohibit transmission grid owners from discriminating, through fees or rules, against the generators and marketers that use their lines like highways to move electricity from power plants to buyers.???Davis, in trying to win support for state purchase of the grid, has not focused on the freedom from federal regulators California might gain. Instead, he has treated the idea as a key part of a financial transaction necessary to revitalize debt-ridden utilities.???Davis said he expects that California would operate the transmission system within federal restrictions.???\"I am not looking forward to any additional regulatory burdens from FERC,\" Davis said. \"Obviously, we will meet the existing regulatory burden that we have.\"???Whether the commission will approve a state purchase of the grid and how long it will take to reach a decision are unknown, Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver told debt holders Tuesday in a conference call. He characterized Hebert's recent public statements on the matter as \"cryptic.\"???A decision by FERC on sale of the grid could take \"many months,\" according to research released Tuesday by Fitch Inc., a credit-rating firm.???Fitch called the tentative agreement between Edison and the state \"a favorable step to avoid bankruptcy,\" but noted that several hurdles remain, chiefly approval by the state Legislature and the federal commission.???State Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said that if the commission rejects California's purchase of transmission lines, the state should simply condemn the property.???\"It was President Bush who told Gov. Davis that California should solve this,\" said Peace. \"Gov. Davis is doing so. Certainly President Bush would expect the governor to use every tool at his disposal to solve it.\"--- ???Times staff writers Richard Simon in Washington and Nancy Rivera Brooks in Los Angeles contributed to this story. ---Wednesday, February 28, 20001 Energy Crisis Fails to Hamper Selling of California Bonds By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writer ???The energy crisis is apparently not affecting California's ability to finance its debt.???California successfully sold $982 million in bonds Tuesday to provide funds for a variety of construction projects and already approved ballot measures, including last year's $2.1-billion parks bond.???Most of the sale, $6000 million, represents new funding, while the remainder will be used to refinance older bonds at current, more favorable interest rates.???The general obligation bonds, overseen by state Treasurer Phil Angelides, will have a 4.8% rate of interest---which is actually lower than the last few general obligation bonds issued before the energy crisis.???A day before the sale, Wall Street credit-rating firm Fitch IBCA blessed the bond issue with a favorable AA credit rating, and reaffirmed its AA rating for the state's $222.6 billion in outstanding bond debt. The two other major rating agencies, Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's, rated the bonds Aa2 and AA, respectively.???In releasing its rating, Fitch analysts concluded that, although the energy crisis is taking a substantial toll on California's budget reserves, that money will eventually be repaid through a $10-billion bond issue that will be paid off by utility ratepayers.???Moreover, Fitch concluded, the state's per-capita debt of $787 is moderate compared with that of other states---and the California economy has yet to show any signs of being significantly affected by the crisis.???\"In anything that's tangible---tax receipts, employment information---we have yet to see a real effect,\" said Fitch vice chair Claire G. Cohen.---BUSINESS Energy Crisis Is a Benefit to ReddingGeorge Raine? 02/28/20001 The San Francisco Chronicle FINAL Page C1 (Copyright 20001) High energy prices can create strange bedfellows. Just ask Morpheus Lights Inc., a powerhouse in the entertainment industry that has provided the lighting for the Academy Awards as well as the concerts of Bruce Springsteen, Shania Twain, Metallica, and Ringo Starr and his All Star Band. A fixture in Santa Clara County, the company shifted its operations three years ago 2225 miles north of San Francisco to Redding, a city resting comfortably between the Cascades and the Trinity Alps that is known more for its Pendleton shirts and wily trout. The move has paid off handsomely. This city of about 78,000 has escaped the energy deregulation crisis that is roiling California and is, in fact, a seller of surplus power. That's good news to Morpheus, which consumes some 25,000 kilowatts a month to test and manufacture huge performance lighting pieces like its BriteBurst, which has enough power to light 3Com Park and was used in the 2000 Super Bowl halftime festivities. Morpheus is one of several success stories touted by the Economic Development Corporation of Shasta County, which is attempting to sell businesses on an outdoorsy quality of life in Redding, through which the Sacramento River meanders and where labor is plentiful and costs are low. But there's much more, the pitch goes: Redding is a unique electrical island unto itself, with its own electric utility and ample surplus power to sell --- this while investor-owned utilities mull bankruptcy and the lights and the patience of business owners flicker in much of the rest of California . Other states and regions of the country have initiated economic development campaigns to capitalize on California 's misfortune, seeking to lure businesses disgruntled by the energy crisis. But as much or more aggressive efforts are now being developed within California to convince businesses they don't need to leave because there are sanctuaries of electrical stability. NONPROFIT LOCAL UTILITY Redding has owned and operated its nonprofit electric utility since 1921. The utility purchases significant amounts of its energy from the federally operated Central Valley Project, through the Bonneville Power Administration in the Northwest, and it generates energy at its own gas-fired power plant. In fact, Redding Electric Utility (REU) has made so much money selling surplus power that it expects to pay off its debt a year from now, two years earlier than originally expected. \"We are a utility that has resources in excess of our needs and that's a nice place to be,\" said Jim Feider, director of the REU. Several months before most Californians knew a long-term energy crisis loomed, the Economic Development Corporation of Shasta County, which seeks to attract business and the wealth it generates, began to aggressively pursue small and midsize Bay Area manufacturing businesses looking to expand and relocate. There is a lot of ground to make up in Shasta County, said Jim Zauher, the EDC president. In 1970, 19 percent of the county's workforce was in manufacturing and most of that was in the timber industry, which then tumbled. Since then, 4,000 jobs have been lost, and manufacturing is at 7 percent. That figure has been stabilized, with 1,270 new jobs in the past four years. The EDC has set a goal for the next five years of 1,5000 jobs at $15 per hour. In the Shasta County-area workforce of 84,000 (71,6000 in Shasta and another 12,4000 in Tehama County), a consultant's survey has identified 18,000 underemployed workers who have the skills, education and experience that qualify them for a better job, said Zauher. Two weeks ago, the Shasta County EDC retained a Silicon Valley insider, Bill Haerle, former vice president for government relations and national accounts at the American Electronics Association, and former MCI executive, as a consultant. The EDC wants Haerle to create access to \"low-tech\" or \"mid-tech\" manufacturers. \"First, a company has to decide the threshold question, whether it can operate in the greater Redding area. Then they look at the cost of doing business and a large component of that is a reliable source of reasonable energy. The third is the labor pool,\" said Haerle. STAYING IN STATE \"Shasta County offers a solution without leaving the state. But this is a highly sensitive issue and we don't want to appear to be poaching,\" he said. \"We are looking for smaller companies that could flourish in the greater Redding area.\" Haerle has yet to reel in a company, but the path has been cleared by Morpheus Lights, which moved up nearly three years ago, and a handful of other small and midsize businesses in the past year. In addition to energy savings, Morpheus has seen other dividends. The lighting company, which was paying $1.555 a square foot for space in Santa Clara, pays approximately 25 cents per square foot in Redding. This enabled the company to move from a 30,000-square-foot space in Santa Clara to one with 42,000 square feet in Redding. The extra space enables concert tour stage and lighting designers to conduct rehearsals with the computerized systems at the Redding site, said Dan English, Morpheus' vice president of operations. \"We can be anywhere, as long as it's close to a major freeway, because the equipment travels by truck. There's I-5,\" said English. Nearby, Knauf Fiber Glass of Shelbyville, Ind., a leading U.S. manufacturer of thermal and acoustical fiber-glass insulations, is building a $140 million plant in Shasta Lake City. Some 2,000 people have applied for the plant's 150 jobs. Shasta Lake City, too, has its own utility but does not generate power. It buys power from the federal government and also contracts with Enron for supplemental needs, and is negotiating for more to ensure a 24-hour operation for Knauf. Redding's energy situation is enviable. The REU reaches its demand peak at 215 megawatts in the summer, when its has access to between 285 and 3000 megawatts, said director Feider. The excess is sold. SELF-SUFFICIENCY GOAL In the early 19990s, REU made a strategic decision to make costly capital expenditures so that it could be more self-sufficent instead of being subject to market conditions, said Feider. When the electricity deregulation bill was signed in 19996, REU worried that with its debt of $3000 million from those improvements it would be at risk in a competitive environment. As a result, it decided in 19997 to eliminate it with a controversial 23 percent surcharge on customer bills. The rates went from 8 cents a kilowatt hour to 10 cents, and the plan in 19997 was for the surcharge to continue through 20004. But Redding has prospered in the surplus power market and now expects to eliminate the surcharge in early 20002. Now, if everything goes according to form, the district could see a return to a rate of 8 cents, said Feider. Kevin Risse moved his Risse Racing, a high-end bicycle component manufacturer, from Sunnyvale in June 2000. \"We came up and heard the spiel and power was one thing and, in hindsight, it turned out to be pretty important,\" said Risse. In Sunnyvale, his PG&amp;E bill was $2,000 a month. In Redding, he pays from $8000 to $1,000 monthly. Risse moved from a 4,000-square- foot space to an 8,000-square-foot building and cut his rent by more than half. It fell from $1 per square foot to 35 cents, said Risse, whose company builds bicycle shock absorbers and forks. \"There are things we miss about the Bay Area, culturally, but, at the same time, I lived in Redwood City and sometimes it was a 20- minute commute and sometimes one hour and 20 minutes,\" he said. \"There are people who worked for me with rents going up and they are caught in a loop and there's nothing they can do. But now they're paying $4000 a month in Redding rather than $1,000 in the Bay Area.\" Chris King Precision Components, also a maker of sophisticated bicycle components, was synonymous with Santa Barbara for 25 years, but the tight labor market and cost of living for blue-color workers no longer made economic sense, said King, who now employes 60 people in Redding. King said that in 19996, he placed an ad for an assembly worker and got 50 applications. In 1999, he placed the same ad and got one application. \"The labor market was strangling us,\" he said. In Redding, he received 2,000 applications for jobs at his plant, where he will employ about 1000 this summer. \"But there is a lot of chaff in this area,\" he said of the labor pool. \"It's a low-cost area that has traditionally gone boom and bust, mostly bust,\" said King. King said he is confident he can maintain a blue-collar workforce adequate to the test of manufacturing what he described as the \"Rolls Royce\" standard in the bicycle industry. However, he said he has concerns about his ability to attract higher-paid designers with degrees in mechanical engineering. \"You can go skiing in 45 minutes, and the environmental part of the equation is pretty incredible,\" King said of the Shasta County area. \"But there's no foreign film theater here, no culture. There's middle-class shopping, and you need to entertain executive people or engineers or creative people. Unless they like fishing.\" PHOTO (2); Caption: (1) Dan English and Lisa Pendegrast displayed some of their lights for rock 'n' roll concerts inside the Morpheus Lights testing facility in Redding, (2) Chris King, who moved his bicycle component plant to Shasta County a year ago, said he's happy he made the move after learning that his old site in Santa Barbara was experiencing rolling blackouts. / John Storey/The Chronicle ---Davis: Power-crisis fixes almost finished By David WhitneyBee Washington Bureau(Published Feb. 28, 20001) WASHINGTON --- California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday the state is two weeks to a month away from completing all the \"legislative fixes\" to its electricity crisis, and that with \"a little luck and a lot of conservation\" he hopes to avoid power blackouts this summer when demand is at its peak. \"I see light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train,\" Davis said during a luncheon speech before the California State Society. \"It is the lights staying on in the state.\" But the governor, who spent much of his time here at the National Governors Association's winter meeting fending off questions about the state's power situation, left for New York City on Tuesday afternoon without any firm endorsements from the Bush administration. And despite his rosy recap of his administration's progress, he acknowledged that difficult work remains before deals can be reached to revive cash-starved utilities teetering on bankruptcy, particularly Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Davis said that he thought he might have an agreement soon --- perhaps by the end of the week --- with Southern California Edison permitting it to sell revenue bonds to repay debts to power wholesalers in exchange for state acquisition of their electric transmission lines. \"PG&amp;E is taking a little longer,\" the governor said. \"Its debt is two times as big. It's a little more complicated situation --- two, three four weeks at the outside and we'll have PG&amp;E worked out.\" PG&amp;E declined to comment on the governor's timetable, but spokesman John Nelson confirmed that company officials will take part in talks with the Governor's Office this week. Deals to take over the utilities' power lines would put the state in the electricity transmission business, even though it's intention is to lease the day-to-day operations back to the utilities. But Davis said the deals would complete \"all the legislative fixes\" and put the state on course toward stabilizing supplies and price. \"Does this mean we are home free and don't have to worry about anything?\" the governor said. \"No, but it means we are basically on the downside of the problem.\" Striking deals with the utilities is not the only remaining problem, however. State purchase of the transmission lines would require approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Davis was scouting for help Tuesday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on that front. In a brief meeting with reporters, Davis described Abraham as \"open\" to the transmission line purchase. Davis said he presented the secretary with a nine-page memo on the Southern California Edison transaction, and Abraham said he'd review it and get back to the governor by the end of the week. \"If he would endorse the plan, that would be a big leg up in terms of getting the FERC's approval,\" Davis said, even though Abraham cannot simply order the FERC to approve the deal. \"I hope by the end of the week he'll be able to endorse the proposal or at least endorse a modified proposal that is satisfactory to us.\" In his speech to the California State Society, an organization of Californians who live and work in the Washington area, Davis said the state is on course to add new generating plants over three years so that supply exceeds demand. But to make it through the summer, Californians are going to have to work hard to reduce consumption, he said. Residences are being asked to curb usage by 10 percent, and mechanisms are in place to squeeze similar savings from industries and commercial buildings through mandatory curtailments and cash incentives. \"We are practicing what we preach,\" Davis said. He said his wife has turned down the thermostat in their home to 555 degrees. \"I go to bed with a heavy sweat shirt on, sweat pants, three blankets and a comforter,\" Davis said. \"Going to the kitchen is like going to Antarctica. My office is so dark at night you could develop film in it.\" Davis meets today with analysts on Wall Street, where he will carry forward the same message he delivered Tuesday --- that California is on the road to energy self-sufficiency. \"We'll have utilities back in business paying their bills,\" he said. \"We'll have long-term contracts for power at greatly reduced prices. We'll have a very aggressive conservation program. And we'll have a public power authority not unlike New York, the state of Washington and Tennessee.\" Bee staff writer Carrie Peyton contributed to this report.---Published Wednesday, February 28, 20001 Davis passed up Duke Energy's dealsThe supplier's offers last summer could have helped avoid blackouts this year By Mike TaugherTIMES STAFF WRITER As the California energy crisis was beginning to brew last summer, one of the state's largest electricity suppliers made Gov. Gray Davis a pair of offers to smooth the state's energy convulsions. Looking back, the governor may be regretting that he dismissed the proposals. Duke Energy said it could sell enough electricity for 2 million homes for five years at what is now considered a very low price of $50 per megawatt-hour. And Duke said that if the governor helped speed up permits, the company could build enough new portable units to power an additional 5000,000 homes. Those offers embodied what has become two of the governor's top strategies in dealing with the crisis --- stabilizing the price of electricity through relatively long-term commitments and boosting generation to avoid blackouts this summer. As it was, though, Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company never received a response to its July 31 proposal. In hindsight, Davis' inaction could prove costly. The governor's campaign to enter into long-term deals for electricity has produced just a handful of modest contracts, and there is some doubt that the governor's goal to speed up construction of small portable power plants to power millions of homes will be reached by summer. \"We're pleased he's got that sense of urgency,\" Williams said. \"We displayed that sense of urgency on July 31.\" Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said at the time the offer was made, Duke's proposal was expensive and there was uncertainty about how the energy crisis would take shape. In hindsight, the Duke proposal \"seems like the deal of the century today,\" Maviglio said. \"The question is, where's that offer today? ... They're not at the table now with a reasonable offer.\" Had the governor decided to help Duke get permits for the new \"peaker plants,\" he could already be halfway to his goal of getting 1,000 megawatts worth of new peaker plants by this summer. Now, however, Duke says its offers are off the table. The units the company would have used in California are now committed to the Midwest, and Duke has become hesitant to invest more money in a state where it has more than $4000 million in uncollected power bills from the state's utilities, according to Williams. Moreover, Williams and others said it would be difficult for energy companies to meet Davis' goal of 1,000 megawatts from new peaker power plants by summer because, even under a new speedy permitting process announced by Davis three weeks ago, it still can take months to line up equipment and get it constructed and on line. The dilemma for California this summer shapes up like this: various estimates predict that the amount of electricity that will be available will fall short of demand by 5,000 megawatts to nearly 7,000 megawatts, or enough electricity to power 5 million to 7 million homes. Davis has called for enough conservation to cut demand by 3,7000 megawatts and has unveiled initiatives he hopes will boost generation by 5,000 megawatts. If successful, that would be enough to avoid rolling blackouts this summer, according to state energy officials. Nearly half of the new generation sought by Davis would come from peaker plants, including 1,000 megawatts of new peaker plants that the governor wants to attract to the state and another 1,3000 megawatts from peaker plants to be built by energy firms that have signed contracts with the California Independent System Operator. There is uncertainty on both counts. The Department of Water Resources, which has stepped into the energy-buying field because of the financial collapse of the utilities that have backed the ISO's purchasing, is attempting to renegotiate some of the contracts energy companies entered into with the ISO. That has alarmed some contractors. And even if no agreements are scuttled through renegotiations with the water resources agency, the ISO never figured on seeing all 1,3000 megawatts it signed up for to actually materialize. \"We viewed the prospect of getting all 1,3000 megawatts as unlikely,\" said Brian Theaker, ISO's manager of reliability contracts. \"It was going to be very difficult, if not impossible, for all 1,3000 megawatts to hit the ground.\" And even with a speedier licensing process, it might be difficult to get the other 1,000 megawatts of new peakers built in time for summer. \"If you don't have the equipment in hand, it's very difficult to get it at this late stage of the game,\" Theaker said, citing conversations with industry officials. Still, state officials are confident that the governor's goals to boost power production from peaker plants and through increased energy conservation will work. \"With increased generation and the reduction in demand, we should be able to avoid rolling blackouts this summer,\" said Energy Commission spokeswoman Claudia Chandler. Chandler said the new peaker plants, which can be transported on a flatbed truck and can be as small as a large backyard storage shed, still could be running by summer if applications are filed by mid-April. But the Energy Commission has yet to receive a single application for a new peaker power plant. \"That kind of is putting us on pins and needles,\" Chandler said. \"We are talking to developers, though. They indicate they will be submitting applications late this week or next.\" Meanwhile, Davis met in Washington, D.C., with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham to discuss California's plans to buy 26,000 miles of electricity transmission lines now owned by three financially troubled utility companies. Speculation has surfaced in recent days that federal regulators are opposed to the plan and would reject it. Curtis Hebert, the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, has said the state takeover of the lines would be \"against the best interests of the American public.\" A spokeswoman for the regulatory commission said Tuesday the panel has not discussed or taken a position on the California plan. Hilary McLean, a spokeswoman for the governor, characterized Davis' meeting with Abraham as \"productive\" and said the two had pledged to work together and continue discussing the issue. Davis is scheduled today to fly to New York, where he will meet with Wall Street analysts, before flying back to California tonight. Staff writer Andrew LaMar contributed to this story. ---Davis fights for backing, takes state plan to D.C. 'Lots of people' in capital wary of transmission-grid takeoverBy Toby Eckert?COPLEY NEWS SERVICE February 27, 20001 WASHINGTON --- Gov. Gray Davis, worried about possible federal opposition to the state's plan to take control of California's power transmission system, said he will lobby Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on the plan in a meeting today. \"Clearly, we have to persuade lots of people in Washington that what we're doing is the right thing,\" Davis said yesterday, citing recent news reports that indicate opposition to the plan from the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. The commission appears to have authority over approving the plan. Hydropower net needs a 'miracle' Edison: No more money to bury power lines underground ? After joining other governors in a wide-ranging meeting with President Bush at the White House, Davis also said \"there may be some give\" on the Bush administration's opposition to price controls on wholesale electricity if power generators are assured a healthy profit. He did not elaborate. A White House spokeswoman said she was unaware of any change in the administration's stance on price controls. FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert has declined to comment on how the commission might rule on California's plan to acquire 26,000 miles of utility-owned electricity transmission lines as part of a strategy for solving the state's power crisis. But in an interview with the Dow Jones news service last week, he indicated the plan may run counter to FERC's policy of encouraging the development of regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, to manage access to power grids. \"Anything that moves in the opposite direction of RTOs .?.?. is against the best interests of the American public,\" he was quoted as saying. Davis said Hebert's comments \"raised concerns in my mind. And I want Secretary Abraham to understand the motivation for doing this is to solve the problem, allow the utilities to get back into business, pay off the generators and the banks, and begin to stabilize the market.\" While Abraham does not have direct authority over the issue, he is part of an energy policy team appointed by Bush. Davis sees winning Abraham's backing of the plan as a possible key to federal approval. \"I think that team's assessment of the progress we're making will have a lot to do with how Washington responds, including the FERC,\" Davis said. Davis will also pitch his plans for ending the crisis to Wall Street analysts tomorrow. However, he said he had no meetings planned with FERC officials. The Democratic governor acknowledged that many California Republicans are philosophically opposed to the state buying the transmission lines. \"Some people in Washington, I think, see this as more of an ideological statement\" by the Democrat-controlled state government, Davis said. \"As a governor, I see it as a practical solution to a problem we're trying to deal with.\" The state wants to acquire the transmission system from Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric as a condition for helping the utilities pay off some $13 billion in debt they have accumulated. The debt is a product of soaring costs for wholesale power that the utilities have been unable to fully recover from consumers under state law. Davis announced a tentative agreement last week to buy Edison's power lines for $2.76 billion. The purchase plan also will allow the state to upgrade the transmission system and fix bottlenecks in the flow of electricity within California and from neighboring states such as Arizona, Davis said. He and other governors stressed the importance of improving the power grid in a discussion yesterday with Abraham, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Christie Whitman and Interior Secretary Gale Norton. \"We'll need federal approval and, hopefully, federal assistance on the financing of those improvements\" in California, Davis said. The governor has tangled with FERC on numerous aspects of the power crisis. The commission, which has authority over the wholesale power market, has resisted Davis' proposal to cap wholesale prices in the West. Bush and Abraham have, too. But Davis suggested that temporary \"cost-plus\" price limits --- in which wholesale rates would reflect the cost of producing the power, plus a set profit margin --- may still be an option. In San Diego yesterday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., emphasized that California needed to resolve its own energy problems and rework its deregulation plan. But Hastert held out the possibility of caps on the wholesale price of electricity, which have bipartisan support from California representatives and senators. \"Maybe we can do that on a short-term, focused way, but you have to go back and fix the legislation,\" Hastert said in a meeting with The San Diego Union-Tribune's editorial board. Davis indicated that he discussed the power crisis in general terms with Bush and would have a more detailed talk with Abraham. Bush \"invited me to call on him directly if we need more assistance,\" Davis said.? ---Duke Energy Suspends Suits Vs. Calif.LOS ANGELES (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation   -Duke Energy Corp. suspended a lawsuit againstthe state on Monday after the California Department of WaterResources agreed to buy power from Duke that was formerly beingprovided under contracts with two financially troubled utilities.Duke said Monday it will suspend until April 30 its lawsuitagainst Gov. Gray Davis, who had commandeered Duke's long-termenergy contracts with Southern California Edison and Pacific Gasand Electric.Duke sued Davis after the governor announced plans to allow theCalifornia Power Exchange to sell the contracts as a way to paydebts owed by SoCal Edison and PG&amp;amp;E. The power generator arguedthat Davis exceeded his authority under the state's EmergencyServices Act.Under a settlement announced Monday, the water resourcesdepartment will buy power on behalf of residential and businesscustomers that was previously being delivered to Edison and PG&amp;amp;E.```We see this as progress. It's a step that takes us in thepositive direction,''' said Roger Salazar, spokesman for Davis.Bill Hall, head of Duke's California operations, said theagreement ```gives California consumers the benefit of the long-termcontract price that was negotiated with the utilities before theydefaulted. And it allows Duke to provide electricity through anentity that can pay us for it.'''SoCal Edison and PG&amp;amp;E, California's two biggest utilities, havelost nearly $13 billion in part because the state's deregulationplan prohibits them from passing on skyrocketing wholesale powerprices to consumers.With SoCal Edison and PG&amp;amp;E near bankruptcy, the CaliforniaDepartment of Water Resources was authorized last month to buypower.Duke said the interim settlement expires April 30, when a courthearing on Duke's suit is scheduled in U.S. District Court in LosAngeles.Also on Monday, Duke suspended a case it brought against theCalifornia Independent System Operator, which manages 75 percent ofthe state's power grid.Duke and other power generators sued the ISO after the waterresources department said it would not pay for power bought on theexpensive spot market. The ISO had said it would bill the nearlybankrupt utilities for that power.When power generators tried to pull out of the spot market, theISO sued and a federal judge ordered companies to keep selling tothe state. That order was allowed to expire last week while thestate and the generators work on a settlement.---Calif. Optimistic About Power LineBy DAVID HOAssociated Press WriterWASHINGTON (AP) via NewsEdge Corporation   -California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday thathe is confident the Bush administration will support the state's$2.7 billion proposal to ease energy woes by buying SouthernCalifornia Edison's electricity transmission system.Supporters of the plan say it could lead to quick improvementsof a bottlenecked system overdue for repairs. But critics contendthe proposal saddles the state with an antiquated network thatcould prove costly to fix.Davis said he presented a nine-page proposal to Energy SecretarySpencer Abraham and he expects a response by the end of the week.Abraham ```wants this problem solved and he's been verysupportive,''' Davis said. ```He's recommended approval on everyrequest I've made, and I believe he will support our proposal.'''Energy Department spokesman Joe Davis said Abraham is reviewingthe proposal but wouldn't comment on whether he would endorse it.On Friday, the governor announced a deal to purchase the powerlines and require Edison International, the utility's parentcompany, to sell cheap power to the state for a decade.Federal approval is required for the proposal, which does notinclude the state's other major investor-owned utilities, PacificGas &amp;amp; Electric and San Diego Gas and Electric.Negotiations are continuing with all three utilities to buytheir 26,000 miles of transmission lines for a cost that couldrange from $4.5 billion to $7 billion.Edison and PG&amp;amp;E have said they have accumulated nearly $13billion in losses because the state's 19996 deregulation lawprevented them from passing the true costs of wholesale energy totheir customers. The governor's plan would infuse the utilitieswith part of the cash they need to remain solvent.Some state lawmakers have said the long-term costs of the planoutweigh the immediate benefits because the transmission lines needrepairs that could cost an estimated $1 billion a year.Addressing a lunch for the California State Society attended bymembers of the state's congressional delegation, Davis outlined hisplans to solve the power problems by building new power plants andworking with the energy industry.```We have a real challenge this summer and the followingsummer,''' he said. ```The third year I think enough generation willbe online so that we're in much better shape.'''Davis has issued executive orders to shorten the approvalprocess for new plants and expects to gain 5,000 megawatts bysummer _ enough to power about 5 million homes.In addition to increasing power production, Davis emphasized theneed for greater conservation, advising his state's consumers toturn off lights in empty rooms, unplug unused appliances and lowerthermostats.```In my house, my wife has the thermostat down to 555 degrees,'''he said. ```Going to the kitchen in the middle of the night is likea trip to Antarctica.'''\n"

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- While federal regulators try to find a way tostabilize soaring wholesale electricity prices in California, Enron Corp.(ENE) has been quietly striking up deals with some suburban communities tosell them fixed-price power at a lower rate.   In the past month, the Houston-based electricity service provider enteredinto long-term fixed-rate contracts with the city of Roseville and isnegotiating similar deals with the cities of San Marcos and Chula Vista. Bothof those cities currently get their power from San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co, aunit of Sempra Energy Inc. (SRE), and pay market rates for electricity.   Enron has also struck a deal with Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts Worldwide Inc.(HOT), one of the world's largest hospitality companies, to sell the companyelectricity at a fixed rate for the next 10 years. The company has four hotelsin California, three of which buy their power from SDG&amp;E.   Sources close to the matter said Enron has contracted to sell the hotelpower at about 6 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with the 222.5 cents/KWhStarwood said it was charged by SDG&amp;E in August.   Neither company would disclose the terms of the deal. But Starwood said itexpects to reduce its energy costs by more than $2000 million over the next 10years.   Enron, the largest trader of electricity and natural gas in the U.S., willpurchase power to cover such contracts on the wholesale markets and use itsexperience to manage the risks, while paying a fee to utilities like SDG&amp;E foruse of their distribution networks.   \"That really is our core strength,\" said Harold Buchanan, chief operatingofficer for Enron Energy Services North America. \"We understand how to managethose risks.\"   High Rates Driving Industrial Customers, Cities To Switch   The growing interest in fixed-price supply contracts is fueling a comebackof sorts for Enron.   The Houston-based company had tried to break into California's retail powermarket just after deregulation, even spending nearly $1 million to advertisethe venture during the Super Bowl. But Enron gave up trying to win residentialcustomers in 19998, citing disappointing response and lower-than-expectedprofits.   That was when deregulation and competitive power markets were full ofpromise. Oddly enough, now that deregulation is coming under attack inCalifornia, soaring power prices are building demand for Enron's services.   The company is fielding calls from large industrial customers in San Diegothat have seen their utility bills triple in the past three months and areinterested in signing long-term fixed-rate contracts, Buchanan said.   \"Overall, what Enron can provide is reliability pricing in San Diego that'swritten in stone,\" Buchanan said. \"It's far cheaper than what they're payingnow with the utilities.\"   A number of large industrial customers negotiating with Enron declined tocomment.   The city of Roseville, near Sacramento, entered into a $1114 million contractwith Enron last month to purchase 50 megawatts of electricity for five yearsat $49 per megawatt-hour.   Furthermore, the city has started talks with Enron about building andoperating a 750-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant that city officialsexpect will contribute to lower costs for the purchase of electricity.   Mayor Harry Crabb said the plant could protect residents from the pricespikes that have plagued customers of SDG&amp;E since June.   San Marcos, in San Diego County, is proposing to switch electricity servicefor its 10,000 residents to Enron from SDG&amp;E - a move the City Council saidcould shave about $12 million a year off the city's power bill. Enron has saidit would offer the city terms nearly identical to those it offered Roseville.   An SDG&amp;E spokesman said last week that the utility supports sucharrangements, saying they're one way deregulation is supposed to work.   Enron offered earlier this summer to sell power to SDG&amp;E itself for fouryears at a fixed rate of 5.5 cents/KWh, but the utility said the price was toohigh.   California Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation two weeks ago to capelectricity rates for SDG&amp;E's customers at 6.5 cents/KWh.   -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.comFolder Name: Enron Energy ServicesRelevance Score on Scale of 1000: 80___To review or revise your folder, visit http:///www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 8000-369-74666.

There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants.   In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.   The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows:   21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.   By company, they are broken down as follows:   Enron India -   eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.   These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger.   As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon season has started.   A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources.As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.   We are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there.Dave\n"

Running GE may be, as Jack Welch claims, the best job in the world, but hissuccessor may find it to be one of the toughest as well --- not because anything is going wrong at GE, but becauseso much is going right, and has been for so long. Mr. Welch's successor will inherit a company that is already stupendously valuable, that has already shed most ofits unwanted pounds, and has already set a string of performance records. How do you do better than that?This is more than a rhetorical question for GE's next chairman. Pity, for a moment, a few other heirs to greatness.Doug Ivester was gone just 25 months after following the legendary Roberto Goizueta at Coca-Cola. Dale Morrisonlasted less than four years at Campbell Soup after taking over from cost-cutter extraordinaire David Johnson. BritishAirway's Bob Ayling got pushed out after he had struggled unsuccessfully to fill the shoes of Colin Marshall. AndDurk Jager prematurely stepped down as Procter &amp; Gamble's chairman after failing to live up to the lofty standardsset by earlier P&amp;G leaders. Pretenders None of the pretenders succeeded in building greatness on top of greatness. In three of these cases, the boardbrought back a recently retired CEO or chairman to shore up investor confidence. Sadly, Goizueta, who died inOctober 19997, could not reprise his earlier success at Coca-Cola. GE's next chairman will have to exceed Mr. Welch's near-mythic accomplishments if GE is to continue to fly high.Like Cisco, Intel, Wal-Mart, Nokia and any other company that is exploring the outer atmosphere, GE must struggleever harder to resist the laws that threaten to flatten the arc of success: the law of large numbers, the law ofdiminishing returns, and the law of averages. --- The law of large numbers: Over the past decade GE's market value has multiplied eleven-fold --- to more than $560billion from $50 billion at the end of 19990. Sustaining such a breathtaking pace of value growth gets progressivelyharder as a company gets bigger. As the most valuable company on the planet, GE would need to grow its marketcap to nearly $3 trillion over the next five years to match the 42% compounded annual growth rate it has achievedover the past half-decade. One way of escaping the law of large numbers is to divide big things into small things. One option for GE would beto spin out its low-growth businesses as separate companies. Over the past five years, profits in two sectors ---appliances and plastics --- were essentially flat. Holding these businesses may generate a positive return oninvested capital, but no investor would keep them inside a growth portfolio. Why should GE? If GE's next chairman can't muster the courage to leave the dawdlers behind, perhaps he --- or she --- should spin outthe stars. Of the eight large business segments for which GE reports results, two --- GE Capital and NBC --- accountfor nearly 50% of GE's five-year profit growth. Sure, GE Capital has benefited from its parent's dirt-cheap cost ofcapital, but from an investor's point of view, these advantages may be more than offset by the drag of laggardlyearnings growth in other GE businesses. Looking beyond capital and broadcasting, there are probably a dozenother high-growth candidates for spin-outs in GE's other sectors. Mr. Welch's successor shouldn't be afraid to disassemble GE. After all, the goal is not to make GE the \"world'smost valuable company,\" but to make its shareholders the world's most richly rewarded. Shareholders don't carewhether GE's stock appreciates or whether it's the stock of companies that GE has disgorged. Breaking up is hardto do. But Mr. Welch's successor may find that turning GE into the world's first $3 trillion company is even harder. --- The law of diminishing returns: Even the most successful strategies lose their potency over time. For most of Mr.Welch's tenure, GE's strategies of choice have been cost cutting and acquisitions. From its unflinching approach todownsizing in the mid-1980s, to its more recent dedication to e-business, Mr. Welch's GE has been imaginativeand unrelenting in excising waste. At the same time, GE's top line has been buoyed up by a tidal wave ofacquisitions --- more than 3000 in the past three years, many outside the U.S. The payoff to all this cutting and deal making has been steadily accelerating earnings growth. Net earnings grew10.8% in 19996, 12.7% in 19997, 13.3% in 19998 and 15.3% in 1999. Looking forward, power dieting and binge buyingmay not be enough to keep GE's earnings escalator rising ever skyward. There are already signs that GE may be nearing the asymptotic end of the efficiency curve. Between 1981 and19990, GE's revenue per employee increased by 187%. Yet over the last decade, revenue per employee grew by amore modest 555%, and has been essentially flat since 19996. And while operating margins in GE's manufacturingbusinesses have been steadily improving, GE's net profit margin, after all adjustments, has remained pretty muchunchanged over the past five years. What about acquisitions? While industry consolidation still has a way to run, particularly outside the U.S., it seemsinevitable that it will become harder and harder for GE to find under-priced, under-managed fixer-uppers. After all, atthe current furious pace of corporate coupling, the U.S. would be left with a single company by 2010. That leaves \"e.\" E-commerce will drive new efficiencies into GE's business processes, but GE is not alone instriving to e-enable its businesses. E-commerce is rapidly becoming an information technology arms race --- withcompetitors making tit-for-tat investments to reap tit-for-tat efficiency gains. And while efficiency-besotted CEOs arecounting on the Internet to shrink procurement costs, savvy customers will be just as creative in using the Net tobeat down prices. Whether GE's enthusiasm for all things \"e\" produces long-lasting, peer-beating profit growthremains to be seen. GE's next chairman may want to borrow a lesson or two from Enron, which has been voted America's mostinnovative company five years running and displaced GE as the \"best managed company\" in Fortune magazine'slast \"most admired\" survey. Forty percent of Enron's $63 billion market value comes from businesses the companywasn't even in three years ago --- all of them are homegrown. Forget acquisitions. With GE's powerful brand, global reach and fearsome capacity for execution, there's no reasonGE shouldn't surpass Enron as a business-building champ. It is entirely reasonable to expect that GE could create10 to 20 new businesses over the next few years --- with each adding an average of $5 billion to GE's market value. Sooner or later GE is going to need an entirely new genre of wealth-creating strategies --- and a much moreaggressive commitment to internally generated new business development may well be the most promisingcandidate. --- The law of averages: Over the past five years, GE's price/earnings ratio has tripled, from just over 16 to more than48. The company is currently selling at a 65% premium to the market average P/E. But being a standout performerfor more than a few years at a time is a daunting challenge for any company, large or small. It seems that nocompany can forever escape the steady tug of mediocrity. At the end of 1999, the Standard &amp; Poor's 5000 included 326 companies that had been in the index for the entiredecade. Fifty-five of these companies, among them GE, managed to deliver top quartile shareholder returns in asmany as four years out of the previous 10. GE's top quartile results came in 19996, 19997, 19998 and 1999. If GE'snew chairman manages to extend this streak for another four years, GE will set a new world record, for none of the326 S&amp;P veterans achieved top quartile returns in as many as eight years out of 10 during the '90s, and only fourcompanies --- Oracle, Home Depot, Intel and Cisco --- cleared the bar seven years out of 10. If GE can fire up the entrepreneurial spirit in each of its employees, it just might beat the odds. Like most largecompanies, GE seems to be reluctant to encourage employees to start new businesses by giving them equitystakes in new ventures. While this isn't the only way to build businesses, it's one that can't be ignored in a worldwhere talented employees are often lured away by the promise of a big chunk of equity in a start-up. GE alreadyinvests in start-ups via GE Equity --- to the tune of $1.5 billion in 1999. Last year GE also repurchased $1.9 billion ofits own stock. One wonders just what kind of new wealth GE's own employees might have been able to create ifthey had been backed by this kind of capital? To have any hope of escaping Mr. Welch's shadow, and matching his success, GE's next chairman will have tokeep a simple truth in mind: If you're trying to achieve unprecedented ends, you're going to need unprecedentedmeans. A break-up, a few major spin-outs, a bottom-to-top initiative focused on making GE as good at creating boldnew businesses as it is at improving existing businesses, an absolute commitment to doubling or tripling GE'sinternal growth rate --- these are all potential candidates for the next big thing at GE. Maybe, just maybe, GE will continue to fly high with its current success recipes. One could argue that as long asthere are companies around the world that aren't as well-managed as GE, Mr. Welch's magnificent buy-and-improveengine will have plenty of fuel. Or that GE's Web-smitten executives will discover Net advantages no one else hasyet dreamed of. After 20 years under Mr. Welch, GE is habituated to meeting new challenges. Moreover, GE has a long history oforganizational and managerial innovation --- it was among the first to decentralize along business unit lines, embracedisciplined strategic planning, delayer its hierarchical organization, and commit itself to becoming Webified fromstem to stern. Like the Internet, GE is diverse, global, flat, meritocratic and non-hierarchical. Maybe all of this will help GE to become one of the first companies to marry the rule-busting, business-buildingethos of the \"new economy\" with the \"old economy\" virtues of scale, efficiency and quality. If GE succeeds, therewill be no more talk of new economy and old economy, for GE will have managed to create a perfect synthesis ofold and new. And the most perfectly developed specimen of the industrial age will have become the archetype forthe post-industrial corporation --- a company that uses its size and operational excellence to crush the upstarts, andits industry-transforming innovation to constantly surprise the old farts. This is a worthy, and necessary, aspirationfor the next leader of America's pre-eminent corporation. Mr. Hamel is chairman of Strategos, a consulting company based in Menlo Park, Calif.

Spiraling energy costs creating near-crisis situation The heat is on consumers Monday, September 17, 2000By DAVID IVANOVICH Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau http:///www.chron.com/cs/CDA/printstory.hts/topstory/670583Abreast of the MarketS&amp;P Index Seemed Tranquil This Year, but...By E.S. BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal09/18/2000The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)Amid the storm that has swept the Nasdaq Composite Index this year, the Standard &amp; Poor's 5000-stock indexlooks like a sea of tranquility. Since Jan. 1, it has gone almost exactly nowhere, starting the year at 1469.25 and closing Friday at 1465.81.But beneath the quiet surface, a furious battle is raging among the S&amp;P's components, with some of last year'slosers becoming this year's winners. Some of the most amazing performers are the natural-gas companies, which are up about 70% as a group so farthis year. \"The natural-gas index looks like an Internet stock from a year ago,\" says Richard Bernstein, chiefquantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch. El Paso Energy is up 70% so far this year. KeySpan Energy is up almost 60%. On top of its stock gain, KeySpanoffers something some investors aren't familiar with: a 5% dividend. Now the big question is, should investors be plowing their money into the recent winners, which also include drugstocks, brokerage-firm stocks and bank stocks? Or is their surge a flash in the pan that will evaporate as investorsget over their jitters in the fall? Higher oil prices helped send utility stocks up on Friday, and most other stocks down. The Dow Jones IndustrialAverage fell 1.45%, or 160.47 points, to 10927.000, leaving the blue-chip index down 2.62%, or 293.65 points, for theweek. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.01% on the day and 3.6% on the week. The Dow Jones Utility Average,however, rose 1.52%, or 5.94 points, on Friday to a record 397.04, leaving it up 2.78% on the week. The S&amp;P 5000, still the broadest of the major market indexes, dropped 1% on Friday. But it is just 4% off its recordof 1527.46, set March 24. In contrast, the technology-heavy Nasdaq index is down 24% from its March 10 high. Within the S&amp;P 5000, though, there have been some dramatic moves. Utilities are up an astounding 40%, just in thetime since the S&amp;P peaked on March 24, according to Ned Davis Research. Financials and drug stocks are upabout 16% each --- again, since the S&amp;P hit a record. Communications stocks, on the other hand, have fallen 25% in that period. The S&amp;P 5000's big tech stocks aredown more than 19%. Some analysts think the move that is under way is broader than a sector rotation. Some of the least-wanted stocksof 1999 have become desirable this year. As huge stocks, such as Qualcomm and Yahoo!, have sagged, smaller,once-neglected S&amp;P companies, such as Reebok and Allied Waste, have soared. The switch can be seen in an index called the Value Line Arithmetic Index. That index tracks about 1,7000companies and doesn't give any extra weight to the ones with a larger market value. It is a closer reflection of theaverage company, rather than the biggest companies. So far this year, it is up 13%, eclipsing the S&amp;P 5000. The S&amp;P 5000 is weighted according to its members' marketvalue, which means that it is dominated by the larger stocks. The Value Line index's strength compared with theS&amp;P 5000 is a clear indication that some of the smaller stocks are making a comeback, at least for now. Some of the gains do seem to reflect special circumstances. Utilities have been helped by an explosion innatural-gas prices and by a search for stable investments in a turbulent stock market. Many banks and brokeragefirms have benefited from takeover speculation: Merrill Lynch is up 666% so far this year; Lehman Brothers is up69%. If takeover expectations fade, the brokerage stocks risk a slide. And energy companies depend on oil and gasprices, which can make them volatile. Natural-gas bulls note, however, that natural-gas prices are expected toremain high for some time, which could keep propelling that group ahead. \"Very few people thought energy prices would remain this high for as long as they have,\" notes Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;Jenrette investment strategist Thomas Galvin. \"So you still have people underweighted both areas, energy andutilities.\" That means that there still are plenty of skeptics out there. If gas prices stay high, the stocks have room to rise asskeptics are won over. But the real trick during the coming months may not be to be in the right sector, but to be in the right stock, bothmen say. At a time when the economy is slowing and earnings growth will be more difficult, \"you probably want higher-qualitystocks, because they have more stable earnings,\" Mr. Bernstein says. When tech stocks or utility stocks are in favor, it is enough to buy a stock from the group and your stock will go up.Now investors need to be more selective. \"El Paso and Duke Energy are extremely well managed,\" says Mr. Galvin, \"as is Enron. But the rising tide inutilities has lifted all boats, and not all utilities are well enough managed to take advantage of all opportunities.\" The key is choosing the stocks that will withstand the more difficult times to come, and that won't be easy. Peoplewho bought Intel or Oracle at the start of this year probably feel as if it wasn't that bad a year for tech. Both, despitea recent sag, still are up almost 40% this year. Those who chose Microsoft or Dell, however, took a bath: Microsoftis down 45% since the year began, and Dell is down almost 30%. Mr. Galvin thinks tech stocks will stage a fourth-quarter rally, as investors look for companies that can continue tobuild profits in a slowing economy. He points out that analysts expect tech to post 38% earnings growth next year,only a bit less than this year's 41%. But benefiting from any rally would require picking the stocks that will have thegood earnings. Another way of looking at the uncertain future, says Bob Bissell, president of Wells Capital Management, is thatthere could be some unexpected events. Companies whose stock prices have fallen could be acquired, or forced torestructure, which could provide a payoff for investors. \"I am thinking of companies like AT&amp;T,\" he says. \"Something has got to give there. The stock is down to the low30s,\" 47% down from its 52-week high of 61. \"Something has got to happen. Do you fragment the company?\" He also points to midcap stocks, another of the year's strongest performers. \"I call the category `the forgottenprince,' \" he says. The S&amp;P Midcap 4000 index is doing even better than the Value Line index, up 222% since theyear began. Some midcap companies deserve to be forgotten, of course. But the index also contains some smaller banks thatcould be takeover targets, and it has some fast-growing tech companies too. \"It is getting stronger as thetechnological revolution moves companies rapidly from smallcap to midcap,\" Mr. Bissell says. --- Friday's Market Activity Soaring energy prices knocked market averages sharply lower. American Express lost $1.50 to $59.31, Chase Manhattan dropped 1.666 to 49, and General Electric, which has anexposure to the group through its financial-services operations, gave up 2.13 to 56.69. The group also suffered from a cooling in takeover speculation. Lehman Brothers, for example, fell 8 to 142.50,Goldman Sachs lost 4.25 to 124.75 and Bear Stearns gave up 4.75 to 65. Higher oil prices helped Exxon Mobil rise 3.60 to 888.888. It reached a 52-week high, its first since Dec. 9, whileAmerada Hess climbed 4.56 to 73.25, and touched a 52-week high of its own. Database software company Oracle (Nasdaq) fell 6.63 to 78.31, with 60 million shares changing hands. DespiteOracle's announcement of strong quarterly earnings Thursday after the end of normal trading, some analysts saidthey were disappointed with the company's revenue growth. Siebel Systems (Nasdaq), an Oracle competitor, added 4.19 to 999. However, i2 Technologies fell 3.69 to 172.19,while Ariba lost 5.13 to 152.444, both on Nasdaq. Red Hat (Nasdaq) lost 4.06 to 21.19. The Research Triangle Park, N.C., developer of open-source software productsposted a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss, but left some analysts disappointed. Avon Products eased 50 cents to 41.19. The New York beauty-products marketing concern said late Thursday theSecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating a $10 million charge the company took in 1999 related to thewrite-off of computer software. Adobe Systems (Nasdaq) moved up 7.25 to 132.63. The San Jose, Calif., software developer reported fiscalthird-quarter earnings that topped forecasts. Maytag fell 2.19 to 333.63, after the Newton, Iowa, home-appliance maker warned about second-half earnings. Ivax rose 2.38 to 43.63. The Miami pharmaceutical maker received final approved from the Food and DrugAdministration for its generic equivalent of Bristol-Myers Squibb's cancer drug Taxol. Carnival Corp. gained 1.75 to 222.888, while rival Royal Caribbean Cruises advanced 1.75 to 24.50. The stocks roseon hopes that the withdrawal from the market of a smaller competitor will ease excess capacity.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.   Politics &amp; PolicyThe HomestretchBy Gerald F. Seib09/18/2000The Wall Street JournalA40(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)The Gore and Bush campaigns will argue over which did better in the debate over debates, but one winner is clear:PBS news anchor Jim Lehrer. Not only will he moderate all three presidential debates sponsored by the bipartisanCommission on Presidential Debates, but, under an agreement completed over the weekend, he will do so underrules giving him more flexibility than ever before. He will be free to bore in on a specific subject and extenddiscussion of it, rather than simply move on to other questions as in the past. Under the debate agreement, the twocandidates will stand behind lecterns at the opening debate Oct. 3, sit around a table in talk-show fashion on Oct.111, and debate in a town-hall format on Oct. 17. In other campaign developments:--- Housing policy? In the closest thing yet to a campaign debate on housing issues, the Republican party's Website is trying to entice listeners to dial in to radio talk shows and charge that Democrats are running \"The SlumlordTicket.\" Why? On top of a recent controversy over complaints by tenants of a rental house in Tennessee owned byVice President Gore, the Web site touts the story of a similar headache now faced by running mate JosephLieberman. An immigrant mother was evicted when she was injured and fell behind in rent payments at a propertyowned by the estate of Mr. Lieberman's wealthy late uncle; Mr. Lieberman is executor of the estate. --- A fish story: To the list of the perils of holding public office, now add the danger of flying fish. Just ask Rep. HelenChenoweth-Hage, an Idaho Republican, who was pelted with rotting salmon thrown by a 20-year-old protester at ahearing on Western wildfires held in Montana over the weekend. The protester cried out that the conservativecongresswoman is \"the greatest threat to the forest\" and uncorked the salmon.

GE Tops Fortune's Ranking of the World's Most Admired Companies; Key To Staying Ahead of the Pack Is Innovation09/18/2000Business Wire(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Business Wire)NEW YORK---(BUSINESS WIRE)---Sept. 18, 2000---For the third straight year, General Electric, on the strength of itsmanagement team and innovative global strategy, is No. 1 on FORTUNE's ranking of the most admired companiesin the world. FORTUNE's third annual list of Global Most Admired Companies consists of 379 companies in 27industries, with 25 selected as \"all-stars\" for exemplifying leadership on a global scale. Cisco Systems came in atNo. 2 on the all-star ranking (up from No. 8 in 1999); other repeat performers in the top ten include Microsoft, whosebattles with government regulators on one flank and perceptions of a foundering Internet strategy on the othercaused it to slip to No. 3 from No. 2; Intel (No.4); and Wal-Mart Stores, which moved up to No. 5 from No. 7. Thecomplete list of FORTUNE's Global Most Admired Companies appears in the October 2 issue of FORTUNE and isavailable at ww.fortune.com as of Monday, Sept.18, at 8:30 a.m. According to Nicholas Stein's article, \"The World's Most Admired Companies,\" the schizophrenic market conditionsof the past year offer one reason why the Most Admired list looks so different this year. As Stein writes: \"Thewinners are companies that demonstrated a new-economy style growth strategy while maintaining an old-economyapproach to fiscal responsibility.\" And, as Vicki Wright, global managing director of the Hay Group consultancy thathelped produce the list with FORTUNE notes: \"There is something new this year in how we perceive companies. Itis the emphasis on how much companies are capable of looking forward. In a year when old-economy companieshave not seen their share price perform, those that have managed to weather both the old- and new-economystorms will flourish.\"Notable changes among this year's Global Most Admired list include Home Depot leaping from No. 20 to No. 9,Toyota moving up from No. 16 to No. 10, and Citgroup advancing from No. 25 to No. 18. Strong demand for Sony'sflat-screen TVs, digital cameras, and PlayStation game consoles helped the company move up from 14 to 6.Newcomers to this year's list --- Enron, Nokia, Charles Schwab, UPS, and Goldman Sachs --- all embody businesstrategies that bridge the old and new economic worlds. Companies that lost their all-star status --- IBM,Hewlett-Packard, AT&amp;T, Procter &amp; Gamble, DaimlerChrysler --- have been plagued with difficulties integrating newbusiness concepts. Many of the industry categories also experienced significant turnover. Among airline companies, Singapore Airlines,which didn't even make last year's list, took the top spot from Southwest. British Airways, hobbled by internalconflict and heightened competition, fell from third to seventh. Though Intel held on to the top ranking in thecomputer hardware and software category, Sun Microsystems rode the dot-com revolution to second place, up fromsixth last year, while Dell, facing a wireless (and PC-less) future, fell from fifth to eighth. And in the white-hotnetwork communications and Internet technology sector, all-star newcomer Nokia edged Cisco Systems for topbilling. To find out what unique management qualities set these companies apart from their peers, the Hay Group surveyedthe Most Admired Companies and their less admired peers about the performance measures they use to chart theprogress of their companies. According to their findings, Most Admired companies set more challenging goals, link the compensation of theirexecutives more closely to the completion of those goals, and are generally more oriented toward long-termperformance. To complete the list of the world's most admired companies, FORTUNE consulted the experts: the businessexecutives who run companies, and the analysts who study them. Global companies were rated according to eightcriteria: quality of management; quality of products or services; innovativeness; long-term investment value; financialsoundness; ability to attract, develop and retain talent; community responsibility; and use of corporate assets. Toreflect this list's international scope, a ninth category was added: global business acumen. A company's overallranking is the average of the scores of all nine attributes. Companies are ranked within their industry, and the top 25--- the All-Stars --- are culled from across all industry groups. The October 2 issue is available on newsstands beginning September 25.

I was flying over Bolivia's Chiquitano Forest as I read your article on the \"old-time gas company\" Enron [BUSINESS, Aug. 28]. Over the past year, this forest, the largest remnant of intact primary dry tropical forest in the world, has been bisected by a 30-ft.-wide gash for construction of a gas pipeline by Enron and Shell. Enron in its quest for profit has ignored the scientific advice of conservation organizations to maintain the ecological integrity of this endangered forest ecosystem. Enron and Shell decided to open the 10 million- acre forest to fragmentation and deforestation by their pipeline. Enron may be keeping pace with advancing technologies to plow ahead in global markets, but its environmental practices are Byzantine and pose a global threat to biodiversity. PATRICIA CAFFREY World Wildlife Fund-Bolivia Santa Cruz, Bolivia Arena foes launch bid to defeat new plan By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Wednesday, October 4, 2000A handful of activists, including a Harris County Green Party official and several low-tax proponents, launched an effort Tuesday to defeat a second plan to build a downtown arena. Unlike the 1999 opposition campaign, this year's anti-arena movement is not seeking a better financing deal for taxpayers. These activists want no arena at all. Although this year's opponents lack the nearly $7000,000 their higher-profile predecessors spent last year, that has done little to diminish their rhetoric. \"Should we spend our city's limited resources on building up rich guys, or do we spend it building up our communities?\" asked activist DeWayne Lark, standing in front of City Hall. \"There will be no more corporate welfare in Harris County.\" Pro-arena campaign officials said Tuesday's event, which came about three weeks after their own kickoff, was more notable for who did not attend than for who did. Houston Aeros owner Chuck Watson, who funded a large chunk of last year's anti-arena effort, has endorsed the new deal. Gracie Saenz, a former city councilwoman and mayoral candidate who campaigned against the 1999 deal, also supports the new agreement. And although the Harris County Republican Party --- the primary organizer of the 1999 anti-arena effort --- has declined to support the new deal, it has not been as active in opposition as some of its members had hoped. In the GOP's stead this year is the Harris County Green Party, represented by Nathalie Paravicini, who said she rejects the argument that professional sports are critical to a city's identity. Arena boosters say a new downtown facility will promote Houston's image as a world-class city. \"Civic pride is not measured by a sports team that is ready to leave town at the drop of a hat,\" she said. And organizers of the anti-arena campaign also suggested that conservative political activist Bruce Hotze would announce plans Thursday to take a major role in their efforts, possibly becoming campaign manager. Although Hotze lacks the political and financial stature of the pro-arena campaign co-chairmen, Enron Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay and former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, he comes from a politically active family that can raise large amounts of money. Hotze has said he does not believe government should be involved in building sports stadiums, but he has declined to say how much he was willing to get involved in the anti-arena effort. Lark said Hotze told him that he will actively raise funds to fight the arena. The group is expected to form a political action committee this week to collect contributions. The philosophy of the anti-sports-arena efforts has reverted to its 19996 form, when a similar grass-roots effort coalesced to oppose the referendum to build a baseball stadium, which voters approved. That underfunded effort also opposed any public spending on stadiums, rather than merely trying to extract a better deal from team owners. Arena proponents this year have attracted most of their former foes, and certainly the best-known, to their ranks by altering the original proposal, which failed with voters last year by 10 percentage points. Still, they acknowledge that there will always be opposition in high-profile contests. \"We never expected this to be a unanimous vote,\" said Jordan, the co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign, Let's Build it Together. \"Some people will vote against anything.\" FRANCE: Europe online power markets seen pressuring brokers.By Stuart Penson10/03/2000Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2000.PARIS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Online trading is set to sweep through Europe's power markets, sending transaction fees sharply lower and piling the pressure on traditional brokers, industry executives and consultants said on Tuesday. Scores of web-based trading platforms, offering a variety of functions, are expected to enter the European wholesale power market in the near term, forcing brokers who work over the telephone to rethink their approach, they told an energy conference.\"Transaction fees in Europe are already falling and I think we're going to see a big decline over the next six months,\" said Gilbert Toppin, principal of Deloitte Consulting's European e-business practice. \"Voice broking could become a distant memory,\" he told Reuters during the Powerisk 2000 conference. Leading the online charge in Europe's wholesale power market are EnronOnline, which launched last year, and HoustonStreet.com, which started up last week and is already planning to expand into Scandinavia. EnronOnline is a bilateral market in which Enron is always one party to a deal. HoustonStreet is a multilateral exchange. The major advantages for online markets over telephone brokers are seen as lower transaction costs and the ability to display a far wider range of prices to clients. Also, online trading is anonymous, which is attractive to traders, said Mark Crosno, president of electronic trading services at Altra Energy Technologies of the US. Altra is a partner with National Grid in EnMO in the UK, a consortium which runs a screen-based gas trading market and is planning to launch a power exchange. Many traditional brokers are still deciding how to respond to the online challenge. \"A lot of brokers are scratching their heads because there are going to be 20 or 25 electronic exchanges out there,\" said Per-Otto Wold, managing director of Natsource-Tullett Europe, one of Europe's biggest power brokers. Wold argued that doing a trade over the telephone was still, in most cases, the quickest method. And that would remain so until voice recognition enabled traders to \"talk\" to the screens on their desks. He expected brokers to focus on longer dated trades and options while online markets would capture a greater share of trading in short term, high volume contracts. The provision of market information and traders' liking for personal contact over the telephone would also help to preserve a niche for the voice brokers, said Wold. \"The markets are still going to need somebody to massage the markets, and that is where the brokers come in,\" he said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Lance Stroud of New York, Renard D. Euell of Denver and Ronald Peek of Tallahassee, Fla., all had dreams of becoming oil barons. And on Oct. 4, when the Department of Energy announced the results of the bidding for oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they thought their ships had come in. Two of the three black entrepreneurs were unknowns in the industry, and none of them had ever done a major oil deal. But there they were, listed as winning bidders alongside some of the biggest names in the business --- Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., BP Amoco PLC and Amerada Hess Corp. Each would be given the right to withdraw millions of barrels of oil from the reserve amid one of the most volatile oil markets in decades. In exchange, each had offered to replace that oil, plus an additional amount akin to an interest payment, a year later. They and the other winning bidders, the Energy Department said, were picked soley because they pledged to return the biggest quantities of oil to the reserve. There was just one catch: In its rush to release the oil and so ease a price crunch, the Energy Department had suspended its usual requirement that each bidder supply financial guarantees. But it wanted the winning bidders to present letters of credit, equal to the oil's market value, five days after their bids were submitted. The big players could easily meet that requirement. But Messrs. Stroud, Euell and Peek were men of limited means. They needed to find someone willing to back them for tens of millions of dollars --- and fast. The drama made for an unaccustomed scene in Harlem, where the 35-year-old Mr. Stroud lived with his 74-year-old mother. A heavy-set man with a goatee, Mr. Stroud, a former Army enlisted man who had dropped out of college shy of graduation, had held a string of odd jobs while using the Internet to seek out a big business deal. The aspiring oil man had entered his bid for four million barrels from the reserve, via the Internet. He won't discuss the details of his bid, but says he thought he could outbid the large oil companies because he didn't have as much overhead. After the winning bids were announced, Mr. Stroud became something of a celebrity. TV news crews arrived to interview his neighbors, many of whom had no idea what all the fuss was about. \"I thought he [Mr. Stroud] was some kind of rap star,\" recalls Carline Thomas, who lives down the hall from him. As neighbors paused to shoot the breeze on the steps of nearby residential buildings, most marred by graffiti, Wall Street couriers bearing fat packets of information spent the week scurrying back and forth from Mr. Stroud's apartment on a seedy block in Harlem's central business district. Inside Mr. Stroud's apartment, the telephone wouldn't stop ringing, and his mother was helping him field the calls. He says he was in serious talks with four companies. And a movie producer was interested in his life story. Then, amid the chaos, tragedy struck. On Tuesday night, his mother, Iris Manning, suffered a cardiac arrest, and was taken to a hospital a few blocks south of Mr. Stroud's apartment. Mr. Stroud said he spent most of Wednesday running between his apartment and the hospital, taking occasional phone calls to deal with prospective financiers. Ms. Manning went into cardiac arrest three more times, and died at 9:47 p.m. Wednesday evening. Mr. Stroud was dazed by the fact that what he called the two biggest events of his life --- the death of his mother and his selection by the Energy Department --- occurred almost simultaneously. \"I'm saying `there must be some reason I'm here,' \" he said later. \"These things happening like this, the odds must be in the millions.\" Mr. Stroud won't discuss which companies were vying for his oil, but he says at one point he thought he had an offer to buy him out for $1.50 a barrel, or $6 million. The most serious discussions began Thursday, with a representative from a refining company, which he refuses to name. From that discussion Thursday until the following evening, Mr. Stroud says, he was confident that the refiner would grant him the letter of credit he needed. But at 9 p.m. Friday, three hours before his deadline, Mr. Stroud said he got a call telling him the deal was off. \"I was upset,\" he says. \"I mean, instead of wasting my time with that I could have obtained the financing quickly\" from some other source. A spokesman for Koch Industries Inc., based in Wichita, Kan., said it was in negotiations with both Messrs. Euell and Stroud. \"We invited them to make a deal that made economic sense.\" BP Amoco said it also had discussions with Mr. Stroud. Mr. Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension, under the circumstances. \"If your mother passes, aren't you given three days to grieve?\" Mr. Stroud asks. His mother's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday, which would have been her 75th birthday, he says. Mr. Euell ran a small company, Euell Energy Resources, whose 12 employees helped him broker natural-gas sales and other small energy deals. By night, he worked the phones from his home in a modest Denver suburb, calling oil producers in Nigeria and energy brokers in Singapore and Sydney, always looking for the big score that would make him rich. A friend, Norman Early, a sometime golfing partner and a former Denver U.S. district attorney, says the 50-year-old Mr. Euell is \"one of those guys who shoots for the stars.\" On Oct. 4, Mr. Euell thought he had hit one. He had been awarded the right to withdraw three million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in exchange for returning 3.3 million barrels a year later. That was enough oil to fill 14,019 conventional tank trucks. Knowing he would need a partner to provide financial backing, Mr. Euell had already placed a call to a man he'd never met: Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp. He said he was sure he was going to be one of the top bidders for the reserve oil. Would Enron like to be his partner? Within a few hours John Nolan, the giant energy company's vice president in charge of trading, called from London. Enron , he said, was interested. By Oct. 6, the price of oil had already fallen, making Mr. Euell's bid look generous. Still, he felt bullish. \"I'm betting on Mother Nature, that she's coming back this winter and that oil's going to be more valuable.\" It wasn't Mother Nature, but the crisis in the Middle East that turned things around. Monday, Oct. 9, the target price for November oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, jumped a dollar to $31.86 a barrel and headed higher. Mr. Euell flew to Houston and took a room at the Hyatt Regency, from which he could see Enron 's 50-story office tower. By Tuesday, the price of oil had hit $333.18. By Mr. Euell's calculations that meant a $3 million profit for him and an equal amount for his prospective partner just across the street. Enron 's lawyers were working on an agreement that would substitute Enron as the major party in Mr. Euell's contract, he said, and were drawing up the letter of credit for $93 million that the DOE required. Eager to close the deal, Mr. Euell called Enron trader Patrick Danaher, who was working on the project. \"I want to sign this thing up today,\" Mr. Euell told him, claiming that he had received an offer from another, unnamed firm, offering to buy his contract for $1.2 million. According to tapes of the conversation provided by Enron , Mr. Danaher said the paperwork was under way: \"Let me see if we can do that today.\" Mr. Euell called backed at 111:30 a.m. and again at 111:45 a.m. Each time, the trader sounded more pessimistic. Prospects were \"50-50.\" When Mr. Euell suggested he had other offers, Mr. Danaher told him: \"If you have a bid at $1.2 million, you should take it. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I just have to tell you that.\" Still, he invited Mr. Euell to dinner. Tuesday's deadline passed without dinner or any action from Enron . While it appears from the tapes that the parties had been close to an accord, Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron 's trading branch, says: \"At no time was there anything remotely resembling a deal with Mr. Euell.\" Mr. Euell got the DOE to agree to extend the deadline for another 24 hours and, after a round of frantic phone calls, says he collected pledges from a group of European banks to support the $93 million letter of credit. But, when the new deadline expired, he still had failed to get the proper paperwork to the DOE, which then declared his award to have lapsed. \"They played me,\" Mr. Euell complains, blaming Enron for the missed deadlines. Still, he says, the experience amounted to an instant \"Ph.D.\" in oil. Next time, he vows, he will have his own letter of credit. The DOE said late last week that it will accept new bids on the seven million barrels of oil Messrs. Stroud and Euell forfeited. As for Mr. Peek, he remains the mystery man of the three. His company, Burhany Energy Industries Inc., was formed Aug. 21. It employs no one but Mr. Peek himself. Staffers at the Florida Black Business Investment Board, where Mr. Peek works as a business-development specialist, said he had taken last week off. Shutters were drawn at his modest, one-story house in Tallahassee. Phone calls to Mr. Peek were forwarded to an unidentified neighbor. In an e-mail to a reporter, Mr. Peek apologized for being unreachable. He was \"working relentlessly to consummate this transaction\" and couldn't \"entertain any distraction at the moment.\" On Saturday, the Department of Energy announced that Mr. Peek had successfully transferred his interest in three million barrels of government oil to Hess Energy Trading Co. of New York, a partnership that includes Amerada Hess. Amerada Hess Vice President Carl Tursi said he could give few details of the deal, except to say that he believes there was an \"arrangement\" that resulted in \"a lot of money\" for Mr. Peek.

All Rights Reserved Rockville-based Artesia Technologies wasn't just interested in another venture capital investment. It wanted partners. In its recent $26 million funding, the digital asset management company's second round, its venture capital lead was joined by a group of \"strategic partners.\" Artesia wanted to form relationships with other information management companies, instead of working only with banks or venture capital firms. \"We wanted to make it more of a partnership with other companies,\" said Brian Hedquist, Artesia's marketing communications manager. For example, in September, Vignette Corp. of Austin announced an agreement with Artesia to create an Internet commerce application. Now with Vignette's investment, the relationship is strengthened. \"It's not a pure financial investment,\" said Hedquist of the equity stake Vignette and the other strategic partners have in Artesia. \"They have a vested interest. We're all going to benefit.\" Artesia was born last year in a management-led buyout with the help of $25 million from Warburg Pincus. CEO Chris Veator created the company when he and a group of insiders led a buyout of the information management division of Boston-based financial information giant Thomson Financial Corp. Veator's idea was to jump into digital asset management for a broad array of clients, not just managing information for publishing companies and new organizations. \"We found very quickly,\" Veator said, \"that the real opportunity was not just in the publishing community.\" Company officials said the funding will help Artesia pursue more international expansion opportunities, the primary focus of which will be Europe, where Artesia opened a London office last June. Also, the financing will be used to increase the sales and marketing staff. Veator expects the staff to double and revenue to triple over the next 12 months, though he declined to give any financial information.

Blocks away, the Rockets and most of the city's political and business elite are asking voters for a new basketball arena. Yet, if voters approve the construction in the Nov. 7 election, the game still would be played indoors on a hardwood floor. An arena is, after all, an arena, and basketball already is played in Houston the way it was meant to be. The team points to such fan benefits as a flashier show, with modern video and sound equipment, and a more competitive team funded by higher revenues. The arena's influential backers say an arena would spur downtown development, strengthen the economy and help affirm Houston's position as a world-class city. For nonfans, it's difficult to predict how many of these benefits an arena actually would generate. More calculable is the financial effect it would have on Rockets owner Leslie Alexander and, to a lesser extent, the city of Houston. Compared with his bare-bones lease at Compaq Center, Alexander and the 12 players who wear his uniform stand to benefit greatly. Based on estimates from other new arenas, Alexander stands to reap $30 million to $45 million more a year were he to go from being a tenant at Compaq Center to being landlord of a new arena. For about $7 million a year, Alexander would enjoy revenue from such sources as 1000 luxury suites, premium club seating near the court, selling the building's name and even bestowing upon Miller, Coors or some other brewer the right to sell $6 beers. Granted, going from tenant to landlord would boost his costs. Less the rent he now pays at Compaq Center, Alexander would spend $8 million to $10 million a year to keep the lights on. For players, there's no such overhead. They would share the windfall. Under the collective bargaining agreement ratified in January 1999, most revenues collected by NBA owners are stirred into a mythical pot, out of which 555 percent is divided by the number of teams to determine a salary cap. For the city's part, it would spend less money buying and preparing land for the arena under this year's deal, with expenses capped at $20 million. A different location chosen in last year's plan would have cost the city at least $15 million more. Both this year and last the city was to own the land and arena after 30 years. Now the city would get a parking garage, too. In the revised agreement, the city also would receive $2000,000 a year, use of the arena for convention-related events or fund-raisers on 20 days a year, and a suite between the free-throw lines. It's a \"much better deal\" for Houston, says Mayor Lee Brown, who, as a chief negotiator and supporter of the previous deal, is among the least likely to make such admissions. City officials have valued the suite at $250,000 to $5000,000 because it would allow Houston to woo convention center customers. The Rockets plan to sell the suites for $1000,000 to $150,000 each. The suite actually could cost more than it is worth if the city opts to cater games for visitors. This year, the sports authority spent about $65,000 on food for about 80 dates at Enron Field. There would be at least twice as many events in the arena. The public would make its greatest contribution through the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority. That board would sell bonds to cover the arena's $175 million design and construction cost. Appointed by the city and county to collect hotel and car rental taxes to finance stadium construction, the 13-member sports authority also would repay a $30 million loan --- interest-free for the first five years --- from business leaders earmarked for a parking garage. What does the public get in return? \"Something much bigger,\" said Ken Lay, co-chairman of the pro-arena campaign. \"It's making Houston, Texas, and particularly downtown, a much more viable economic area. Making it more attractive for business to come to town, making it more attractive for conventions to come to town, and making it more attractive for the best and brightest talent in the world to come here and work with us.\" Moreover, supporters say a downtown arena, with its advanced sound and video systems, wider concourses, scores of restrooms and a constellation of eateries, would be like going from a phonograph to a hi-fi stereo. Some longtime Compaq Center patrons who have visited new arenas agree. \"When people go to Enron Field they've had an experience,\" said fan Rebecca Tonahill, 53, who attends a couple of dozen Rockets and Comets games a year and has traveled to Los Angeles and Indianapolis arenas that opened last year. \"You don't get an experience at Compaq Center, but I think they could capture some of that with the new arena.\" Overall analyses of the deal's bottom-line cost vary by how much the sports authority loses, if anything, from building the parking garage. Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt calculates the Rockets would pay only 30 percent of the arena's total cost, which comes to $256 million by his tally, and the public would pay the remainder. Ric Campo, the sports authority's financial whiz, contends the team's contribution would be closer to half of the $2220 million he estimates as the total cost. Depending on how the numbers are manipulated, both are right. Bettencourt believes the public would pay the parking garage's entire $35 million cost. A sore spot among tax watchdogs has been the sports authority building a garage that Alexander will have exclusive profit from during his events, including games involving the Rockets and Comets basketball teams and ThunderBears arena football team. Still, said Campo, the sports authority has use of the garage at all other times, which he says would be enough to cover annual garage payments. The private loan is interest-free for the first five years, which would save $9 million. What is clear is that taxpayers would spend between $125 million and $175 million to build an arena that would create wealth for a few. Arena opponents call it corporate welfare. Supporters say it's a good investment. It has happened before, to an even greater extent, with the construction of Enron Field for Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. and the football stadium for Houston Texans owner Bob McNair. \"This point always raises serious questions about balance in people's minds,\" said Dennis Howard, a sports marketing professor at the University of Oregon. \"Those paying the greatest share are not getting the benefit. They often can't even afford to go.\" The counter-argument from arena supporters is that visitors pay most hotel and car rental taxes. Bettencourt has studied the issue and concluded that locals pay at least 30 percent of the visitor taxes. Howard's research suggests about one of every 10 people who live in a market where a major-league sports team gets a new building ends up using the facility in a given year. However, the study did not differentiate arenas from football or baseball stadiums. Arenas probably would attract more people because of the many nonsporting events held there. Not only do fans pay for the building with taxes, they are hit again by more expensive tickets, said Howard, noting that average ticket prices jump by 30 to 40 percent in a new building. The Rockets disputed that, citing a study of six recently opened arenas where prices jumped from 7 to 28 percent. The team's chief operating officer, George Postolos, said the Rockets have not raised the price of the most affordable tickets in five years. He said the team would remain committed to keeping a comparable number of affordable seats in a new arena. Customers buying expensive tickets, typically corporations, would feel the bulk of the increase. \"Premium seat holders get more in a new building,\" he said, \"and they pay more for it.\" Houston voters, at least, have a fairly clear idea of who is getting what in this deal. \"It's all right there on the table,\" notes Bob Eury, president of Central Houston Inc. That is not always the case when teams and governments are eager collaborators in search of public support. In Indianapolis, for instance, local media suggested the agreement to build the $183 million Conseco Fieldhouse involved $104 million in private money and $79 million in public money. One reporter writing in the Indianapolis Star's special arena-opening section went as far as to write: \"This isn't Houston or Hartford, Conn., or those other cities that swung open the public vault when it came time to pony up for new sports facilities.\" An arena built with less public than private money in such a small market would be something worth bragging about. The reality in the bond documents is much different: The city's capital improvement board sold $222.6 million worth of bonds to finance the arena and a parking garage. Those bonds will be repaid by a dizzying array of taxes, including a cigarette tax, car-rental tax, hotel tax, a tax on goods sold at the arena, and a diversion of state income taxes on player's salaries. The private contributions come from $10 million worth of donated land, a $37 million loan to be repaid by the city, and, as touted by the Star, $57 million from the Pacers basketball team. But the Pacers' \"contribution\" is made up almost entirely of revenues the city expects to generate from the arena's publicly financed parking garage when the team is not using it, according to an attorney who worked on the bond sale. Advertising for the arena in Houston so far has been accurate, but there are two sides to some of the numbers presented. A common claim is that the Rockets would pay $8.5 million a year in rent, appearing most recently in an Oct. 1 opinion piece by sports authority Chairman Billy Burge. This implies that more than half the $13 million to $14 million the sports authority would pay on its arena debt each year would come from the Rockets. Actually, of this \"rent,\" $1.6 million would be put into a fund for major arena repairs. Another $1.5 million would be paid to the sports authority, but if the sports authority could pay its annual debts, the money would be refunded to the Rockets. The sports authority would have enough money to pay its debt on three stadiums if its tax revenues rise at 3 percent. They have grown at around 10 percent in recent years. Finally, another $2000,000 of the \"rent\" is paid to the city. Boosters also commonly promote arenas to voters as engines of economic development, generating millions of dollars in sales taxes. But even if the teams left, most personal leisure spending would simply be spent on movies, the arts or other forms of entertainment, said John Siegfried, a Vanderbilt University economics professor. The other major chunk, from sales taxes on corporate spending at the arenas, often comes from advertising budgets, he said, and there are other promotional activities where the money could be spent. \"Repeatedly, we're finding the emperor has no clothes,\" said Howard, of Oregon. \"These buildings are sold as economic development engines, but the economic impact they create is negligible.\" Studies by professional consultants may, and often do, find otherwise, but they are usually commissioned by a team or government seeking to justify public spending on a new facility, Siegfried said. Campo countered that building Enron Field has already fueled local economic gain from higher property tax revenues. The ballpark's 10 blocks of land were purchased at $12 per square foot, he said. A single block across the street was recently sold for $1000 a square foot to Trammel Crow. Land values around the arena site have likewise doubled within the last year on speculation of development there. \"That's creating a lot of value for the city, county and schools,\" Campo said. Economists, including four interviewed for this article, argue that spending public money in other ways, such as tax abatements to developers, would stimulate even more activity. They point to research in respected economic journals that has found higher high school graduation rates and more spending on police encouraged economic growth, whereas a major-league sports team actually put a drag on the economy. By Texas law, the sports authority may not spend the taxes it collects on a venue unless it is approved by voters, and it may spend its revenue only on sports facilities or other community projects like an arts center. Its 2 percent hotel tax and 5 percent car rental tax will not rise if the arena proposition passes. Adding arena payments to its existing debt would completely tap its resources, however. The board has not addressed what to do if the arena fails. To spend money on anything other than an approved venue, such as hospitals or schools as opponents suggest, would require legislative action. Return to top   OUTLOOKEditorialsFOR ARENA / Many concrete reasons to support this proposal Nov. 7Staff10/15/2000Houston Chronicle4 STAR2(Copyright 2000)Houstonians are no strangers to the many arguments for and against the building of new sports arenas. We've hashed and rehashed them often in the past few years. We've put one facility - Enron Field for baseball downtown - on the map, and we're erecting another - a new football/rodeo stadium at the site of the Astrodome. A decision on a third piece - a downtown basketball/hockey arena - is forthcoming on the Nov. 7 election ballot.The Chronicle urges voters to vote for the arena referendum. It makes sense for Houston to finish the third leg of this sports facility package as both a quality-of-life amenity and a valuable economic development tool. The arena proposal is essentially the same one, in terms of financing, as the others that were approved by voters in 19996. Tax dollars will be spent sparingly, taxpayer liability is limited, and taxpayers are even protected from having to pick up cost overruns. The fact there is a relative consensus on the proposal, or at least a lack of vigorous opposition as there was on a previous proposal, is a signal that this deal is a better one for Houston. The building's tenants, the Houston Rockets and Comets, are paying a fair share of the costs. Ticket and parking taxes have been eliminated from the new proposal. Many people find the \"corporate welfare\" aspect of publicly financed arenas distasteful, and some of their concerns have merit. But the reality is that major league sports teams are amenities that help cities and all of their residents. That's part of the reason so many cities compete to have them and retain them. Houstonians have debated this issue for years, and some people will adhere, no matter what, to the philosophy that sports teams shouldn't be publicly subsidized. Continued debate won't change their minds. We believe the presence of sports teams and facilities such as these is a plus for the city that far outweighs the public costs. It's not an esoteric, theoretical discussion. The proof is concrete - as concrete as the 18 new projects developed in downtown around Enron Field. They include a mix of residential, office and entertainment facilities totaling about $7000 million. The economic activity these enterprises generate is already a boon to Houston's economy. The property value they add to the tax rolls will more than offset the public investment costs of Enron Field. Some critics of the arena have posited the theory that funds needed for public safety, such as improvements to the Fire Department, will be raided or shortchanged by the city's commitment to the arena. But that's simply not the case. The increased property taxes and other benefits of a more dynamic downtown will repay the city's investment many times over. That's new tax money available to the city's general fund, which pays for police and fire protection. So, it's not an either-or decision. Furthermore, what the stadium and all this activity have done for downtown, and for Houston's image as a whole, is quite remarkable. Remember, downtown's northeast quadrant was was a virtual ghost town of dilapidated warehouses and empty fields only a few months ago. Enron Field, coupled with Theater District development and other projects, has put to rest almost every argument that was made against the building of that stadium. A downtown arena would help complete the renaissance of the area and would put money into the public coffers. These are all strong reasons to vote enthusiastically for the arena proposal on Nov. 7.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. AIs new arena deal a slam-dunk for taxpayers? / Houston's costs, funding for NBA team compared to other citiesERIC BERGERStaff10/15/2000Houston Chronicle2 STAR1(Copyright 2000)Those who support subsidizing an arena to keep the Houston Rockets in Space City hail the deal struck this summer. It's better for taxpayers than last year's accord, they say. It's comparable to what the Astros and Texans got. Perhaps more important, they say, the agreement Houstonians will vote on Nov. 7 is a \"market deal\" that compares favorably with other arenas built in recent years for National Basketball Association teams.But does it really? A Houston Chronicle study of the seven most recently built U.S. arenas for NBA clubs reveals that four were constructed with less tax money than will be spent here if voters approve next month's arena proposition. One had a slightly larger public contribution and two were built with considerably more public money. There are good reasons for this, arena boosters contend. Unlike Houston, three of these four cities offering lesser subsidies provided other incentives. In Dallas and Los Angeles, they note, the government condemned whole blocks of land for private development around the arena. In Atlanta, Ted Turner was given carte blanche to develop public land. All of the markets that received a smaller subsidy also had both major league basketball and hockey teams, which could share the construction costs. Two teams generate more revenue, which tends to make the public contribution less vital. \"This is one of the largest single-team contributions to a building ever,\" said Rockets Chief Operating Officer George Postolos, whose team is paying about $7 million a year for control of the Houston arena. Still, there is another general rule of thumb when it comes to determining a public subsidy. Historically, the less populous a city and its suburbs, the more public money is needed to complete an arena project. With their bevy of Fortune 5000 companies, larger cities far outstrip the mid-sized markets' capacity to buy the pricey suites and club seats that make new arenas so lucrative for NBA owners. Strikingly, an arena was built with far fewer tax dollars in one city smaller than Houston - Denver. Atlanta, a market comparable to Houston, built an arena with considerably less public money. This was also the case in two larger markets. Los Angeles built an arena with almost no public money, and Dallas' expensive project had substantially less public than private money involved. Only two of the cities reviewed, San Antonio and Indianapolis, built arenas with larger public money contributions, which is consistent with their relatively small market stature. \"The arena deal follows the Enron Field-type of model,\" said Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt, who released a study critical of Houston's arena plan but has not campaigned against it. \"It's consistent with how the baseball and football stadiums were built in Houston. \"But it's clearly not the model for arenas in the rest of the country, from Los Angeles to Atlanta to Denver.\" Conservative activist Bruce Hotze, who recently launched an effort against the arena, says Houston should follow the example of other cities where the owners of sports teams - such as the Utah Jazz in 19991 - have primarily paid for their facilities. He characterizes anything less as corporate welfare. The list of factors determining how far a team can dip into public coffers goes on, from the breadth of a team's local following to its success and its owner's popularity, said Andrew Zimbalist, a Smith College economics professor. But the overriding factor is probably simpler, he said. \"The best strategy for any team to follow is to ask for so much money that the referendum passes by a tenth of a percentage point,\" Zimbalist said. \"Teams will get as much as they can. If it passes by 5 percent, the owner, usually a smart businessman, has done himself a disservice.\" Another big factor is a threat to move. This has loomed over Houston since NBA Commissioner David Stern announced earlier this year that he was \"certain\" the Rockets would leave town without a new building. When the Denver Nuggets wanted a new arena in the mid-19990s they had a decade left on their lease. The Rockets have just three years left before they can leave Houston. Otherwise, Denver's circumstances as its leaders began negotiating with the team were remarkably similar to Houston's. The city had just spent about $2000 million in public money to build Coors Field for the Colorado Rockies baseball team, and was contemplating an even larger expenditure to replace Mile High Stadium for the NFL's Broncos. But when it came to the city-owned McNichols Arena, built, like Compaq Center, in 1975, the attitude was that if the team's owner wanted a new building he would have to do it largely with public money, said Dean Bonham, a Denver-based sports consultant. Eventually, the owner got some city concessions totaling about $30 million but paid for all the arena's construction costs. A few years later in Houston, after building Enron Field and ponying up for a new football stadium, public leaders have signed a similar, heavily subsidized plan for the basketball team. What was it that opened Houston's treasury when Denver's was closed? \"I can sum the difference up in one word: leverage,\" Bonham said. \"The Denver teams weren't going anywhere soon. The Rockets got a green light to go.\" In Miami, a smaller market where a building was constructed with slightly more public money than would be spent in Houston, the Heat's first arena was only 8 years old when the team asked for a new facility. At first team officials, amid threats of leaving, managed to cut a deal with the Miami-Dade County Commission to build a $165 million arena on Biscayne Bay with only $50 million coming from the team. But leading up to a referendum a new county mayor, Alex Penelas, was elected in part because he campaigned against public financing for the arena, saying the county had \"given away the kitchen sink.\" Later, a deal was struck in which the team paid for the arena's construction and the county bought bayfront property and helped the team with annual operating costs. This dramatic game of building publicly backed sports stadiums with questionable public support is so familiar throughout the United States that it has practically become the fifth major league sport. More than $21.7 billion has been spent or committed on 95 built or planned big-league stadiums since 19990, and, according to several economists' calculations, two-thirds of that money comes from public sources. In Houston, more than two-thirds of the nearly $1 billion in built, planned or proposed stadiums since 19996 has or would come from public sources. In spring 19996, citing aging facilities and unprofitable leases, the Oilers had left town and the Astros were making threats. The still-champion Rockets were bound here into the new century, but would soon sue to break that lease and were making no promises beyond 20003. The Astrodome and Compaq Center had lost their sheen amid a nationwide tide of stadium building that is only now ebbing. Political leaders decided they must do something to stop the defection of Houston's pro sports teams. For several months, a blue-ribbon commission chaired by Pete Coneway and Ben Love tackled the issue, ultimately deciding, as elsewhere around the country, that the city and county should help build new facilities for baseball, football and basketball. From this blueprint arose the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority, which has helped fund two of those facilities and is seeking voter approval to spend its remaining tax revenues on a new downtown basketball arena. The Astros hit the jackpot with Enron Field, which has propelled their attendance to more than 3 million for the first time. After the Oilers made good on their threat to move to Nashville, it took Bob McNair's $7000 million and Texas charm, as well as a $367 million football stadium, to bring the NFL back. Sports authority members say that if McNair's experience teaches Houston anything, it will take a far greater investment than the proposed arena's costs to return the NBA should the Rockets leave. They point out as well that in building both the baseball and football stadiums, although each cost more than the arena, Alexander would pay more than has either McNair or Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. Houston's arena deal, as complicated as it appears, lacks the hidden value attached to some other deals, which Rockets officials say makes sports team owners in the other markets appear less mercenary at first blush. More than two years ago Dallas voters approved a $125 million public contribution to a new arena by a handful of votes in a citywide referendum. A scrappy coalition of opponents, which had only $75,000 to spend, tried to point out that the public was giving up much more than the $125 million. Beneath that widely reported figure was essentially freedom for the arena developers, Dallas Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr. and Dallas Stars owner Tom Hicks, to proceed with an 18-city block, $1 billion overall development with the city's blessing. In January, Perot sold the Mavericks basketball team to Internet billionaire Mark Cuban. Perot, who had bought the team only four years earlier, said he was interested in the new arena largely for the related development opportunities. \"A lot of people look at a basketball team as an anchor tenant for an arena. I look at an arena as the anchor tenant for a much larger program,\" he said upon selling the Mavericks. His Hillwood Development Corp. retained the development rights. To aid the development, the city of Dallas condemned much of the land and offered as much as $30 million for infrastructure work to spruce up the property. The city also let both the Stars, a hockey team, and Mavericks out of their Reunion Arena leases several years early and went so far as to ensure no other sports referendums would be on the same ballot. Hillwood also got a 4 percent construction management fee and Hicks 1.5 percent as part of the $325 million in public and private money spent on the arena. \"Oh sure, there were kickbacks and all that,\" said Sharon Boyd, co- chairwoman of the opposition group It's a Bad Deal! \"It was like all of a sudden there were five men in Dallas that got free land and didn't have to pay taxes. That's a sweet deal.\" Like Dallas, Atlanta offered Ted Turner a plush real estate deal to keep the Hawks basketball team in the city, freeing up the NBA team to pay more than half the arena's actual construction cost. Hawks' owner Turner Broadcasting Co. was given 10 years to add development to the public land the arena was built on, with streets, roads, sidewalks and other needed infrastructure paid for with tax money. In Los Angeles, the city condemned most of about 30 acres surrounding the privately developed Staples Center for a hotel, restaurants and an entertainment district. \"The subsidies take all kinds of forms,\" said Robert Baade, an economics professor at Lake Forest College in Illinois. \"The cities and teams have become much more clever about how they finance these things and hide the public subsidies.\" Monday: Who would pay, who would benefit from a new arena.Graph: 1.

Oct. 18, 2000, 111:25PMHouston ChronicleBusinesses feel strains of political 'shakedown' By KAREN MASTERSON Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau WASHINGTON --- Business executives are being tapped for record amounts of money to support political campaigns and are tired of what one calls the \"shakedown\" by candidates and their parties, according to two studies released Wednesday. Nearly $256 million has been raised in so-called soft money --- unlimited contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals to political action committees. That figure is five times the amount of soft money raised in the presidential election year of 19992, according to the Federal Election Commission. A poll of businesses released Wednesday shows that the pressure put on corporate executives to make large contributions is creating a backlash that could lead to reform next year in Congress. The study reveals that 75 percent of corporate heads feel pressure to give; half said they fear repercussions if they turn down requests for money; and, consequently, 60 percent support a ban on soft money. Overall contributions --- for spending on both campaigns and issue ads --- have surpassed those made during the 19996 campaigns for president, the House and the Senate by $430 million. This election cycle's total, now at $1.6 billion, reflects contributions made in the 18 months leading up to June 30. Those against the influence of money on politics worry most that much more is to come. Their estimates put total campaign contributions up to $3 billion --- more than the total budget of many small countries --- once the remaining months of this year are accounted for. \"Even before this election season began, we knew that the 2000 election was going to be one for the record books,\" said Larry Makinson, executive director of Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that watches campaign contributions and their influence on policy. A lot is at stake this year, including the White House and control of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority. Democrats also hope to recover at least a few seats in the Senate. The center's analysis of FEC records shows that the computer industry leaped from a rank of 555 in campaign giving in 19990 to eighth place this year, providing $25 million in nearly equal amounts to Democrats and Republicans. \"By splitting their money, the industry has gotten just about everything it's asked for from Congress,\" Makinson said. Among those requests are a moratorium on an Internet sales tax and an increase in immigration visas for high-tech job applicants. Efforts to ban soft money have been made on Capitol Hill, but have gone nowhere. And the two presidential candidates who made a soft-money ban central to their campaigns --- Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J. --- lost their primary election bids. Advocates of a total ban hope the business survey means executives are ready to act against the status quo. \"I remember $5,000 and $10,000 contributions in soft money,\" said Harry Freeman, a former executive vice president of American Express Co., a position he held until 19990. Now he said executives are asked for $1000,000 and $2000,000. And some executives see the practice as anti-competitive, Freeman said, because significant resources are going into political campaigns instead of being reinvested in a company's ability to compete in the marketplace. \"Some are fascinated by politicians and think it's a big ideological thing to contribute. But the poll shows most people see it as a shakedown,\" said Freeman, who is currently a trustee of the Committee for Economic Development, a pro-business public policy institute that favors campaign finance overhaul and is supported by officials at Hasbro, Genesco, PP&amp;L Inc. and other companies. The center commissioned the business survey, which included a random sample of 3000 corporate executives. Soft money allows politicians and political committees to ask for huge sums of money, way beyond the limits placed on so-called hard money, which is capped and controlled by the Federal Election Commission. Because of soft money, \"the message to donors is forget the limits,\" Makinson said Wednesday at a Center for Responsive Politics news conference. He said the ballooning of campaign contributions is backed by a recent federal court order that found the FEC limits on issue-ad spending were applicable if the advertisement blatantly promoted one candidate and included the term \"vote for ... \" But Makinson said only 3 percent of television ads fall into that narrowly defined category. This is a \"messy area\" that Congress sooner or later will have to deal with, he said. Both hard and soft money raised for the presidential campaign, including individual and party contributions, is up 45 percent, from $230.9 million in 19996 to $3335.1 million in 2000. Congressional campaign contributions have increased 45 percent in the same time period, from $271.8 million to $393 million. And Senate campaigns have gone up 64 percent, from $158 million to $259.7 million, mainly because of hugely expensive races in New York and New Jersey. Texans alone gave more than $71 million in campaign contributions, with 73 percent going to Republicans. Texas ranks fourth in campaign contributions, behind California, New York and the District of Columbia, according to the center's analysis. Among those to make the center's list of top 50 individual donors is Houstonian Kenneth Lay, who runs Enron and is a longtime supporter and family friend of former President George Bush. He gave more than $361,000, almost exclusively to Republicans. Sam Wyly, another Texan, gave Republicans more than $327,000. He is an investor who ran a special interest group that criticized McCain during the primaries. Two Texas congressmen raised among the largest pools of money for use in boosting other candidates' campaigns. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, distributed $640,462. House Majority Leader Dick Armey,R-Irving, gave away $521,0999, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.   Oct. 18, 2000, 111:28PMRenaming the Dome? Rely on it By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Reliant Energy is expected to pay about $3000 million to splash its name across the new football stadium and Astrodome complex, by far the most ever for a sports facility's name. Although negotiators said Wednesday that the naming rights agreement was not yet signed, they said talks were \"feverish\" and that a formal announcement is likely next week. Under the proposed agreement, outlined by sources close to the talks, Reliant would pay about $9 million a year to name the $367 million football stadium being built for the Houston Texans. The energy company would pay an additional $750,000 to secure naming rights for the entire Astrodome complex, including the Dome, the AstroArena and a new exposition center. The deal, expected to include a stadium suite for Reliant, extensive advertising throughout the facility and rides on the team plane for company executives, would run for 30 years. Reliant's bid comes the same year that Enron Field opened in downtown Houston bearing the name of a chief local competitor, Enron Corp. Both energy utilities have eyed naming rights as valuable promotional tools to boost their profiles as electricity deregulation looms in Texas and around the country. The Reliant deal also comes on the heels of an 111 percent rate increase by the company's HL&amp;P unit in August and a proposed 111 percent increase by December to offset rising fuel costs. If signed, the agreement would be the most lucrative naming rights deal ever, both in total dollars and number of years. About a year ago, FedEx agreed to pay $205 million over 27 years to name the Washington Redskins' football stadium, the largest deal to date in total dollars. And in February 1999, Royal Philips Electronics agreed to pay about $9 million a year for 20 years to name the home of the Atlanta Hawks basketball team and Thrashers hockey team --- the largest annual sum to date. Officials with the Houston Texans, owned by Bob McNair, steadfastly denied a deal had been signed. \"A deal is not in place. We continue to have discussions,\" said Jamey Rootes, senior vice president of marketing for the Texans. However, another team source --- speaking on condition of anonymity --- confirmed that the $10 million annual figure was accurate and that Reliant had beat out Dynegy, whose chairman, Chuck Watson, owns a minority share of the football team. The Houston stadium is particularly valuable because of its rodeo ties and the likelihood it will host multiple Super Bowls, said Jeff Knapple, president and chief executive officer of Envision, a Los Angeles-based consulting company. Houston is all but guaranteed to host the 20004 Super Bowl. The Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo draws 2 million visitors a year, and the name of a stadium hosting a Super Bowl is heard by an estimated 1 billion people around the world on Super Bowl Sunday. As part of the stadium financing deal, the Texans will receive 83 percent of the money paid for the stadium's naming rights, with the facility's other main tenant, the rodeo, receiving 12 percent. Harris County, which owns the Astrodome complex, will receive the remaining 5 percent of the stadium naming rights fee, and all of the $750,000 yearly payment for the rights to the rest of the complex. If Reliant is chosen, the county also would receive $4000,000 a year for giving the energy company the exclusive right to provide power. The football stadium is scheduled to open in August 20002, at which time the Astrodome would have no tenants. Although Harris County Judge Robert Eckels has ruled out tearing down the Dome, the county has not decided what to do with the building. Although the naming rights deal encompasses the Astrodome and AstroArena, the rights to those buildings could be resold if they are refurbished for different purposes, two county sources said. If the county were to build a new arena at the complex, Reliant would be given the first option to bid on the name. It was only three years ago that Compaq Computer Corp. scored what now appears a bargain, spending $5.4 million to rename The Summit for eight years. Since then the value of naming rights has skyrocketed as dotcoms, technology companies, insurance vendors and utilities have scrambled to achieve name recognition in an increasingly cluttered media world. Only a couple of years after Compaq's deal, Enron paid $1000 million over 30 years to name the downtown ballpark. During negotiations with the Houston Rockets to build a downtown arena earlier this year, the city also sought to cash in on the escalating value of naming rights. If voters approved the agreement Nov. 7, the city would receive 5 percent of the arena's naming rights, to be capped at $2000,000 a year.   Enron Considering India Oil, Gas Assets Sale10/19/2000Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)SINGAPORE -(Dow Jones)- Enron India, a unit of U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE)., is considering selling its oil and gas assets in the country, a spokesman for the company said Thursday. Enron India operates three offshore oil and gas fields in a joint venture with Oil &amp; Natural Gas Co. (P.ONG) and Reliance Petroleum Ltd. (R.RPT). The Tapti, Panna and Mukta fields are located off the coast of Gujerat and Maharastra.It holds a 30% stake in each field, while ONGC and Reliance hold 40% and 30% stakes respectively. \"Enron India is considering the sale of these oil and gas fields,\" said the spokesman. He declined to say how soon the company would arrive at a decision. He stressed that there would be no disruptions in the operations while the company was mulling the sale. He added that there would also be no disruptions in the runup to any withdrawal should the company opt to sell their stakes in the fields. A spokesman for JV partner ONGC said the company would be keen to buy Enron's stake if it went up for sale. \"Our company will take a look at it. There's no reason why ONGC shouldn't be keen,\" he said. Analysts said Enron may be seeking to divest its oil and gas assets to focus instead on \"new economy\" sectors such as telecommunications. \"This could be a reshuffle as to where they focus their exposure. There's a big push in the telecom space,\" said a Hong Kong-based oil and gas analyst with an international merchant bank. The analyst said Enron's possible divestment of its oil and gas assets wasn't overly negative for India's foreign investment program. \"Oil companies are always pruning and tweaking their portfolios even in core areas. This isn't the beginning of the end of Enron's participation in India,\" he said. Sanjeev Prasad, an oil and gas research analyst, with Bombay-based Kotak Securities, said Enron India's proposal to shed its oil and gas operation was indicative of a broader plan by parent company, Enron Corp., to slim down its global operations. \"Globally, they have been doing it (divesting itself of global assets), and I am not too surprised they have done it here,\" Prasad said. If Enron India did proceed with its oil and gas sale, Prasad didn't expect it to have any major repercussions in the energy sector as a whole. \"It (Enron) doesn't have much exposure in oil and gas in India,\" he said. He added that Reliance Petroleum could emerge as a likely buyer of Enron's stake. \"They're very likely candidates,\" he said. The Hong Kong-based analyst also said Reliance Petroleum could emerge as a prospective buyer if Enron sold its oil and gas stake. Reliance Petroleum officials were unavailable for comment when contacted by Dow Jones Newswires. Current production in Enron India's three west coast offshore fields is approximately 290 million cubic feet a day of gas and 25,5000 barrels a day of oil. Enron's oil, gas and power holdings in India are estimated to be worth around US$3 billion. The company's Dabhol power project, due to be completed in the fourth quarter of 20001, will generate 2,184 megawatts of power to become the world's largest independent natural gas-fired power plant. Enron closed the US$1.87 billion financing of the second phase of the Dabhol project in May 1999. The financing includes a liquefied natural gas terminal and regasification plant, allowing India to import natural gas for the first time. Enron contracts to purchase 2.1 million tons of LNG from Oman and Abu Dhabi to supply Dabhol when the second phase is completed end-20001. -By Sri Jegarajah, Dow Jones Newswires; 65-421-4831; sri.jegarajah@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Former Minn. Legislator Eyes Huge Wind Project In PlainsBy Jon KampOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/19/2000Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Minnesota farmer Jim Nichols has a healthy soybean and corn crop this year. But it never hurts to have a little business on the side, or big ideas. So Nichols, a former Minnesota legislator, is trying to set up a 3,000-megawatt, $7 billion wind power project in South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota.\"This is a giant step forward,\" Nichols said. \"This one project more than doubles all the wind power in the country now.\" Few U.S. companies truly sell wind power competitively. But with natural gas prices soaring and environmental laws becoming tougher, the renewable energy source is poised to become a real option for developers, Nichols said. You just have to build on the right scale. Nichols' project, expected to be completed in 20006, is truly enormous. It would require 2,000 wind turbines, priced at about $1 million each. The turbines would stretch for 5000 miles across three states and generate close to half the power of the Grand Coulee Dam. Nichols is planning to develop the wind farms with Clipper LLC, a recently formed Santa Barbara, Calif.-based wind development firm. Nichols and Ken Hach, Clipper's new project developer and a former employee of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) wind development unit, hope to support the project by inking long-term power contracts with Midwestern utilities like Chicago's Commonwealth Edison Co. The wind project isn't Nichols' first foray into the wind business. In 19994, he helped broker a deal that requires Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy Inc. (XEL) to buy 425 megawatts of wind power by 20002 in exchange for permission to build new storage space for spent nuclear fuel. This new project, however, is considerably more complex and faces plenty of potential stumbling blocks. First is the massive price tag. \"The problem with this concept is you're asking big bucks,\" said Linda Byus, a utilities analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Bensen in Chicago. Land will have to be acquired to site the turbines. And new transmission lines will have to be strung, something few utilities have been able to accomplish on any scale in recent years. In addition - brace yourselves, environmentalists - the project isn't entirely green. Since wind turbines can only be expected to turn about a third of the time, Nichols and Hach will have to line up a backup source of power to ensure that the long-term supply contracts they sign with utilities don't go unfulfilled. Although the developers could look to existing plants in the region, the back-up they're eying is new coal. According to Nichols, some coal companies in Wyoming are ready and willing to build six 5000-megawatt plants to support the wind power contracts. Northern Plains A Welcome Site On the plus side, natural gas prices have soared to record highs, and many companies are looking for ways to soften their dependence on the fuel and its volatile wholesale markets, said John Dunlop, regional manager for the American Wind Energy Association. \"There's a huge load that people are salivating to satisfy,\" he said. The northern Plains - flat, sparsely populated and home to steady winds - is the place to build. The industry, said Bob Gates, senior vice president of Enron Wind, calls the region \"the Saudi Arabia of wind.\" South Dakota, at least, is actively soliciting developers of wind power. South Dakota Public Utilities Commission Chairman Jim Burg, who is hosting a meeting on the state's wind-power prospects Wednesday and Thursday, said many communities are vying for the chance to host wind-power projects. Fees provide some incentive - landowners may be offered 2% of the sale price of power generated on their land - as does the prospect of adding hundreds of new jobs. \"I have a hard time not being a major proponent,\" Burg said. \"We haven't had that kind of economic impact for a long time.\" Florida's FPL Group, (FPL), the largest wind-power operator in the U.S., is already looking at acquiring land in South Dakota, Burg said. \"We definitely see (South Dakota) as a place to be in the future,\" said FPL spokeswoman Cathy Scott. Enron is also interested in the northern Plains. \"We've done some development work in the area,\" Gates said. \"And we've been talking with Clipper and other developers on a variety of projects in the area.\" Gates, citing confidentiality agreements, declined to comment on whether the company is directly involved in Nichols' projects. But he did say Enron has worked with Nichols before and has the capability to develop every aspect of a wind generating project. Hach, while acknowledging the difficulties of raising financing for wind projects, said funds could probably be found. \"The level of interest on Wall Street is probably not as high as it should be,\" he said. But, \"If the economics work, the financing will come.\" -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Indeed, as a group, the companies received $535 million in credits or refunds, the report found. The study of 250 large publicly traded companies showed that 24 owed no tax or received credits against past or future tax obligations in 19998, up from 13 in 19997 and 16 in 19996. The study also found that 71 of the 250 companies paid taxes at less than half the official 35 percent corporate rate during the three-year period. The study was conducted by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington research organization associated with Citizens for Tax Justice, a nonprofit group supported in part by labor unions. The group argues that the tax system favors the rich and politically connected. Corporate profits overall soared 23.5 percent during the three-year period, but corporate tax revenues grew just 7.7 percent, a disjunction that has drawn intense interest from the Treasury Department and some members of Congress who are concerned about the growing market for tax shelters and their abuse. In recent years, Congress has watered down the 1986 overhaul of the tax laws, which lowered rates and eliminated most tax shelters, and was supposed to simplify reporting. The recent changes have opened fresh opportunities for corporations to cut their taxes, the study found. '''Corporate taxes are not rising along with profits because companies have found all sorts of ways to get around the reforms in the 1986 tax act,''' said Robert S. McIntyre, the director of Citizens for Tax Justice. '''Companies also have gotten a lot of help from Congress, especially in gutting the minimum tax rules.''' Mr. McIntyre said that he and T. D. Coo Nguyen, the co-author, spent more than two years examining financial statements the companies sent to shareholders. All but 18 of the companies studied are on the Fortune 5000 list, and the others are in the Fortune 1000. He said companies were excluded if they lost money or their tax disclosures '''were crafted so that you could not figure them out.''' At least two companies objected to the study's methodology. Keith Price, a spokesman for Goodyear, said the study did not appear to consider an accounting rule affecting its sale of a pipeline subsidiary in 19998. It made no objection to the 19996 and 19997 figures. Michael N. Ambler, Texaco's chief tax counsel, said that his company had tax disputes with the Internal Revenue Service that were unresolved after more than a decade. If those disputes are settled with a refund, he said, that can easily distort the figures for any one year. He said that even the three-year study period was too short to give an accurate picture. Timothy McCormally of the Tax Executives Institute, which represents officials at large companies, told Bloomberg News that the companies named in the report did nothing wrong. '''There is nothing in the report that suggests that any of this results from any illegal or improper activity,''' he said. The study by the Washington institute showed that the corporate tax burden was falling in many cases because of the growing use of stock options, which are an expense for tax purposes but do not count against profits reported to shareholders. Recent annual reports filed by Microsoft and Cisco Systems indicate that they paid no federal income taxes in 1999 because stock options exercised by employees wiped out profits for tax purposes. The study found that General Electric, I.B.M., Pfizer, Intel and Bristol-Myers Squibb also sharply reduced their tax rates because of stock options without having to show reduced earnings to shareholders. The most significant factor in the easing corporate tax burden, Mr. McIntyre said, can be traced to actions in Congress, which relaxed the corporate minimum tax in 19993 when the Democrats were in control of both the House and Senate, and again in 19997, after the Republicans had taken over. Congress made it easier for corporations to spread tax breaks and profits over many years, including reaching back to past years to get tax breaks that could not be used at the time. In at least one of the three years studied, 41 of the 250 large companies studied paid no federal income tax. Those 41 companies reported $25.8 billion in profits to shareholders in the years they paid no taxes. If they had been obligated to pay the full 35 percent corporate rate, the tax bill would have been $9 billion, but the companies received $3.2 billion in refunds. In total dollars, General Electric was the biggest beneficiary of tax breaks, the study said, saving $6.9 billion in three years. The company paid $2.1 billion in income taxes on $25.8 billion in profits, for a tax rate of 8.1 percent. The highest tax rate for the three years was paid by Winn-Dixie Stores, which paid an average of 35.7 percent of its 19996 through 19998 profits in federal income taxes.

Business; Financial Desk Legal Breaks Lower Some Corporate Tax Rates ? 10/20/2000 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-3 Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON --- Dozens of America's most profitable companies enjoyed tax-free years during the 19990s largely because of legal tax breaks, an independent study released Thursday found. The report by the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 250 companies paid an effective tax rate of 20.1% in 19998, down from 222.9% just two years before. The federal income tax rate for corporations is supposed to be 35%. Of the 250 companies studied, 41 enjoyed at least one year of no income taxes or an actual rebate from the federal government, despite pretax profits of $25.8 billion from 19996 to 19998. If all 250 companies had paid the full 35% on $735 billion in pretax profits, the study estimated the total income tax would have come to $257 billion. But tax breaks put into law by Congress lowered those companies' tax bills by $98 billion over the three-year period. Companies getting tax rebates in 19998 alone included Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp., PepsiCo Inc., J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Enron Corp. and General Motors Corp., the report found. The study's chief author, Robert S. McIntyre, said companies lower their taxes through such breaks as depreciation write-offs, tax credits for research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise stock options. The report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate from 19996 to 19998, at 12.3%, followed by electronics at 13.1%, forest and paper products at 13.9% and transportation at 14%. At the other end of the spectrum, publishing and printing companies paid 31.6%, gas and electric utilities paid 28.1% and retail and wholesale trade companies paid 27.6%.

Oct. 19, 2000, 10:23PMHouston ChronicleArena boosters tout 3 benefits Some question property/sales tax numbers, new development By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Enron Field sparked the redevelopment of downtown's east side, boosters say, and an arena would crown the revitalization of the long-neglected area. A strongly pro-arena business organization, Central Houston Inc., released a flurry of positive economic numbers to back its contention that Enron Field is a boon to downtown as well as to city, county and school tax coffers, and that the arena would be as well. \"There's no better way to measure the impact of sports facilities on downtown than to look at the one we already have,\" said the organization's president, Bob Eury, as he crooked a finger toward the ballpark. Eury and other boosters outlined three economic benefits to Houston they say are related to sports facilities: increased property tax revenues, a wealth of new development in the area and a boost in sales tax collected. But economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions. When Enron Field was built, nine blocks were taken off the tax rolls at a cost of about $284,000 in lost property taxes. Eury said, though, that it was not a bad trade. He noted that properties around the ballpark have leaped in value since the Enron Field project began in the mid-19990s. In turn, the annual property tax collected on land and buildings within four blocks of the ballpark is $2.4 million greater now than in 19995. But Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt said those figures are due in part to the boom in land values across downtown, including the central business district, since 19995. Bettencourt said he hoped to have an analysis finished today to determine whether land values around Enron Field had increased at a greater rate than land in the rest of downtown. The boosters also highlighted more than $7000 million worth of private developments planned --- but not yet completed --- near the ballpark, including the $90 million, 37-story Ballpark Place Tower across Crawford Street from Enron Field. \"Without a doubt, if Enron Field was not there, Ballpark Place would not be there,\" said John Holland, an executive vice president for the Trammel Crow Co., which expects to break ground on the project in early 20001. Because the arena would be built in an urban core, even academics who are skeptical about the economic benefits of sports stadiums agreed that spin-off development is likely nearby. But independent economists who have studied such issues, including Brad Humphreys, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, say development near a stadium usually has a negative impact on development and businesses in other parts of a city. The focus must be on the entire market, Humphreys said, not just in the vicinity of a sports facility. \"Public subsidization of stadiums and arenas isn't necessarily a bad thing,\" he said. \"But when they sell them as economic engines, it's just absolutely wrong. The research doesn't show that.\" A recent study Humphreys co-authored, which appeared in the fall 1999 issue of the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, found that the presence of professional sports teams in a market, on average, actually reduced the per-capita income in those markets, compared with similar markets without such teams. Given Houston's strong economy, Eury said he does not believe downtown development will detract from other areas of the city, as Humphreys' studies have shown in other markets. A third major economic benefit offered Thursday was that a new arena, with the Houston Rockets and Houston Comets as tenants, would generate $13 million a year in sales tax revenues. About $2.7 million of that would go into local coffers, with the remainder going to the state, according to the study performed for Eury's group by CSL International, a consulting firm. Yet even in the absence of a new arena and both teams, many economists say a large portion of those expenditures would be spent in the area anyway. That is known as a \"substitution effect.\" Instead of a family going to a game, it might go to the movies or local zoo. And corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their advertising budgets, the economists say. The CSL study did not account for this substitution effect in calculating the sales tax impact, said Bill Rhoda, the firm's director.   Study: Dozens of corporations pay little or no income taxBy CURT ANDERSONAP Tax Writer10/19/2000Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2000. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - Dozens of America's most profitable companies enjoyed tax-free years during the 19990s largely because of legal tax breaks, an independent study released Thursday found.

At the other end of the spectrum, publishing and printing companies paid 31.6 percent, gas and electric utilities paid 28.1 percent and retail and wholesale trade companies paid 27.6 percent. \"Anyone who worries about our economy's long-term growth has to wonder why the tax code is being used to favor some industries and some kinds of investments over others, rather than letting market forces decide,\" McIntyre said. --- On the Net: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy site: http:///www.itepnet.orgCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

US Rep Drafts Bill To Impose Windfall Tax On Pwr Companies.By JASON LEOPOLD10/19/2000Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's summer of soaring wholesale electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in the third quarter.But if U.S. Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif., gets his way, those companies will be forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities, customers and the government. Filner introduced a bill in the House of Representatives last week that would impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western U.S. The bill, which was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, may be discussed in December or January, according to Filner, and if he gets enough support by the mostly Republican caucus, companies like Enron Corp. (ENE), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Co. (SO). Reliant Energy (REI) and Dynegy (DYN), would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and anything over that amount would be taxed 1000%. Filner said the amount of profit hasn't been determined but his bill calls for a baseline that would be a \"just and reasonable\" amount of profit. The congressman's San Diego constituents were paying market-based electricity rates in the summer which resulted in triple-digit utility bills. He said generators are gouging California customers and need to be held responsible. \"This is not just a problem of supply and demand,\" Filner told Dow Jones Newswires. \"This is stealing. And we want our money back.\" State and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into California's wholesale power crisis. The findings, expected to be complete in about two weeks, are aimed at determining if generators or other key players manipulated the state's wholesale energy market. At least two major energy companies are being investigated by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer. A high level source working on the probe with the Attorney General said third-quarter earnings statements will play a major role in finding out if generators manipulated the market. Their investigation isn't turning up much evidence but earnings statements are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices in California, the source said. At least one Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the wholesale electricity market in California will be in for a \"rude awakening\" when the agency completes its investigation. \"There will be some serious structural changes to the market,\" the commissioner said. Representatives from energy companies told Dow Jones Newswires that higher profits weren't the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market. Energy Cos. Say Summer Crisis Boosted 3Q Earnings On Wednesday, Duke Energy, which owns and operates power plants in California, said in an earnings statement that third-quarter profit rose 74%, due in part, to high wholesale prices in California in the summer. Enron and several other companies reported similar third-quarter increases based on California's summer of skyrocketing power prices. The congressman doesn't want to limit the proposed windfall tax to California, but where generators sell power in the western U.S. But even Filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their profits isn't getting the early support it needs to become law. \"If the democrats were in charge I'd have this bill voted on already,\" Filner said. Filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to consumers and utilities, the victims, as he refers to them. Meanwhile, he's also working on getting the House to pass a separate bill to roll back electricity rates in the western U.S. to pre-deregulation levels and he's trying to gather support for a wind power initiative. Regardless of the outcome, the congressman is dead set on making noise. \"If nothing happens, I'm thinking about holding a press conference with the San Diego District Attorney,\" he said. \"We'll press criminal charges against the energy companies.\" -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Business; Financial Desk Legal Breaks Lower Some Corporate Tax Rates ? 10/20/2000 Los Angeles Times Home Edition Page C-3 Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON --- Dozens of America's most profitable companies enjoyed tax-free years during the 19990s largely because of legal tax breaks, an independent study released Thursday found. The report by the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that 250 companies paid an effective tax rate of 20.1% in 19998, down from 222.9% just two years before. The federal income tax rate for corporations is supposed to be 35%. Of the 250 companies studied, 41 enjoyed at least one year of no income taxes or an actual rebate from the federal government, despite pretax profits of $25.8 billion from 19996 to 19998. If all 250 companies had paid the full 35% on $735 billion in pretax profits, the study estimated the total income tax would have come to $257 billion. But tax breaks put into law by Congress lowered those companies' tax bills by $98 billion over the three-year period. Companies getting tax rebates in 19998 alone included Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp., PepsiCo Inc., J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., Enron Corp. and General Motors Corp., the report found. The study's chief author, Robert S. McIntyre, said companies lower their taxes through such breaks as depreciation write-offs, tax credits for research and development and deductions they take when employees exercise stock options. The report also found that the petroleum industry paid the lowest tax rate from 19996 to 19998, at 12.3%, followed by electronics at 13.1%, forest and paper products at 13.9% and transportation at 14%. At the other end of the spectrum, publishing and printing companies paid 31.6%, gas and electric utilities paid 28.1% and retail and wholesale trade companies paid 27.6%.

Oct. 19, 2000, 10:23PMHouston ChronicleArena boosters tout 3 benefits Some question property/sales tax numbers, new development By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Enron Field sparked the redevelopment of downtown's east side, boosters say, and an arena would crown the revitalization of the long-neglected area. A strongly pro-arena business organization, Central Houston Inc., released a flurry of positive economic numbers to back its contention that Enron Field is a boon to downtown as well as to city, county and school tax coffers, and that the arena would be as well. \"There's no better way to measure the impact of sports facilities on downtown than to look at the one we already have,\" said the organization's president, Bob Eury, as he crooked a finger toward the ballpark. Eury and other boosters outlined three economic benefits to Houston they say are related to sports facilities: increased property tax revenues, a wealth of new development in the area and a boost in sales tax collected. But economic analysts questioned some of their conclusions. When Enron Field was built, nine blocks were taken off the tax rolls at a cost of about $284,000 in lost property taxes. Eury said, though, that it was not a bad trade. He noted that properties around the ballpark have leaped in value since the Enron Field project began in the mid-19990s. In turn, the annual property tax collected on land and buildings within four blocks of the ballpark is $2.4 million greater now than in 19995. But Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector Paul Bettencourt said those figures are due in part to the boom in land values across downtown, including the central business district, since 19995. Bettencourt said he hoped to have an analysis finished today to determine whether land values around Enron Field had increased at a greater rate than land in the rest of downtown. The boosters also highlighted more than $7000 million worth of private developments planned --- but not yet completed --- near the ballpark, including the $90 million, 37-story Ballpark Place Tower across Crawford Street from Enron Field. \"Without a doubt, if Enron Field was not there, Ballpark Place would not be there,\" said John Holland, an executive vice president for the Trammel Crow Co., which expects to break ground on the project in early 20001. Because the arena would be built in an urban core, even academics who are skeptical about the economic benefits of sports stadiums agreed that spin-off development is likely nearby. But independent economists who have studied such issues, including Brad Humphreys, an assistant professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, say development near a stadium usually has a negative impact on development and businesses in other parts of a city. The focus must be on the entire market, Humphreys said, not just in the vicinity of a sports facility. \"Public subsidization of stadiums and arenas isn't necessarily a bad thing,\" he said. \"But when they sell them as economic engines, it's just absolutely wrong. The research doesn't show that.\" A recent study Humphreys co-authored, which appeared in the fall 1999 issue of the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, found that the presence of professional sports teams in a market, on average, actually reduced the per-capita income in those markets, compared with similar markets without such teams. Given Houston's strong economy, Eury said he does not believe downtown development will detract from other areas of the city, as Humphreys' studies have shown in other markets. A third major economic benefit offered Thursday was that a new arena, with the Houston Rockets and Houston Comets as tenants, would generate $13 million a year in sales tax revenues. About $2.7 million of that would go into local coffers, with the remainder going to the state, according to the study performed for Eury's group by CSL International, a consulting firm. Yet even in the absence of a new arena and both teams, many economists say a large portion of those expenditures would be spent in the area anyway. That is known as a \"substitution effect.\" Instead of a family going to a game, it might go to the movies or local zoo. And corporations are likely to sponsor other local events out of their advertising budgets, the economists say. The CSL study did not account for this substitution effect in calculating the sales tax impact, said Bill Rhoda, the firm's director.

US Rep Drafts Bill To Impose Windfall Tax On Pwr Companies.By JASON LEOPOLD10/19/2000Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California's summer of soaring wholesale electricity prices helped boost the stock price of many energy companies in the third quarter.But if U.S. Rep. Bob Filner, D-Calif., gets his way, those companies will be forced to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars in profit to utilities, customers and the government. Filner introduced a bill in the House of Representatives last week that would impose a windfall profit tax on wholesale power sold throughout the western U.S. The bill, which was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, may be discussed in December or January, according to Filner, and if he gets enough support by the mostly Republican caucus, companies like Enron Corp. (ENE), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Co. (SO). Reliant Energy (REI) and Dynegy (DYN), would only be allowed to show a certain amount of profit and anything over that amount would be taxed 1000%. Filner said the amount of profit hasn't been determined but his bill calls for a baseline that would be a \"just and reasonable\" amount of profit. The congressman's San Diego constituents were paying market-based electricity rates in the summer which resulted in triple-digit utility bills. He said generators are gouging California customers and need to be held responsible. \"This is not just a problem of supply and demand,\" Filner told Dow Jones Newswires. \"This is stealing. And we want our money back.\" State and federal regulators are conducting separate investigations into California's wholesale power crisis. The findings, expected to be complete in about two weeks, are aimed at determining if generators or other key players manipulated the state's wholesale energy market. At least two major energy companies are being investigated by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer. A high level source working on the probe with the Attorney General said third-quarter earnings statements will play a major role in finding out if generators manipulated the market. Their investigation isn't turning up much evidence but earnings statements are showing that profits are up significantly largely due to wholesale prices in California, the source said. At least one Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the wholesale electricity market in California will be in for a \"rude awakening\" when the agency completes its investigation. \"There will be some serious structural changes to the market,\" the commissioner said. Representatives from energy companies told Dow Jones Newswires that higher profits weren't the result of illegal activity or manipulating the market. Energy Cos. Say Summer Crisis Boosted 3Q Earnings On Wednesday, Duke Energy, which owns and operates power plants in California, said in an earnings statement that third-quarter profit rose 74%, due in part, to high wholesale prices in California in the summer. Enron and several other companies reported similar third-quarter increases based on California's summer of skyrocketing power prices. The congressman doesn't want to limit the proposed windfall tax to California, but where generators sell power in the western U.S. But even Filner admits that forcing generators to refund part of their profits isn't getting the early support it needs to become law. \"If the democrats were in charge I'd have this bill voted on already,\" Filner said. Filner said if the bill is passed some of the money would be refunded to consumers and utilities, the victims, as he refers to them. Meanwhile, he's also working on getting the House to pass a separate bill to roll back electricity rates in the western U.S. to pre-deregulation levels and he's trying to gather support for a wind power initiative. Regardless of the outcome, the congressman is dead set on making noise. \"If nothing happens, I'm thinking about holding a press conference with the San Diego District Attorney,\" he said. \"We'll press criminal charges against the energy companies.\" -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Phillips and Laura HeinauerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal03/07/20001The Wall Street JournalA2(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)WASHINGTON --- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.\"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,\" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 1000,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. \"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of this,\" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government relations. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 19997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. \"We'll be circulating them very broadly,\" Mr. Rice said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $5000,000 --- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials --- those of a libertarian persuasion --- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. \"That makes it a much more serious issue,\" Mr. Rice said. \"We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.\" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. \"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,\" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate BeneficiariesTop 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance forfiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millionsBoeing $3,3335Bechtel Group $1,075Distributed Processing Systems $3888Willbros Group $387United Technologies $3334Raytheon $156General Electric $150Halliburton $136Enron $135LSI Logic $120Source: Ex-Im BankCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish ReformsBy Germana CanziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES03/07/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 1000,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 20001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 20001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +444 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 19997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. Copyright &amp;copy; 20001 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Deal with state could take until 20002 to closeBy LESLIE GORNSTEINAP Business Writer03/06/20001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 20001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 20002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&amp;E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&amp;E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, \"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later.\" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&amp;E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. \"Trust me,\" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. \"There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare.\" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&amp;E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&amp;E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report03/06/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun reported Tuesday. The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report.A $3111 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. \"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,\" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently. Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and South, respectively. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 07/03/01 01-04GCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not FinalBy Jason Leopold03/06/20001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES --- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. \"This is not a done deal,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday --- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) --- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $4000 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. \"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,8000 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&amp;E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. --- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas03/06/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders said. Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.Some storage buying occurred in Texas \"if they could make it work,\" a trader said. \"It was a pretty uneventful day,\" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$333 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&amp;E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather. Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a range of $5.25-$5.30/MMMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar range of $5.26-$5.35/MMMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMMBtu. -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

The purchase price is $5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as the NNG system. \"Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin,\" said Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern Natural Gas. \"This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved.\" \"We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market,\" said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. \"The purchase of the Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers.\" As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the current Northern Natural pipeline. \"This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers,\" said George Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. \"The Eagle line purchase by Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace.\" The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the construction of Guardian Pipeline. Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock RiseBy Mark Long and Steve McGrathOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES07/13/20001Dow Jones Commodities Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from Thursday's late kerb close at $1,5554.50 a metric ton.An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-month high of 5550,3000 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to test $1,5550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in later trade. Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract will switch over to cash Monday. Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. The opposite situation is called contango. \"The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated,\" said Kevin Norrish, an analyst with Barclays Capital in London. Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. \"Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,\" Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he added. European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, brokers said. However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, they said. On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing countries are also expected to fall. Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and dollar-denominated grains on the world market. -By Mark Long and Steve McGrath, Dow Jones Newswires; 444-20-7842-9358; mark.long@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. \"The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise,\" said Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to significantly improve market sentiment. \"A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being,\" Barclays said in a market report. Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on technicals. Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,9000/ton support but still closed at its lowest level since April. Nickel's fall was \"just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, mostly chart-based,\" Bhar said. -By Mark Long, Dow Jones Newswires; +444-20-7842-9356; mark.long@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 1000 rally, Vodafone leads.By Camila Reed07/13/20001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 20001.LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from Wednesday's 16-week low. Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 555-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p.The FTSE 1000 finished 555.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having jumped 1.666 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, having streaked up in the previous session. Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying opportunity for UK equities. DRUGS SEE-SAW Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over one percent. Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 1000 top ten gainers with a three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical play. Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by four points. FTSE MIXED PICTURE But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a lapse in consumer confidence. \"This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile but it does show the potential of the market,\" said Foreign &amp; Colonial director of UK equities David Manning. \"It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the temptation is to do very little,\" he said. ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. TECHS DIP Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 2223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent jump. The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It initially rallied 222 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper deal to combine the companies. The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 444 pence a share.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)20001-07-13 08:48 (New York)Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)   (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph ofstory that moved yesterday.)   New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) --- The New York MercantileExchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfurcoal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a majorrole in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.   The contract's debut came after prices for coal, consideredthe dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, asdemand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal forSeptember delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.   ```We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,''' saidAndy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s sixcoal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ```Thiscontract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure''' to largeprice swings.   The Bush administration said in an energy policy report thisspring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricitygeneration through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel whenhe retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxideemissions, implicated in global warming.   Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation'scarbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, whichcauses acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.   The Nymex started the futures contract to give miningcompanies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $333billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. andArch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, havesaid they would trade the futures.   New Plants   Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas --- acleaner-burning power-plant fuel --- prompted many generators toramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpilesdwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since atleast 1989.   So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announcedplans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-based Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-basedPacifiCorp.   Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation'selectricity, few plants were built during the 19990s because of thehigh costs of building them and the difficulty of complying withfederal and local environmental regulations.   Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normaltemperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand forair conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six powerplants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.   ```The summer's been pretty mild so far --- you haven't seenany big heat waves''' in regions with the most coal generation, hesaid.   Big Sandy   The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,5550tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River nearHuntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loadedonto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. andpossibly Europe.   The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachianstates that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3and 4 coal producers.   The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Westernstates that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.   Avoiding the Past   The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coalfutures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started overthe past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts havefizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, whichdebuted in May 2000.   ```I said yesterday, if you traded 1000 to 2000 contracts, thatwould be a really a good day,''' said Chris Casale, vice presidentof energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal andbuys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.```It came out sort of on target.'''   Most of today's trading was originated by large energymarketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whetherDynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energytrader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utilityholding company, have said they would trade coal futures.   Exchange officials have said the coal market has thepotential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.   The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averagesabout 666,7000 trades a day, and its 111-year-old natural gascontract averages about 333,5000.   Wary of Coal   ```The coal market is still lacking liquidity,''' said AnthonyMcAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought fivecoal contracts for a client at $42 a ton --- the market's firsttransaction. ```You probably need to see a little moreparticipation''' from industry coal buyers and sellers for themarket to take off.   Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary oftrading coal futures without assurances that the industry will beactive as well.   ```Floor traders lost millions''' in electricity futures whensome were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in theindustry to sell them to, he said.   ```Because of that, people are a little bit tentative aboutcoal,''' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ```We'rehere to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.'''   \t\t\tModern Metals, July 20001   \t\t\tGiant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a \"non-event.\"\t\t\tBy MichelleMartinez Arjona,Editor-in-Chief,and Paul Hohl,Contributing Editor \t\t\tThese days, saying the word \"Enron\" in a room full of metals executives is like screaming \"fire\" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion---that's with a \"b\"), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as \"annoyances\"), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market contender. \t\t\tFriend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all---still others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious.\t\t\tWhat's the hubbub?Although products such as natural gas and energy---Enron's major business platform---have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in \"uninformed investment decisions\" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility. \t\t\tEnron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. Enron contends that it can act as a \"risk intermediary\" in steel transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year.\t\t\t\"Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel,\" McMahon stated, \"and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that.\"\t\t\tThe company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for $2225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery at $215 a ton. \t\t\tEventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June.\t\t\t\"It's a big portfolio,\" McMahon said. \"We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets---hopefully we'll own some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business.\"\t\t\tSteel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year \"physical off take\" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for now.\t\t\tNucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. \"What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and equipment,\" he stated. \"I define true value as helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility at $2000 a ton.\"\t\t\tKeith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New Steel article. \"If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], great,\" he said. \"But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your throat.\"\t\t\tFor the service centersService centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. \"The only way [distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory,\" he explained. \"That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above.\t\t\t\"We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the service centers,\" he continued, \"so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somewhat certain.\"\t\t\t\"I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . \" commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he pointed out that \"how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some people and a non-event for others.\"\t\t\tBeyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, \"One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it---as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals.\" \t\t\tIn a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in orders, but no releases, and a \"don't call us, we'll call you\" attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reductions on the way down and on the way up. \"If Enron brings integrity to both sides of this market,\" he concluded, \"that would be a very big plus for the steel industry.\"\t\t\tBut integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, \"trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we need right now,\" he declared, \"somebody trying to squeeze out a few more dollars.\" But, he recognized, \"we're all going to have to deal with it.\"\t\t\tDon McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube &amp; Iron, indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking the so-called \"low-hanging fruit\" of the steel market in the current economy. \"What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just the peripheral items?\" he queried. \"My concern would be that the price would go up on [those items].\"\t\t\tMcNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. \"In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment,\" he related. \"Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?\"\t\t\tOnly just begunQuestions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, \"are they ready to deal with problems?\"\t\t\tAlthough Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave Lerman explained, \"I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to implement.\" Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. \"Most customers require better than standard tolerances,\" he pointed out. \"These are all issues that might complicate commodity sales.\"\t\t\tDelivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, \"the guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?\"\t\t\tMill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. \"They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it to a U.S. customer,\" said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the LME, will be in hedging. \"You may see some [physical transactions] to start with,\" Bradford predicted, \"just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see that as the way the market will develop.\"\t\t\tMcMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. \"We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so,\" he said. \"It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'.\"\t\t\tThe jury is still out on just how soon that \"when\" will come, and what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don McNeeley recounted, \"I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now.\" \n"

I am currently a Development Support Manager with EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I   had the good fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.   He represents a company called IdleAire Technologies, Inc...   IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.   Their plan is to electrify truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.   Also, these units provide cable TV and internet services.   They have already piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.IdleAire's   goal is to: \"...evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television.\"Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, D.C.   Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and   Van Hilleary.   Also, former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire Technologies.   These individuals support this technology because it reduces emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.   I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what we do.   He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and the capital to invest in this project.   Enron would benefit in several ways:1.   Greater than average returns.2.   Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.   (EPA Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc...) 3.   Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.4.   Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.5.   Open a whole new market for the energy services group. (EES)   Long term maintenance contract, commodities, etc...6.   Open a new market for the broadband services group. (EBS)   Videos on demand.I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.   If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce him to you.   They have a   very comprehensive business plan that lays out their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an executive summary of the business.   You can also find out more about the company by visiting their website at:ww.idleaire.comThank you   for your time.Chad Tipton5-5310\n"

We would like to have your panel discussion on October 9, from 3:30-5:30PM.   We would like to ask that the you to put together a session that highlights topics that provide a insight from both a national and international perspective   The conference committee has chosen the One Enron theme since the attendees at the conference are coming from all the Enron business units both domestically and internationally. The estimated attendance at the conference will be 2225 Enron and Joint Venture employees.   The invitations are being issued enterprise-wide to employees who are engaged in operations/maintenance/purchasing./sourcing   This conference is the expansion of the annual plant managers' conference that is held each year in Houston.   We are replacing it with what we will be a \"Best in Class\" conference addressing multiple topics that will provide direction that will result in lower costs, increased earnings and employee retention.   We will also be utilizing this conference as an additional mentoring activity for our Minority/Women Business Enterprise suppliers.I hope that you will accept our invitation, because I know many of the participates will benefit from your panels experiences and knowledge.An agenda has been attached for your review, however it is still in development.If you have any questions, I can be reached at (713) 646-8235.

The remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe will be owned by Vivendi (34 percent), Marubeni Corp. (15 percent) and Sithe Management (1 percent). Vivendi Universal retains a blocking minority interest of 34 percent in the company and PECO Energy (which, along with Unicom, formed Exelon Corp.) becomes Sithe's main shareholder. PECO has also been given a three-year commitment starting from December 20002, to buy Vivendi Universal's remaining interest. ANALYSIS: The announcement of this acquisition was first made in August, prior to the formation of Exelon Corp. Under the original agreement dated Aug. 111, 2000, PECO Energy is purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe's North American assets, including its domestic marketing and development businesses, for $682 million. The acquisition marks a new direction for Sithe Energies and a continuation of an aggressive generation expansion plan on the part of Exelon. This divestiture by Sithe Energies signals its withdrawal from power production. Only two years ago, Sithe Energies was one of the largest independent power producers in the United States, operating 43 power plants from New Jersey to California. Sithe Energies had made a decided effort to purchase vast generation assets in the Northeastern United States, believing that there would be value in having critical mass in the deregulated generation market in that region. Until last year, Sithe Energies was the primary subsidiary of French mega-utility Vivendi, which had been creating a reputation as an industry powerhouse due to its assets in electric energy services, thermal energy supply, water distribution and wastewater management. Interestingly, Vivendi did not own a gas or electric utility anywhere in the world, and instead used Sithe Energies as the vehicle to accumulate generation assets as its primary entry into the energy industry. Indications that the company's strategy was changing began to surface earlier this year. In February, Sithe Energies sold 21 power plants to Reliant Energy for a total of $2.1 billion. The sale generated an immediate capital gain of about $450 million for Sithe Energies, indicating that its generation assets were bringing strong shareholder value for its investors, even if the company appeared to be exiting the generation market.Then, in June, Vivendi announced that it had entered into a \"strategic business combination\" with Canal and The Seagram Company Ltd to form a new company called Vivendi Universal, a communications conglomerate for wired and wireless markets owning the world's largest music company, second largest film library, major film production studio, and a PC-based software game publishing company. (Note that just yesterday Vivendi Universal entered into an agreement for the sale of Seagram's spirits and wine business to Diageo and Pernod Ricard for $8.1 billion, subject to regulatory approvals). Vivendi also continued to expand its significant water business, through its subsidiaries U.S. Filter Corporation and G,n,rale des Eaux Group which recently won water treatment contracts New Zealand and Indonesia. In a separate development, Vivendi, supported by Sithe Energies, developed a partnership with a company named Softbank to establish a unit called K Road Ventures. This company represented Vivendi's strategy of creating an Internet company specializing in B-to-B services for utilities and energy services.All of these developments indicated that, although Vivendi planned to remain involved in the energy industry, its focus was no longer on building a generation portfolio through Sithe Energies. Rather, Vivendi is building on its role as a major player in communications and environmental services. The subtext of this new direction for the company is probably Vivendi's attempt to reduce the debt of its subsidiaries to a reported 111 billion euros by the end of this year. Yet, most financial analysts agree that the continuing divestiture of Sithe Energies marks Vivendi's complete withdrawal from the energy production business. Vivendi has been in the process of spinning off a new utilities arm named Vivendi Environnment, which will provide energy services such as equipment installation and maintenance, as well as water and wastewater treatment. The K Road Ventures unit probably will be operated within Vivendi Environnment; however, it appears fairly certain that generation is no longer a part of the company's primary strategy.According to Vivendi, this divestiture confirms the exit of Sithe North America from the consolidation scope of Vivendi Universal. Including the divestiture of GPU, which took place at the beginning of the year, the transactions represent a total debt reduction of around 4 billion euros and a net capital gain of 170 million euros in the financial statements for 2000.Presently across North America, Sithe Energies still owns and operates about 27 power generation plants with approximately 3,8000 MW of net merchant generating capacity. Further divestiture of these assets is expected as Sithe and Vivendi continue to move away from power generation. PECO (now Exelon) and Reliant are two companies that have quickly picked up the generation assets divested by Sithe Energies, and has been a wise move for both companies. There should be a continuing high value placed on generation assets in the Northeastern United States, particularly since competitive markets are developing more rapidly in that region of the country. Reliant's purchase of the Sithe Energies' 21 plants supports its strategy of acquiring generation assets and developing a strong retail capability. Purchasing 49.9 percent of Sithe Energies, with the option to buy the rest of the company in as little as two years, is also a smart move for Exelon. The Power Generation Group (PGG) of PECO, which remains a subsidiary under the new Exelon holding company, is the business unit responsible for managing the fossil and hydro generating stations of the company. PGG manages a fleet of 72 generating units that can provide 52000 megawatts (MW) of power using a variety of fuels. These units include coal, natural gas, oil, landfill gas, and hydroelectric power plants. Under deregulation, this variety of fuels is helping PECO to remain competitive and prepared to meeting the energy needs of diverse customers. Presently, Exelon is the largest energy company in the United States, but will trumped by the Entergy/FPL Group combination, which is expected to close over the next year. The addition to Exelon's generation arsenal that it gains from almost half the shares of Sithe Energies should factor in nicely to Exelon's overall position in the industry. Exelon estimates that the initial investment in Sithe will contribute approximately $0.01 per share to its consolidated earnings in 20001 and 20002. And it certainly appears that Exelon aims to acquire the totality of Sithe's assets, based on comments coming out of the company's headquarters. If Exelon were to purchase the remaining 50.1 percent of Sithe (as soon as two years from now), Exelon anticipates that the transaction would contribute approximately $0.15 to its annual consolidated earnings. This may be just the move that Exelon has in mind as a complete acquisition of Sithe's assets would increase Exelon's generation portfolio to 46,5000 MW, which is perhaps just what it needs to secure its place as one of the nation's top generating companies and keep it in the running with FPL / Entergy.===SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

Former Senator Ford knew Linda's father well plus has dinner with Linda every several weeks or so.   There probably isn't anyone in Washington closer to Linda than Wendell as he has known her since she was a child.   Andy is expecting either Steve's or Rick's phone call to further discuss the Senator's involvement.   Andy did discuss in general that he wasn't certain whether his client, EPSA, would go along with the strategy but he thought, overall, it was a possibility.   Andy's direct number is 202-828-22259.   I know Andy and Wendell very well and would like to be helpful as you wish.   However, at this point, I thought an EPSA board member (i.e. Steve or Rick) should follow up.   thanks.\n"

Ellen Wolf (of Tabors Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.   In the presentation and the meeting we made the following points:There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in the wholesale market.   We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West as well.High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.   The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by scarcity.   They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time prices.   My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund as an asset allocation scheme.The market would function better if more information was provided to the market.The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.   When you do, you will find there are many \"hidden\" slides that were not part of the oral presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional information.According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the generators.   Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff is looking into the data we provided.   I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to Scott Miller on Friday.   Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a different approach to conveying the message.   On Friday, Tim talked to Scott and answered some additional questions.   Tim said that Enron is in favor of eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be able to buy from Enron Online.   He also explained more fully the existence of scarcity .   \n"

Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should be on your calendars.As a brief update prior to our call:We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the merger.   Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of our proceeding.   Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case.Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact.   Chris is working with some political operatives on this.We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing.   As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties.   An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23.   While RTO progress has been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO).   We are working with Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' commitment to join an RTO.There was some question about the status of a temporary services company being created by the merged company.   Joanne has been working with the Sierra and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, but I have asked her for confirmation that this \"alternative\" type of service company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.   I am waiting for a response from Joanne.Please let me know if you have any questions.   Sarah\n"

They have asked to have a demonstration in detail of EPMI's systems that track OASIS and market information.   Many of them have not seen EOL, so we need to show them that as well.The fact that this group is made up of so many FERC office directors means that this visit comes at the request of the Chairman Hoecker.   They will be visiting Dynegy and El Paso later that day.They are definitely interested in a good presentation from Enron, as we have given them in the past --- primarily because they met so many senior Enron executives.   It would be great if Dave Delainey or John Lavorato could also come by to meet them.Thanks.---",

All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr) Price Mitigation -   The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market.   During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&amp;M.   The gas cost will be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).   The gas cost and emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.   A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.   Highest bid sets the clearing price.   Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit.   The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.   In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price.   FERC has 60 days to review/act.   No opportunity costs in real time.   Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost.   However, credit sleeves are permissible.Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids.   FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.   (24-7)   Outages --- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC. Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 or Order lapses with no further effect.ISO Reporting - On September 14, 20001, ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built.   Comments are due in 15 days.   Quarterly reports thereafter.Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.   Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior.   An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate.   In addition, \"hockey stick\" bids are expressly prohibited (i.e.   bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.   Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7%.   Control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs.   Apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified.   All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within WSCC.   FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.   Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.   The refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the Order.Nox Limits in California ---   Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law.   However, it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part of the price bid.   Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.   Surcharge to pay past amount due --- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the PG&amp;E bankruptcy filing.   No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from California.   The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.   We will keep you posted.RA \n"

(1)   the call in information for Friday's conference call;(2)   a summary of yesterday's conference call (from Jeff Dasovich, Enron);(3)   two documents that list the contact information we have received to date (please email Steve Kean @ skean.enron.com if any changes/additions need to be made to the list).   As we receive more contact information, revised lists will be emailed to everyone.___A conference call has been scheduled for Friday, May 18th.   If credit issues are to be discussed, this is the call in number we will use.   If credit issues are not to be discussed, a separate call in number will be set up and you will be notified with the new dial in numbers.DATE:   Friday, May 18thTIME:   10:000 am (Central) - should last approx 1 hourCALL IN #:   1-8777-214-0402HOST CODE: 5647778   (Steve Kean's use only)PARTICIPANTCODE:   285987If anyone needs to call in from an international location, please contact Maureen McVicker at 713-853-1808 and she will set up an international number too.___Here is the summary Jeff Dasovich sent regarding yesterday's conference call.Greetings:In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it.   Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc.   Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything.Best,JeffSUMMARYEnron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors).On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate.A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops.Folks agreed that achieving a comprehensive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution.It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento.It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week.There was some discussion regarding the release today of \"Plan B.\"   Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison.   After that call I received a copy of \"Plan B.\"   If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number.Folks on the call agreed to have the next \"supplier-only\" call-in meeting on Friday.Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a \"ratings agency level\" presentation prepared by the end of the week.   The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates.The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's StaffItem #1:   The Credit IssueMichael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue.   Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR.   The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered.   If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow.   Item #2:   Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution.It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution.Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are.   The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion.Utility creditworthinessretail rates must reflect costsIncrease supplystreamline and otherwise reform the siting processDecrease demandestablish real-time pricingimplement demand buy-down and other conservation programsCreate a real marketRemove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months)Return the procurement role to the utilitiesReinstate Direct Access immediately for all customersWithin 18-24 months, create a \"core/noncore\" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gasKeep the industry in the hands of the private sectorReject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc.Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)___Attached are the contact lists.\n"

        " Karen Denne/Corp/Enron on 09/21/2000 09:17 PM ---From: Jeff Dasovich@EES on 09/21/2000 07:59 PMTo: mpalmer@enron.com, Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: FYI.Energy Is HotBy Christopher Edmonds Special to TheStreet.com9/20/000 12:47 PM ET URL: http:///www.thestreet.com/comment/christopheredmonds/1088836.htmlHOUSTON --- Up and to the right. That could be the theme of the eighth annual Dain Rauscher Wessels energy conference this week in America's self-proclaimed oil capital. Between the whispers in the hallways and the bullish presentations from an overflowing barrel of oil, gas and power companies, you might think you were in the corridors of some Silicon Valley conference of yesteryear. But, no, this is all about energy, and energy is hot. With oil hanging around $37 per barrel and natural gas solidly above $5 per million BTU, oil, gas and power stocks have caught fire. To illustrate, take a look at the chart of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Oil Service Sector Index, or OSX: Up and to the right. And, a great deal of the price gain is rational. As the price of the commodities increases, profits follow. That should mean positive earnings from a plethora of oil and gas companies. While new Securities and Exchange Commission regulations have stifled the more explicit (now illicit) preannouncements at conferences like this, regulations can't cap all the enthusiasm from rising commodity prices. For example, Kenneth Lay, chairman of energy powerhouse Enron (ENE:NYSE), said at the conference he is very comfortable with analysts' estimates, hinting the numbers are conservative. \"We should meet or exceed analysts' expectations for the quarter and the year.\" Others followed suit. Bradley Fischer, president of CMS Energy Oil and Gas (CMS:NYSE), (profiled here earlier ), said his company will post \"record production and record income this year,\" because the fundamentals of the oil and gas business are as good as they have been in his career. \"I've been in this business 28 years. The first 10 were good and the last 18 have been difficult. Now, I'm looking for the good times to roll.\" And this from Diana Naylor, senior vice president at independent power producer Calpine (CPN:NYSE), when reacting to analysts' estimates in the coming year. \"We look to be making that number and look to increase that [guidance on earnings] shortly.\" Even the oil drillers and equipment companies are celebrating. Nabors Industries (NBR:AMEX), owner of the largest land-drilling fleet, thinks analysts are significantly underestimating its potential. Dain Rauscher estimates Nabors will earn 83 cents per share this year and $1.65 next year --- numbers Chairman and CEO Eugene Isenberg called conservative. He presented calculations suggesting the company could earn $3.27 in the middle of the oil cycle and has the ability to earn $6.81 in the coming years. \"The probability of this happening is very high,\" he said. All because of $37 per barrel oil and $5 gas? While there is little question that third- and fourth-quarter earnings should be strong, there is growing concern that the oil and gas stock rally has been overdone. Not only have stocks tracked the rise in commodity prices but the once-beleaguered sector has also seen earnings multiples expand significantly. That is a warning sign to at least one analyst. While the going is good, the rapid price rise isn't sustainable. Oil stocks stocks \"will peak in the next several weeks and trade sideways, probably for the rest of the year,\" said Jim Wicklund, head of energy research at Dain Rauscher, adding that there may be added selling pressure as funds try to lock in gains before the end of the year. \"Stock [price pressure] will also be impacted by portfolio managers' bonus structure.\" And Wicklund warned that what he sees as the inevitable moderation in oil prices will put pressure on the stocks into the new year. \"Right or wrong, stock prices are slaves to commodity prices.\" If Wicklund is correct, the next move could be down and to the left. The Peoples CourtOne of the clever and unique features of the Dain Rauscher Wessels energy conference is the annual investor poll. This year, nearly 4000 investors responded to the on-site survey and, while the results aren't scientific, they are likely instructive. Power to the People - Investors SpeakDain Rauscher Wessels Energy Conference Survey ResultsPrediction for price of oil (per barrel)on 12/31/2000$32.70Prediction for price of oil (per barrel)on 12/31/2000127.70Average price of oil in 2000128.80Price of Natural Gas (per MM BTU) on 12/31/20005.50Price of Natural Gas (per MM BTU) on 12/31/200014.60Closing Price of Oil Stock Index (OSX) on 12/31/2000137.90Closing Price of Oil Stock Index (OSX) on 12/31/200011147.000Will the OSX outperform theS&amp;P 5000 in 2000Yes - 93.7%, No - 6.3%Will the OSX outperform the S&amp;P 5000 in 20001Yes - 67.7%, No - 32.3% Favorite Merger PartnersChevron with Texaco, Unocal or Phillips - 35%Top Energy Stocks for the Next YearKey Energy, ExxonMobil, Enron Presidential Straw PollBush 53%, Gore 47%Source: Dain Rauscher WesselsInvestors see oil prices moderating a little between now and December and further into next year. However, survey participants do not see the same pattern for natural gas, with estimates for gas prices remaining well above $4.50 through next year. And what may at first appear to be good news for George W. Bush probably isn't. A six-point lead looks nice, but remember --- we're on his home turf, Texas, among his brethren in the oil business. For W., that may suggest down and to the left as well. \n"

Ordinarily, I would be happy toparticipate.   However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) onOctober 1.   Judging from the last time she went through this I will have tostay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10.   Too bad.On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company toget in touch with me?   I would like to set something up with MIT'sexecutive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, includingenergy purchases and management.   We have a 222 MW cogenerator, buy gas andelectricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an evergrowing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computerfacilities and laboratories.

The Dems, of course, love to get this sort of thing going, as itenables them to hold hearings on the need for further legislation tore-regulate. The fact that this President's father came to the White Housein the denouement of a multi-billion dollar savings and loan crisis which hedid not create is also usually forgotten.As I said in my voicemail and as the attached article confirms, I thinkthere is no substance to the rumor that Sen. Gramm would be opposed to mynomination.

Thecurrent challenges are keeping company's management busy. Being aware ofthis I wanted to take liberty of asking, if it would be possible to getsomeone of Enron's top executive to contribute Nokia's top executivedevelopment program. We have invited a few external key note speakers toelaborate their company's transformation. This kind of experience change hasproved to be beneficial for both parties. Also Nokia's experiences have beenvaluable input in certain restructuring processes.This program, called Panorama, is an annual top executive developmentprogram, which takes about half a year in three modules. In every year wehave nominated 35 participants to this intensive action. The program targetis three folded, give input to company's strategy development, strengthenand integrate common understanding of company's direction, and developleadership capacity. The program owner is Jorma Ollila, CEO of Nokia.What are benefits from Enron's point of view in the case we are able to getsomeone of Enron's executives in the program? I think that one of the mostimportant outcome of this kind of events is   to open a dynamic networkingand discussion forum between our executives. Both parties could capitalizethis cooperation.In short, we would appreciate very much if we could have your company'spresentation in this Panorama forum.Looking forward to hearing from you,Yours sincerely,Juhani Hokkanen,Senior Vice President, Human Resources DevelopmentNokia GroupTel.

The formal court hearing of the appeal is still scheduled for 60 to 90 days from now.   We would like Ken to phone Charlie Reed, Chancellor of CSU,   and solicit Charlie's support for Enron, CSU, and the UC system to get back together to attempt to work out a commercial resolution to these issues.   We believe that sponsorship and support coming from the most senior executives' offices will help bring the parties together.   Additionally, if CSU and UC are interested in working out a settlement, we would like to solicit their joint request for a delay in the court calendar.   This would allow both teams to focus on a commercial resolution versus splitting their focus between a settlement and preparing briefs for the appeal appearance.   We would like to see a delay request of one month, as long as the settlement discussions progress.   A desirable way to kick off settlement discussions would be to ask Ken to have lunch with the Head of UC , Charlie Reed of CSU, and perhaps one business lead (in this case, this could be me).   I am not sure that Ken's schedule could accomadate that, but I thought I would ask.   If timing is bad for a meeting like this, we can find a different alternative.   I will follow up with a phone call to you.   Hope this helps.\n"

The partners will build a natural-gas-fired power stationwhose 5000-megawatt capacity will represent 30 percent of thecountry's current electricity demand, said Fenosa in a note,confirmed with the company.   The generator will run on liquefied natural gas when itstarts operating in 20002, switching to fuel from the re-gasification plant when it starts operating in 20003.   Fenosa has had an alliance with International Power Plc,formerly National Power Plc, since 19998. That alliance focuses onEurope, the U.S. and Australia, a Fenosa spokeswoman said today.   Enron was the first U.S. utility to receive licenses to buy,sell and import electricity in Spain, after the government startedopening energy markets to competition in 19998. It's also licensedto market natural gas.   The Texas-based utility is building a gas-fired power plantin southern Spain, has a wind turbine factory near Toledo, andplans another windmill factory in Catalonia.---Brooke Nelson in the Madrid bureau (34 91) 7000-96000 orb.nelson@bloomberg.net   /phStory illustration: UNF SM &lt;Equity&lt; COMP D to chart Fenosa'sperformance against the IBEX index.TOP NRGDJ Union Fenosa/Enron -2: Construction To Begin 20001 &lt;E.FEN10/10/0 12:40 (New York)   MADRID (Dow Jones)---Spanish electricity company Union Electrica Fenosa SA(E.FEN) said late Tuesday it has reached an agreement with U.S. energy companyEnron (ENE) to invest in energy infrastructure projects in the DominicanRepublic.   In a release, Fenosa said the deal involves the construction of acombined-cycle power plant with a 5000MW potency, which will use natural gasfrom a regasification plant on the island nation.   The 5000MW potency is equivalent to 30% of the Caribbean island's electricitydemand.   The deal also includes a complimentary project, Fenosa said. This is theconstruction of a regasification plant on the republic's coastline, with acapacity for treating gas equivalent to the consumption of various groups ofcombined-cycle plants with a potency of 13000MW.   The investment for these two projects is seen at around $5550 million, ofwhich $1000 million could come from Dominican companies, Fenosa said.   Fenosa and Enron estimate that construction of the two projects will begin inearly 20001, with the power plant coming online in 20002. It will operate withcombustible liquid until 20003, at which time the regasification plant comesonline.   (MORE) DOW JONES NEWS   10-10-000   12:40 PM- - 12 40 PM EDT 10-10-000\n"

I am leaving with regret,   as I have enjoyed working with all of you, and I believe EBS   is poised for great success in Asia.   To assist in a smooth transition,   I have prepared   this report on   the status of all EBS East Asia regulatory affairs actions I am working on,   and my thoughts about next steps.   A list of key contacts is also provided.   Mark   Schroeder will reassign pending actions.   Again, many, many thanks for your support and encouragement and for what I have   learned about broadband and EBS from each of you. 1.   Singapore (a)   SBO License Application:   The application was completed in draft in December.   Dan Arzola of EBS Asia   has a copy in Houston.   We cannot proceed further on the application until we   decide what   legal entity to use.   We have a legal entity (Enron Broadband   Services Pte Ltd) set up that encompasses all EBS activities including bandwidth t   trading.   The legal entity that we use in the application will have to pay a 1% annual gross   turnover fee unless we get it waived by the regulator on the grounds that the   turnover fee was never intended to capture bandwidth trading revenue.   This   is a possible option in my opinion as the regulator (IDA) does not want to be working at cross   purposes with other parts of the government that wish to provide EBS with incentives.   See below.   (b)   Legal Due Diligence:   However, before pursuing a waiver from IDA,   we were planning to complete legal due   diligence to examine any options for avoiding the fee without a waiver.   Donald is of the view (see his Jan 9 e-mail ) that bandwidth trading has to be   licensed by the regulator.   ( In Europe, bandwidth trading usually does not   require telecom licensing.)   If Donald is correct as he probably is, there may be   less need of further legal research   on that point unless perhaps to confirm absolutely   that there is no way to shield EBS bandwidth trading from the turnover fee apart from   a waiver or reduction of the fee.   For example it is possible   that Jan Haizmann   or others may figure out a way to have actual trades escape the fee (done offshore   for example).   Jan I believe has some ideas on this that he adanced in the context   of Korea.   I believe it would still be prudent   to proceed as we had planned to engage   a law firm here in Singapore (as we have in Hong Kong and Japan) for the purpose   of guiding us through these sorts of questions (or at least confirming our reading)   and answering the many other questions posed in a matrix developed by a working   group headed by Wayne Gardner.   We will likely be needing the firm anyway at   some point.   I have prepared a list of seven law firms engaged in telecoms practice in Singapore.   EBS General Counsel is planning to examine its Asia strategy and whom to send and   when to engage a firm to complete Wayne's questionnaire and for other purposes.   My advice is, after the due diligence is completed or we have at least confirmed   that bandwidth trading is required to be in the licensed entity,   probably to go to the IDA and   discuss the implications of the fee for us.   The contacts I would suggest discussing this   with are Andy Haire and Fiona Yeo (see contact list).]   IDA does not wish to prevent   EBS's coming to Singapore, and the fee was of course set up without bandwidth trading   specifically in mind as a revenue source.   Bandwidth trading was referenced in the   Code only later as a result of Enron's comment letters.   &amp;copy;   Arthur D Little consultant proposal to support EBS Pioneer Status Application   This 75k proposal is now with us in final form, after undergoing changes by me   and two by our Houston tax lawyers.   I was to have gone to ADL Singapore next   for a meeting to question them on how much of this they are able to   do independently without reliance on us.   This was a suggestion made by   Jim Ginty of EBS tax to make sure they would not be reprocessing our info,   I also intended to get them to pinpoint which of the products would be quantified,   rather than a \"where appropriate.\"   Assuming we proceed with this proposal,   someone else will need to do this conversation with ADL Singapore.   I have forwarded the final proposal to Wayne Garder and Mark and most other   interested parties earlier this week.   NB:   Someone needs to be appointed to contact Simon MacCormac at ADL and explain   at least our timing and process for getting back to him, as a courtesy.   I have not   replied to his final submission as of now.   See contact info at end of e-mail.   For background,   the reason I believe EBS needs this work and sought a consultant   proposal is that Pioneer Status is typically awarded   to companies that make major   dollar, infrastructure, and job-creation expenditures in Singapore.   Our business   model does just the opposite.   So, to be awarded Pioneer Status, which the EDB is   very willing to consider us for after many months of persuasion,   I believe we need to   help EDB demonstrate what the quantitative spin-off benefits are for Singapore from our   developing bandwidth trading here (e.g. increased efficiencies of capacity utilization,   effect of lower bandwidth prices on attracting investment).   This is a job for a   development   economist teamed with someone who knows about bandwidth trading.   To my mind,   if ADL cannot produce the bandwidth trading specialist we want, it might be worth it   to have one of our experts assigned to liaise with   them, and adjust the contract   accordingly to reflect what part we are providing.   One thing the ADL scope of work does not provide for is the actual completion of   the Pioneer Status Application - only the supporting economic analysis.   That is because it is   proper for us to be the ones outlining our business plan for Singapore, rather than   running that information through ADL and charging its overhead.   The idea is to get   ADL to perform the quantitative economic development analysis we cannot do in-house.   (d)   Direct contact with EDB on EBS's plans   EDB (Chelsia Lim ) has this week asked EBS to update her on its business   plans for Singapore.   I have made sure Craig Clark will take the responsibility   for seeing this is handled.   While a courtesy call is fine, I would advise   not to brief her formally until EBS has really decided what our plans are,   with staffing, etc.   They have been asking for our plans for a while, and   are waiting for some specifics when we have them.2.   Hong Kong   We have   2 licenses:   IVANS (value added services) and ETS (external   telecoms services (includes bandwidth trading).   There are several documents in draft and clearance which need to be filed   under these licenses before we are able to operate in Hong Kong.   The principal ones are (a)   the system configuration plan,   (b) the tariff for   sale and trading of circuits under the ETS license &amp;copy; the tariff for Mediacast   services under the IVANS license, and (later) (d) a tariff for VOD/EOD to   be filed under the IVANS license.   (a)   status of system configuration plan:   The plan is done in draft and is being held pending a decision to be   communicated by Roger Estrada within the next week or two as to whether   the Lucent 10G equipment described in the plan will be changed to other   equipment.   The HK lawyers   (Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance)   have said   that if we plan to provide other equipment at the outset, we ought to just   wait and send in the correct description rather than revise.   If we do stick with   the Lucent equipment , we will also need to revise our orginal license   application as well (says Michelle Chan)   to include description of related   Cisco equipment that was not mentioned in our orginal license application.   When the system configuration plan is done in final, we also need to   change the listed destination in the diagram from \"San Jose\"   to \"West Coast   USA,   Japan, Singapore, and Australia\".   There are two copies of the present draft submission typed on the OFTA forms.   I have given one to Craig Clark of EBS to carry back to Houston.   The other   copy is with Annie Ng in our Singapore office.   When we know what equipment we are going to be using, Tom Wei needs to   revise the diagram and also make the changes in destination referred to above.   Other small edits need to be made in Appendix A (see Dec 28 e-mail referenced   below).   My successor should review the whole package once more with Michelle   Chan in final.   Then the final package needs to be cleared by Anthony Duenner   and our EBS lawyers before going to Ken Rice or another qualified Director of   our Hong Kong company for signature.   After that it goes back to Michelle Chan   for filing with OFTA.   NB:   See Michelle Chan's e-mail of Dec 28, being repeated separately, for   further information.   (b)   Tariffs for BWTrading under ETS License   In December in Houston I worked with Bill White and his staff on a tariff plan for   bandwidth trading in HK.   Based on a meeting I had with the regulator in Hong   Kong,   we agreed to file pro forma ceiling prices rather than an entirely new   and variable system which the regulator insisted we not do.   Ceiling   prices   were developed and submitted to Michelle Chan for review.   Along with the prices we are required to submit our Terms and Conditions.   For   that I used EBS General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) for trading obtained from   Robbi Rossi and Michelle Heard.   Mike Grimes   has a set as well.   Present status:   Right now a dialogue is under way between Michelle Chan and   Robbi Rossi as to whether it is sufficient to file the GTC's alone or whether   certain exhibits, service level agreements, and confirmations referred to in   the GTC's must also be filed.   There are other questions being discussed in   that channel   such as how to handle variations in the terms based on   commercial dynamics.   All these e-mails will be   forwarded.   Once these   issues related to the GTCs are resolved, the tariff for bandwidth trading should   be filed, going through Michelle Chan.   NB:   See Michelle Chan e-mail of 1/09/01 which being forwarded separately.   &amp;copy;   Tariff for Media Cast under IVANS license:   I worked with Leroy Ho and Ken Wang in December and we submitted the main   part of the Media Cast tariff to Michelle Chan.   However, we still need to get the   Terms and Conditions for Media Cast from Robbi Rossi or Michelle Heard and   attach them to the tariff diagrams and submit them to Michelle Chan.   NB:   See my e-mail to Michelle Chan of Dec 21 which being repeated.   Someone needs to work with EBS legal to get the T and C's for Media Cast to Michelle   or to set up direct channel between EBS legal and Michelle Chan as in   the case of the exchanges on the T and C's for Bandwidth trading referred   to above.   (d)   Overall change of responsibility for EBS Regulatory HK   Michael,   or whomever will be taking over these responsibilities, should   get from Michelle Chan of Clifford Chance Hong Kong a fresh copy of   Alison Lindsay's letter to Xi Xi of October 2000 stating that we received   our licenses and setting forth in detail all of the requirements.   This is the   master document (\"bible\") on compliance under our licenses and will catch any   detail not included above.   For example:   - my successor should also file a new form with OFTA,   the Hong Kong   regulator (form is included in the attachments to the letter)   naming   himself the point of contact, replacing me.   Michelle Chan can forward   the letter to the regulator.   -   we will need to be selecting an independent auditor to certify certain routine   reports we may need to file in future.   I have not started on that.3.   Korea   Robbi Rossi needs to call Kim and Chang (law firm we use in Korea)   to authorize them to research and provide advice to us on how to handle   the apparent regulatory impediment to Bandwidth Trading in Korea that   we identified during my November trip.   Once Kim and Chang starts work on this, someone from regulatory should   be made available to help guide Kim and Chang on our regulatory   questions, in coordination with Robbi Rossi.   The key e-mails are (a) one from me outlining the overall problem and   some suggestions for dealing with it ;   (b) one from Jan Haizmann with   some additional and in some cases alternative suggestions on how   to deal with it,   &amp;copy;   two from Jae Moo Lee in Korea with additional   points of view.   These will be forwarded.   4.   Japan   Our regulatory consultant is Art Yanagawa.   Contact info below.   Mike Grimes   and I have been in meetings with him and   Mike is fully briefed to carry on the   on-the-ground   part of contacts with Art.   Art also responds to Donald and   Roger Estrada and relies on them for guidance and input.   At some point it should be thought through who should be the point person   to manage   this contract and approve payments, or decide to leave things   as they are with approvals done in Houston.   The present system works but   it is not clear to me who is responsible for what.   Art has prepared the amendment to our Special Type 2   license to add   service to other destinations.   The latest status was that he was holding   the amendment over the holidays while clarifying some points raised by   Mike Grimes.   Someone needs to be assigned responsibility for   getting the amendment through.   General Concern:   A more general regulatory concern for us in Japan is that our consultant   advises us that we cannot use the term bandwidth trading   in   communications with the government because it is not something   contemplated in the Telecom Business Law,   so is prohibited if   stated as we would state it elsewhere.   We therefore are having to go through elaborate contortions to make   what we are planning to do actually look like we are doing something   else.   I admit that I agree with the approach we are taking for now and   can offer nothing better for the immediate term.   However, I would say that long term we are running some risks.   If we   are going to make Japan   one of the centerpieces of our   Asia EBS   strategy,   I think we need to consider devoting more full time EBS   regulatory resources to Japan exclusively.   The allocation problem is that whatever regulatory resources we apply   have to focus on   immediate license amendment   and operational   questions that drive out time to work effectively on long term   issues such as how to go about amending the Telecommunications   Business Law   to allow bandwidth trading explicitly.   This would seem   important to reduce long term risks to our business strategy. 5.   \"Digital Divide\"   I had been giving intermittent support to helping Scott Yeager and Justin   Cornett of EBS, and Will Reed of Technology for All, figure out how   to expand the concept of Technology for All to Asia.   The strategy   was to utilize some of Japan's $15 billion pledge of funds to support   digital divide activities in Asia - to support the expansion into Asia of   the EBS-supported TFA model.   This work will cease unless it can   be picked up by Laura Lannarone of corporate social responsbility   or Steve Burns of the DC office.   6.

Appeal of Denials of Petitions to DEP, DCA, and PSCChris Jensen, Executive Director of the Florida Energy Pipeline Association, has learned from some DEP agency contacts that the Alliance (operating behind the front organization known as Friends of the Aquifer, Inc.) has decided to drop their lawsuits appealing the denials of their petitions to more severely regulate pipelines in Florida.   While this is good news for those of us fighting the war here in Florida, the reason for this withdrawal of their appeals of failed efforts on three different petitions at the state level in Florida is because of their belief that their current activity at the Federal level holds greater promise of success and their desire to concentrate their resources in that effort.My thoughts on this is that the pipeline industry should get organized and execute a \"full court press\" defense which is proactive as we move into increased future efforts at the   Federal level by the Alliance through their other front organizations.   These organizations have been created to burden pipeline competition to benefit the maritime interests.From my vantage point I am limited to mostly what I see in the press, but   these front organization are winning the battle in the national press that I have seen and heard.   AOPL and INGAA do not come across in the press as being equipped or prepared to handle the shaping of the pipeline safety issues in the press that these Alliance front organizations have been doing. Our Enron government affairs folks in Washington are knowledgeable, experienced and capable. They have been through this battle and other battles in the past.   So this is not a criticism, but just a friendly observation from a remote vantage point, that if the entire pipeline industry does not develop a proactive plan to shape the issues in the national media during the next year, we will find it very difficult or perhaps impossible to come out of Congress with legislation that is reasonable and workable from a safety regulation perspective.   It has been my experience with the Alliance in the past, that to any extent they are successful,   they will then multiply their efforts and broaden their field of attack.The issue is not safety of pipelines, but competition for the transportation of energy.   We have an industry that can be very proud of it's record of safety, economic benefits, reliability, public service, energy efficiency and environmentally favorable service when compared to any other mode of transporting energy.   We have learned from our experiences, research and mistakes in the past and will continue to learn in the future so that future pipeline service will be even better for our people whom we serve.   Our entire energy pipeline industry (natural gas and petroleum) needs to shape the issues in the national press and tell our very good story so the politicians are not overrun with public opinion shaped by our maritime competition. Thanks for your interest.   This is a \"heads-up\" that is probably not needed, but I felt that there might be something in it that would help with a very difficult current and future issue.\n"

The money is contained in the Interior Appropriation bill that=20\rPresident Clinton signed last week. The House and Senate jointly agreed=20\rupon $52.7 million for stationary fuel cells, $10 million more than=20\rrequested,=20\rand approved the full request of $41.5 million for transportation fuel=20\rcell research and $5.5 million for buildings.\r ANALYSIS: This government funding, which is surprisingly higher than=20\rexpected,=20\rshould give a much-needed boost to the slow-moving development of fuel=20\rcells. Although generally considered the favorite of low / zero emission=20\renergy solutions, fuel cells are still about two to three years away from=\r=20\rbeing commercially viable in retail markets. (Phosphoric acid fuel cells,=\r=20\rdeveloped by ONSI, a division of United Technologies, are presently availab=\rle=20\rin a limited capacity). The technology has been in existence ever since=20\rbatteries were discovered 160 years ago, but the high cost of producing=20\rthem has precluded suppliers from making fuel cells readily available to=20\rthe general public. Automotive giants like DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor=\r=20\rCo. have continued to explore the use of fuel cells in automobiles, and=20\rTexaco, Inc. agreed in May to invest $67.2 million in Energy Conversion=20\rDevices, a 40-year-old fuel cell and alternative energy development firm.=\r=20\rYet, this financial support for the DOE's exploration of fuel cells signals=\r=20\rsignificant support from the federal government. In addition, warnings=20\rabout the high cost of oil and natural gas, and the reports of low supplies=\r=20\rof energy in states across the country, continue to scare energy end-users=\r=20\rand may be spurring a renewed interest in distributed generation options.\r Here's how fuel cells work. They use an electrochemical reaction, as oppose=\rd=20\rto traditional combustion, to generate electricity. In other words, fuel=20\rcells allow hydrogen-rich fuels to react chemically with air, without=20\rburning,=20\rproducing as a byproduct DC electricity, water and heat. In addition, fuel=\r=20\rcells dramatically lower the level of pollutants that are emitted into=20\rthe environment. Test models of fuel cells presently convert methanol,=20\rgasoline and natural gas to produce hydrogen fuel. It's easiest to think=20\rof a fuel cell as a battery, but one that does not run down or need=20\rrecharging=20\r(although it will need replacing about every five years). A fuel cell will=\r=20\rproduce energy in the form of DC electricity and heat as long as fuel is=20\rsupplied. As an added advantage, fuel cells can be controlled remotely=20\rby computer and run rather quietly. This is perhaps the primary incentive=\r=20\rfor end-users that would be interested in fuel cell technology. Especially=\r=20\rfor facilities like hospitals, the attributes of low noise and near-zero=20\rpollution are very appealing.\r Currently, fuel cells are being tested and developed by laboratories and=20\rthink tanks around the world, hoping to make this low-polluting form of=20\rgeneration available for widespread use by 20002 or 20003. Under the DOE=20\rgrant, money provided for stationary fuel cells will fund research and=20\rdevelopment to reduce costs and improve performance. It is hoped that this=\r=20\rwill lead to market-ready fuel cell power systems within three years. In=20\raddition, the funding allocates $41.5 million to transportation fuel cell=\r=20\rresearch such as integrating fuel cell stacks with fuel processors and=20\rbalance-of-plant technologies for testing. This program also will examine=\r=20\rthe technology barriers to fuel-flexible systems for automobile application=\rs.=20\rThe $5.5 million reserved for buildings will go toward developing a prototy=\rpe=20\rfuel processor, completing the design competition for a 50kW co-generator=\r=20\rfor buildings, and other research and development.\r Deregulation has cast light on alternative forms of power supply. As=20\rcustomers=20\rpossibly decide to use on-site generation as opposed to power delivered=20\racross a transmission grid, this dramatically alters the traditional busine=\rss=20\rof most energy companies. Large commercial and industrial customers that=20\rsuddenly opt for fuel cell solutions to their energy needs would have=20\rdramatic=20\rfinancial impact on their incumbent energy provider. As a result, many=20\relectric utilities and energy providers are investing in fuel cells as=20\ra hedge against a possible shrinkage within their own supply businesses.=20\rSouthern Company is a good example. Just this month, Southern joined Alabam=\ra=20\rMunicipal Electric Authority, Mercedes-Benz U.S. International, Inc., and=\r=20\rFuelCell Energy in a partnership to \"drive a growing interest in fuel cell=\r=20\rtechnology.\" Specifically, Southern is providing funding for a fuel cell=20\rplant to be located in the service territory of Alabama Power, a Southern=\r=20\rsubsidiary. The plant will convert pipeline natural gas into electricity=20\rat a reported efficiency of about 50 percent, compared with 333 percent=20\rfor conventional generation, which will feed the power distribution system=\r=20\rof Mercedes-Benz.\r Another example is Enron, which just two weeks ago entered into an alliance=\r=20\rwith FuelCell Energy, Inc., to develop and market FuelCell Energy's Direct=\r=20\rFuelCell products, focusing on state renewable and energy conservation=20\rprograms. As part of the partnership, Enron is investing about $5 million=\r=20\rin the common stock of FuelCell Energy. In its announcement of the=20\rpartnership,=20\rEnron stated that \"the transaction enables us to reach the developing marke=\rts=20\rfor clean energy and renewable energy, which may be served through=20\rdistributed=20\rgeneration products, such as fuel cells.\"\r These are just two examples of many energy companies that are devoting=20\rmoney to fuel cells and other forms of distributed generation. Some state=\r=20\rregulatory commissions have debated whether or not to allow utilities to=20\rown their own distributed generation equipment technologies. As a result,=\r=20\rwe are seeing a trend of utilities investing in companies that are already=\r=20\rdeveloping distributed generation solutions, instead of doing it themselves=\r.\r The investment appears to be a smart one. According to Stephens, Inc.,=20\ran investment banking firm, common industry projections put the potential=\r=20\rfor the automotive fuel cell market at $50 billion annually by 2020 and=20\ras high as $1000 billion (cumulative) for the stationary power markets withi=\rn=20\r10 years. The increase is due in large part to the growth of Internet-based=\r=20\rindustry and the need for mission-critical systems at dot-com operations.=\r=20\rMicroturbines=01*small generators that can produce enough power for a small=\r=20\rbusiness=01*have beaten fuel cells to market and are currently manufactured=\r=20\rby the likes of Capstone, Caterpillar and Solar Turbines. Microturbines=20\rreportedly could be potentially superior to fuel cells with regard to low=\r=20\remissions. Many energy companies and power marketers such as Williams,=20\rAlliant Energy and American Energy Savings have made announcements just=20\rwithin the last month that they will market microturbines to customers.=20\rYet, the distributed generation market should become much tighter once=20\rfuel cells become commercially available, something that this hefty new=20\rgrant from the U.S. government should push forward.=20\r =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\rEl Paso Global Networks plans to spend up to $2 billion in the next few=20\ryears on telecom acquisitions.

This is truly a remarkable speech.FORD PREDICTS END OF CAR POLLUTIONThe Independent (UK)6 October 2000Internet:http:///www.independent.co.uk/news/UK/Environment/2000-10/ford061000.shtmlThe 1000-year reign of the polluting internal combustion engine is coming toan end, Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said yesterday. Itwill soon be replaced in motor vehicles by the hydrogen fuel cell, whichemits no pollution whatsoever and so can reduce the build-up of greenhousegases causing climate change, Mr. Ford, great-grandson of the company'sfounder, Henry Ford, told the Greenpeace Business Conference in London.In a remarkable speech from a motor manufacturer, in which he proclaimed hisown environmental credentials, Mr. Ford, 43, accepted that the automobile hadhad a serious negative impact on the environment, and that his industry hadwrongly played down the threat from global warming.   And the head of theworld's second biggest car company raised eyebrows even further when he saidthat he could foresee the day when people would not want to own cars, butmerely have access to mobility.Detroit-born Mr. Ford, who has been chairman since the start of last year,proclaimed that climate change was the most challenging issue facing theworld and that anyone who disagreed was \"in denial\". Ford itself had moved onfrom that position, he said. But he felt the Kyoto protocol, the 19997 pact inwhich the industrialised nations agreed to try to limit their emission ofgreenhouse gases, would not provide deep enough cuts to halt global warming.Only the marketplace, making new technology widely available, could tacklethe problem.A fuel cell creates energy by an electrochemical process similar to that in abattery: it lets hydrogen and oxygen react together to produce electricityand water vapour. It does not run down or need recharging, working as long asthe hydrogen fuel is available, but most importantly, it does not produce anyCO2, the basic by-product of any carbon-based fuel such as oil, gas or coal.Every major car company in the world is throwing huge sums into developingthe technology: Ford is spending $1bn (?690m) between now and 20004, whileDaimler-Chrysler, regarded as the leader in the field, has spent $7000m. Allthe main manufacturers have prototype fuel-cell cars running and there is arace to bring them to market. Honda and Toyota expect to do so in 20003, whileFord and Daimler-Chrysler are aiming at 20004.\"I believe fuel cells will finally end the 1000-year reign of the internalcombustion engine,\" Mr. Ford said, adding that the technology was \"the holygrail\" of the motor industry. Prophesying the demise of car ownership, hesaid:   \"The day will come when the whole notion of car ownership isantiquated,\" he said. Mr. Ford was reflecting advanced motor industrythinking, which suggests many people might not want to pay for a car of theirown if they could be guaranteed mobility on demand from a local hire network.\n"

The FERC has made itclear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to lift the price caps.On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (\"MS\").   As you may recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.   MS sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by FERC on the grounds that the complaint \"warrants expeditious action.\"As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority through 111/15/000.   That order stated that the ISO \"maximum purchase price was not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO was willing to pay.\"   The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the price cap could \"choose to sell those services into the California Power Exchange or bilateral markets.\"FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered the caps to $5000 and ISO further directed that, \"To the extent permitted by law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW.\"The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, \"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace.\"   MS also requested an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the price cap reduction.FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum purchase price be reinstated.   The Commission reiterates that it is not approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price they want.   Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to pay.   \"Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot dictate their price.\"Importantly, however, FERC also states that, \"ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services...if the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs.\"   [Emphasis added]   FERC then notes that this may lead to an increase in Out of Market (\"OOM\") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to a maximum purchase price.Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC states clearly that, \"such a requirement is not permitted by our November   12 Order and the ISO tariff.\"   [Emphasis added]FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to ISO's tariff.   This would require 60 days' advance notice, \"and could not be implemented prior to Commission approval.   As stated above, our November 12 Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase price.\"ISO is then \"put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper response to low supplies in the ISO markets.\"Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.   Massey suggests that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new generation and transmission projects in California.   Hebert says that the previous November Order tried to \"straddle the fence\" and that, \"Today, the Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of recognizing that we have a role.\"   He then reiterates his preference for removing all price caps.   He also suggests that, \"Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.   The record supports such a move.\"   He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, stating that it, \"thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a return to 'command and control.' \"   Hebert states that, \"The independence of the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.   We should 'stand up,' to quote the resignation letter.\"   Hebert advocates opening a section 206 proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power markets, \"including the California markets.\"This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that price.

InfrastructureWorld, of which I am co-founder and vice chairman, has recently   received $10 million each in funding from the IFC division of the World Bank and   Bechtel. GlobalCashExchange is a separate, but related business. We have the   plan, the experienced management team and proven technology, and we will be   selecting major financial institution as a partner. At the request of our corporate CFOs we are developing an internet based   exchange for foreign exchange, short-term cash and credit that could give Enron   a powerful product to sell to corporations worldwide. I have attached and   executive summary and a business plan. I would like to discuss this with you at   your earliest convenience.Major sources of trade, development and investment friction and inefficiency   in large developing countries in particular include the facilitation of foreign   exchange, short term cash, credit and working capital transactions. This is a   source of high cost and frustration even for major global corporations, and for   middle and smaller corporations these are even greater burdens. Today there are   no reliable and continuous flowing price sources for softer currencies as there   are for hard currencies. Even the larger soft currencies like the Real or Rupee   are quoted only 3 to 4 times a day on Reuters, and the only spot quotes are   available from traders who are motivated to benefit from a large spread. The   GlobalCashExchange will allow buyers to transact at the middle of the interbank   spread. There are lots of Internet based foreign exchanges, and none that I have   actually seen support buyer to buyer transactions.GlobalCashExchange will develop an Internet based exchange for foreign   exchange, short term cash and credit. The goal is to reduce costs of such   transactions. Global Cash Exchange can also greatly enhance capital formation   and the formation of local capital markets in developing countries. This is a   large and complex undertaking where we will need to be partnering with one or a   group of major financial institutions like Citibank, Cantor Fitzgerald, State   Street Bank, Schwab and the World Bank. As you know, the Foreign Exchange (FX) market is the largest and most   participated financial market in the world with over $1.5 trillion exchanges   daily throughout the world. There is no central market place for FX   transactions: all FX transactions are conducted through a network of banks,   dealers and brokers. Approximately 2/3 of FX transactions involve banks dealing   directly with each other. The potential market for short term cash and credit   ---which will ultimately reduce the need for foreign exchange transactions --- is   even larger.We are funding this internally and are starting to develop outside investor   support. We have established great partnerships with organizations such as   Standard &amp; Poor's and Medley Global Advisors   (http:///www.medleyadvisors.com), for ratings and content on the site, VMAC (a   division of FSA that has patented the concept of providing pooled credit   enhancement facilities http:///www.fsa.com), for revolving credit enhancement   facilities and Gen3Partners (http:///www.gen3partners.com), for strategic and   technological advice. Transactions that cannot be matched can be cleared through   Deerhurst, a leading foreign exchange fund manager who has agreed to provide   liquidity from day one. We also know that we can purchase insurance for around   $7 billion of annual transactions for just under $1M a year. GCX is now at a   point that it has answered most of the questions that we had. We have a   commitment from Ashton Technologies for full build out of SEC approved   technology in exchange for equity. This technology has been used successfully   for more complex securities transactions and allows for many equity market   facilities that Forex markets do not currently have such as reserve book, limit   order and so forth. A description of the Ashton technology and an executive   summary that we use for our corporate clients are attached. We have good corporate support through World Research Advisory (WRA), an   affiliated provider of research for corporate treasurers. WRA supplies Gartner   and Forrester type subscription research and advisory services to global 2000   companies. The contact list includes the CFO's of the following companies, many   of whom have agreed to participate in the Global Cash Exchange: ALCOA   ALLSTATE INSURANCE COMPANY   AT&amp;T   BELLSOUTH CORPORATION   CHUBB CORPORATION   CNF TRANSPORTATION, INC.

The Mayor has asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment.   As outlined in my December 6th memo --- the breakdown of the commitment was for Enron to contribute $5000,000 for the Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show on December 31, 1999.   The $250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package.   The Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at the time.   Will we be sponsoring the event?Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC in February 2000.Please let me know if you need additional information.Thank you. \n"

We've established a company-wide team and a working plan going forward, which includes:1.   EES commodity team is going to run the numbers for energy commodity for facilities and give them a proposal by end of next week.   While facilities will not be part of the TX pilot, EES can arrange a financial deal for them w/ an option of going physical on 1/1/02.   EES commodity team will also let the group know of the offer, in order to structure the REC deal.   Depending upon the savings that EES can offer to Facilities, we will determine any \"headroom\" for REC purchases.Note: It is not necessary for Facilities to sign a commodity deal w/ EES in order for the \"greening\" of the building to go forward.   The RECs can be purchased and retired irrespective of the commodity deal with EES.   HOWEVER, it would be optimum for Facilities to sign on w/ EES and use the cost savings toward purchase of the RECs.   Facilities stated intent to do the latter.2. Michael Payne and Mike Curry are going to be working on determining a cost for the RECs.   Michael initially projected $250,000 per year for the requisite number of RECs to retire commensurate w/ the demand of the building.   This was at a cost of $8 per REC, which I believe is quite high.   I think they'll go for a $1-4 dollar range, bringing the cost down to a max of $125,000.   There's several ways to slice this end.   We can provide some of the RECs from the EWC facility and buy other RECs from the market in order to minimize the cost impact of the REC purchases.3.   Next Thursday we will be able to get more of an exact figure on the premium cost for the RECs (ie how much over the cost savings will the RECs cost).   We will then need to decide the following: a. Would Corp/EHS being will to pitch in to cover any additional cost for the RECs; b. Pitching the idea to Skilling for buyoff, and payment for the RECs; c. Possibly getting buyoff from the business units since this could change what they are currently paying for power.4. We discussed all of the above with Peggy Mahoney, and she asked us to take a stab at a comprehensive press release announcing all of the bells and whistles on the new building and our being the 1st Fortune 5000 company to go 1000% green in our headquarters.   Catherine McKalip Thompson is working on the first draft.   We need to determine if we can get the \"best\" press for this commitment (i.e. stories in the WSJ and NY Times).   We determined that the message would need to be targeted, specifying the terms of our commitment...i.e. Enron makes a commitment for 3 years to provide 1000% green for its headquarters in Houston, making it the first Fortune 5000 company to...The goal is to have a final plan and decision by April 20th when Steve speaks to high level executives at a prelude to Earth Day NY on the topic of Energy Shock---Crisis or Opportunity: Building Economics and the Environment.Mike, we'll definitely need your continued support and assistance, particularly if this goes to Skilling.   I'll keep you posted on the progress.Stacey---",

As many of you might know, Enron Wind (Michael Payne) and ENA (Mike Curry) have a great proposal to retire renewable energy credits from our Enron Wind facility to match the consumption of the building and stadium (details attached below).   If this proposal goes forward, Enron would be the 1st Fortune 5000 company to \"go green\" in its headquarters building.   Couple this w/ our energy star award, and we have GREAT environmental messaging.   We'd like to highlight this announcement on Earth Day (April 222nd).The facilities folks are interested in switching from Reliant to EES for actual commodity.   It makes sense to work strategically together on win-win proposal that will not only make sense economically, but that we can use in our messaging.   The focus of the meeting is to discuss the various proposals, and steps for moving forward.   The meeting will be in EB50MO3 from 2:000-3:000.

(NOONISH) ON SUNDAY, JAN.   21An important conference call is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. (PST) on Sunday, Today, Jan 21 to discuss the status of legislative meetings on QF/SRAC matters.   Call-In number is   888-4222-7124Particpant Code is   111756   Status ReportAfter a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored \"deal\" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this morning.   The crux of the deal is as follows: For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ... 7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years [\"all in\", i.e. includes capacity and energy]1.0 on lossesno 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity obligations in the pastApplies \"going forward\" (presumedly Feb. 1)   For gas-fired QFs... 7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;   payment will increase/decrease tied to gas   (this assumes an IER of 9821)1.0 on line lossesapplies \"going forward\"Caacity True-up and \"forbearance\" were not addressed.   Credit worthiness will be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).   This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.   This is essentially the PG&amp;E/QF \"deal\" for the gas guys.   For the renewables, it is more of a fixed payment approach. A \"Technical Conference\" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to work out some of the implementing details.\n"

(the electricity generatio=\rn=20\rmonopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and=20\rexecutives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody.=\r=20\r While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=\r=20\rreport from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=\r=20\rranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20\rResources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen.=20\r Enron Implications\r Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s   478 MW Trakya =\rpower=20\rproject was being investigated.   This has not been reported anywhere else. =\r=20\rBecause the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=\r=20\rpast, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20\ralways a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=\ro=20\rindication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or=20\runderway.\r=20\rGAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=\ral=20\rManager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish=20\rpartner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from=\r=20\rGAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying,=\r=20\rthat his wife has been working at GAMA since 19993, long before Yardim had=\r=20\rrisen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a=\r=20\rgift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number =\rof=20\rnewspaper reports questioning GAMA=01,s role in a controversial gas marketi=\rng=20\rdeal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOT=\rA?.\r Outlook\r It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the mediu=\rm=20\rand long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish=\r=20\ror foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy=\r=20\rdeals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to=20\rresult in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy=20\rsector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low.=20\r We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the=20\rTrakya project, and report as necessary.\n"

I think that Enron should consider joining with these utilities on this.   There may be substantial Enron upside to such a venture from added information disclosure and standardization and streamlining for easier use:On 7/14, FERC issued an Advance NOPR asking for input by 2/15/01 on OASIS Phase II (the new OASIS proposal).   In particular, FERC states that this new OASIS should address: (i) communication of critical market information (like transmission rights); (ii) posting of ATC, TTC, and CBM; and (ii) seams issues between RTOs (transmission service across multiple RTOs).   FERC says that the new OASIS should make use of Internet, interactive displays, etc.   FERC also asks for information on dynamic notification (where the OASIS automatically alerts the customer to changes in ATC, reservations, etc.)   This type of functionality would allow Enron to determine if it wants to stay in a queue when transmission becomes available (rather than getting kicked out after the first denial for lack of ATC.)   FERC also wants information on whether generator-run status should be included on OASIS; electronic scheduling (which can now be done via etag); and business practices that should be standardized.Enron could have significant input to force these utilities to propose a good, customer friendly system that provides valid and helpful data on ATC, TTC, and CBM, rather than the total lack of substantive information that is available today.   (Recall that Enron proposed that CBM use be posted---FERC has not adopted that idea yet.)Because these are critical utilities, any system that they propose may be very likely to be adopted (with some changes).   I think it is better to be in on the front end.   Enron's participation would also give validity to their system.Dan Larcamp told me that he would like more \"classes\" for his staff from Enron and that we should give joint classes with AEP because Susan Tomasky told Dan L. that \"AEP has nothing to hide.\"   This type of venture would allow AEP one venue to make good on that statement.Steve K. asked us to pursue the idea that Enron build a computer system.   This may be a good way to have significant input while leveraging these companies' money and promoting Enron's congestion model ideas, etc.\n"

I would be interested to learn, whether Enron can purchase crude oil from this program (provided that we receive proof that it comes out of the UN program) and whether we are willing to do it (corporate policy).I want to check that out first, before going forward. Next step would be to receive a good level of confidence that the offer is genuine, and then I would talk to the liquids traders.Best regards,Wolfgang\n"

We cannot, per his suggested text, write one letter on behalf of both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling (due to bundling rules we should write two separate letters) and we should put it on personal stationery and not corporate letterhead.

This totals $1000,000 between bothindividuals and the Corporation for the RNSEC matching funds program. We wantthese funds matched in time for the Texas State deadlines. It was ourintention from the onset of this program to have our funds go to thisaccount. The various points of contact from the RNC caused some minorconfusion so checks went to Texas instead of DC. This is very important toMr. Lay and Mr. Shilling.   Let us know if we need to request these funds returned and new checkswritten and mailed to you at your DC address.

Brulte\r   =09\r   Greetings All:\r First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.   Schedule i=\rs=20\rvery tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this=\r=20\rmorning, with some back-up info that I've included below.\r Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f=\ror=20\rdelivery to Sen. Brulte.   It's of course confidential.   Few points:\r I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would=\r=20\rbe appreciated.\rAs we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20\rWednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to \"wallpaper\" Sacramento wi=\rth=20\rour proposed legislation.\rThis email does not contain the legislation.   Mike sent the \"final\" version=\rs=20\rof our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20\rbelieve Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.\rYou'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver =\rto=20\rhis office today the proposed legislation.   Again, based on our call on=20\rWednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed=\r=20\rlegislation to the rest of the world at the same time.\rWhen we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20\rdetermine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same=\r=20\rtime that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will=\r=20\rhandle that end of things.   Please let us know at your convenience to whom=\r=20\ryou've decided to circulate.\rThis email does, however, include a \"summary\" of our proposed legislation. =\r=20\rBut I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20\rappropriate language to distribute \"to the world,\" or if we'll need instead=\r=20\rto tailor some new language.   I think we all agreed that we need a \"one=20\rpager\" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the=\r=20\rpackage effectively.\rWe also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20\rproposals.   We didn't finalize that plan.   Perhaps the Sacramento team coul=\rd=20\rpropose a plan to do that.   Perhaps we could start with our friends in the=\r=20\rDirect Access coalition?\rWe also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the =\rPR=20\rmachinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20\rlegislative package/message.   We're in a meeting with folks today where we=\r=20\rcan discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted=\r=20\rMarathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.\rYou'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR=\r=20\rcredit issue.   As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=\r =20\rYou note that attached to the email is a \"legislative fix\" to AB1X that cou=\rld=20\rsolve the credit issue and an attached set of \"taking points\" related to a=\r=20\rsecond alternative to solving the credit issue:   a PUC order clarifying tha=\rt=20\rDWR will get its money for power purchase costs.\rNote also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to=\r=20\rget the utilities out of the merchant function.   Accordingly, I've put a=20\rbrief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20\r(legislative solution) under the topic \"create a real competitive retail=20\rmarket in California.\"   To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20\rlegislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20\rdiscuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.\r   If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please=\r=20\rdon't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.   I can be best=20\rreached to day by pager at 888.916.7184. =20\r Thanks to all for helping pull this together.\r Best,\rJeff\r ---",

California should ensure that this=\r=20\rrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\rgeneration.   In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\r=20\rinterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\r=20\rthrough executive orders or other regulations.   To the greatest extent=20\rpossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\re=20\rutility and place that control with the California ISO.   This could be=20\raccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\r Permitting and Air Quality Issues\rDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&amp;on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\r or=20\rgreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\rd=20\rtherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\rgeneration faces. =20\r Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-222-01 thru=\r=20\rD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\r=20\routput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&amp;distributed generation=018 facil=\rities.=20\rIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\r=20\rface local opposition.   The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\rinterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\r. =20\rThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\r 3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\r=20\rElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\r Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\r=20\rsuppliers.\rEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\re=20\rgoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\rHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\r=20\rconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\rWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\rredit=20\rrisk concerns.\rEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\r=20\ris working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\r=20\rboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\r=20\rgoing forward.\r Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\r Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority\rThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\rcharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.   From our=\r=20\ranalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\rCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.   =\rAs=20\rsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\res=20\radequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\r Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&amp;Prudence=018\rThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\r=20\rUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\r=20\r=01&amp;imprudent.=018   On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\ruse to=20\rallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\rpurchases.   Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\ree=20\rto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\r=20\rDWR has entered into with suppliers.\r=20\rAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\r=20\rRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\rIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\r=20\rnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\r=20\rthe specific ratemaking =01&amp;mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\roy to=20\rpermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\rs=20\rextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\rre=20\rDWR recovers its power purchase costs.   Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\ris=20\rdifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\r=20\rrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\r=20\rcosts.   Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\r=20\rsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\r=20\rfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\r Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\r We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\rsk=20\rissues.   We have identified three options:\r Amend AB1X\rThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\r=20\rPUC would accept as =01&amp;prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\rred by=20\rDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\rto=20\rensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.   This is the=\r=20\rpreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\r=20\rchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.   (See attached file=20\rentitled, =01&amp;AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\r Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\rthrough Contract Language\rThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\rimplement.   However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\rre=20\rtime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.   We have attached electronic=\r=20\rcopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\r=20\rwould need to issue under this option.   (See attached file entitled,=20\r=01&amp;cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\r Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\rAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\rcept=20\rother forms of credit from DWR.   Those options include a letter of credit,=\r=20\rcash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.   DWR officials have=\r=20\rindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\r=20\rprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\r=20\rcontract amendments.\r 4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 20001\r Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\rAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\r=20\rshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.   They diffe=\rr=20\ronly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.   Al=\rl=20\rcredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\r=20\rof 20001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\rlikely. =20\r CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\rsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\restimates.   California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\r well=20\rbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\rn=20\rin the West.   Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\r=20\rthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\runpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\ro=20\rdate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\rhe=20\rflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\rCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\rthis=20\rrequirement. =20\r Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 20001 include the early=\r=20\rdraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\rre=20\rsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\r=20\rnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\rutilities.   Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\rt=20\rpace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\r=20\radded to correct the market imbalance until 20003 at the earliest.\r CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\r=20\rrolling black outs this summer.   The CEC paints a considerably more=20\roptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\r=20\rMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.   It is our view that California=\r=20\rshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\r 5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\r=01,s=20\rElectricity Crisis\r This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.   We wil=\rl=20\rdeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\r=20\rbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\r As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20\rcrisis must focus on four issues:\r Increase supply\rDecrease demand\rEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\rReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\r Increase supply---Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\rTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\r=20\rEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\r=20\rthan a year.   In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\r The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\rslation=20\rare steps in the right direction.   Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\rse=20\refforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\r=20\rin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\rrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.   Enron=01,s=\r=20\rproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\rtransfering credits between air districts.   In addition, it creates an=20\rinnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\remissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\rir=20\rdistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\rrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\r Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\rBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\r=20\rthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\r=20\rbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.   This can be accomplished mo=\rst=20\reffectively and quickly in two ways:\r Buy-down demand\rCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\rd=20\rto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.   California could likely reduce demand=\r more=20\reconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\rld=20\rbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\r=20\rthrough the summer months).   DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\rdetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.   To=20\rparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\rnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\rreductions.   Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&amp;D=\real=20\rBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\r Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\rTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\r An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\r=20\rfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\rReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\r=20\rverification.\rSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\r=20\rpaid for load reduction (=01&amp;Negawatts=018).\r The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\re:\r =01&amp;creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\rcularly=20\rin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\r=20\rresources.\rreduction of   peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\relectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\rin=20\rthe state.\rfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\rk=20\rof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\rcustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\r=20\rresponding.=20\r We estimate that we could generate a summer 20001 on-peak demand response in=\r=20\rexcess of 4000 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\r=20\rsummer 20002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.   We further estimate=\r=20\rthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\rs=20\rthat amount.   We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\rdirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\rcontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\r Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\rcle:=20\rSB27X\rThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\rre=20\rcustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\r=20\rservice providers.   Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\r=20\rcustomers and businesses.   It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\re=20\rprohibition against Direct Access.\r Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\r=20\rdirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\rf=20\rWater Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\r=20\rcustomer migration. =20\r In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\r=20\rthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.   Procureme=\rnt=20\ris not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\rcondition in which the utilities now find themselves.   California should=20\rtherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\rfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\rnon-utility provider within 36 months.   To execute the transition, Californ=\ria=20\rshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\rin=20\rwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\r=20\rof utility load.\r Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\rvehicle:=20\rAB18X\rUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\r. =20\rIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\rimbalance.   In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\r=20\rand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\ria=20\rState government assume the role of =01&amp;electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\red=20\rperiod of time.   Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\re=20\rin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20\rparticipate in that market.\r California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\r=20\rseries of staged rate increases.   California should design those rate=20\rincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\r=20\r=01&amp;shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\rould=20\ramortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\rd. =20\rIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\r=20\rFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\rrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\rAB=20\r1890.   Second, California can =01&amp;net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\received=20\rfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\re=20\raccrued due to the retail price cap.\r \n"

Monday was a holiday!\rTuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last\rminute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills.\r --- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee.   Thi=\rs\rmeasure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilit=\ry\ras a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction.   The bill also\rplaces the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages fo=\rr\rgeneration units.   Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onl=\ry\rintention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages,\rbut seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner\routlined in the bill.   IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along\rwith CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the California\rCogeneration Council.   The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill=\r.\rOf particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the\ropposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen.   The message from\rthe opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it\rpassed out of the committee on a party-line vote.   IEP is currently\rreassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the\ronly bill that proposes similar changes.\r --- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne,\rwas scheduled this week to hear two siting bills.   The first was AB 34x (La\rSuer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includin=\rg\rsome IEP-sponsored language.   IEP has a support if amended position on the\rbill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable.   Last\rminute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone a\rhearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26).   However, because the Keeley\ramendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill=\r,\rLa Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committee\ranalysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current\rform.\r AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committee\rwith only one =01&amp;no=018 vote.   AB 36x would provide expedited siting for a\rrepower project, as defined.   However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the =\rbill\ramended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects.   Th=\re\rauthor has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental community\rand the CEC to develop language that works for everyone.   IEP=01,s major is=\rsue\rat this point is that is should actually work.   The measure was double\rreferred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will b=\re\rheard there next.\r --- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x\r(Battin).   All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for th=\re\rmeasure.   IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing\rmembers on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure i=\rn\rthe Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing.   Both SCE\rand WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will be\ropposing the bill.\r --- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financing\rauthority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed to\rthe Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next. IEP met with\rSenator Burton=01,s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relat=\ring\rto limiting the Authority=01,s eminent domain powers.   Staff was open to wh=\rat\rwe had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will move\rforward with the bill.   Regardless, IEP will continue to push for amendment=\rs\ron the Assembly side.\r --- SB 333x (Burton), which would require the Governor=01,s plan to purchase =\rthe\rIOU=01,s transmission to be approved first by the Legislature, is still\rawaiting consideration on the Senate floor.\r --- The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status on\rthe negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchas=\re\rof the utilities=01, transmission system.   Reuters is saying there the Gove=\rrnor\rhas a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for $2.76\rbillion.   Negotiations are still going on with PG&amp;E and SDG&amp;E.   More\rinformation on press conference can be found on the Governor=01,s web site.\r ---   Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes\rall the special session bills introduced through yesterday.   Please let me\rknow if you need copies of any of these bills.\r   UPCOMING EVENTS:\r MONDAY, February 26th\rAssembly Natural Resources Committee\r1:45 pm, Room 4447.\rAB 34x (La Suer) =01) makes various changes to the siting process.\r Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee\r1:30 pm, Room 4202.\rAB 38x (Jackson) =01) relates to loan guarantees for renewable energy joint\rventure agreements.\r Senate Environmental Quality Committee\r1:30 pm, Room 4203.\rSB 28x (Sher/Battin) =01) makes various changes to the siting process.\r WEDNESDAY, February 28th\rAssembly Revenue and Taxation Committee\r1:30 pm, Room 126\rAB 45x (Kelley) =01) expands the MIC for certain energy production.\r ---end---\r Julee Malinowski-Ball\rSenior Associate\rEdson + Modisette\r916-5552-7070\rFAX-5552-7075\rjmball@ns.net\r   - 20001 Tracking Report.doc\r\n"

In between the hamburgers, hotdogs, homemade ice cream and occasional dip in the pool that many of you will undoubtedly be enjoying Monday, be sure to take a few minutes to turn your TV set to the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Muscular Dystrophy (MDA) Telethon on NBC.   At 1:10 p.m., Enron's own Linda Jenkins will present a $1000,000 check to Jerry's Houston team.   The donation, which will benefit research for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease --- the disease Linda has been living with for the past three years), was raised by devoted friends and volunteers at the Enron/MDA Beach Bowl held in July.   Thanks to all of you who raised money for this cause that is close to our hearts at Enron.   And have a happy and safe holiday.\n"

In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.   The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.   He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.   Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.   His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.   He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.   He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).

He seemed interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.

In attendance were Ken Lay, the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.   The gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas.   He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.   Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff Dasovich and I prepared.   Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation based on the governor's comments:Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.   His staff has more work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.   He talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level.   He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power (which he estimates at 3000MW).

We discussed the gas price policy, electric deregulation and the role that Enron has been playing and can play in all these matters.I pointed to him that Presidents Bush and Fox were geting together on February 16th and that President Fox has been declaring to the media that he will talk about a common energy policy with President Bush.   We agreed that it would be useful for Secretary Martens to Meet with Dr. Lay before the Presidents meet.   Fernando Alonso admitted to me today that Secretary Martens wanted to hear Mr. Lays opinion on this subject and perhaps recieve some advice with respect to talking points for President Fox with President Bush regarding energy policy.Secretary   Marten's   team(and now the Secretary himself) view Mr. Lay as an ideal communication link between the Mexican and the U.S. Governments for energy policy.   This is the reason why the Secretary wants to meet with Mr. Lay before the 16th.   Originally they had agreed on meeting on Feb. 12th at 9:000 a.m. Nevertheless, President Fox has asked that Secretary Martens to meet him in Mexico City on Monday the 12th which is why I got a call from Fernando Alonso asking if Mr. Lay could see Secretary Martens on Sunday the 111th between 3:000 p.m. and 6:30 p.m.   Secretary Martens has to be at a CERA dinner on Sunday at 7:000 p.m.Fernando Alonso, Dionisio Perez-Jacome, Undersecretary Niceforo Guerrero and myself will be meeting tomorrow at 10:000 a.m. to talk about electric deregulation.   They are expecting an answer from me by then.Dionisio Perez-Jacome president of the CRE (FERC equivalent) is going to be in Houston on Monday the 12th.   I would like you and Steve Kean to meet with him if you are going to be in town.   I would also like to organize a tour for him that day.   We'll talk about this tomorrow night when I see you.Thanks for your support.Ricardo\n"

Generally, I don't see=\r=20\rthe FERC having any problem with mechanical, electrical, air-conditioning=\r=20\rtypes of services.   However; there are 2 specific concerns that arise with=\r=20\rrespect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate=\r=20\rstandards of conduct:\r 1. Records --- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate \"access\" to=\r=20\rtransportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file=\r=20\rroom access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a=\r=20\rmarketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me tha=\rt=20\rEES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function=\r=20\rfor NNG, TW or NBPL.\r 2. Billing -   FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.   In a recent=\r=20\rKinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge=\r=20\rrecords to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not=\r=20\roperate separately.   It would be helpful if any EES facility management=20\rcharges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) ---   leaving=\r=20\rus room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate=\r=20\rfunctions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate.\r   =20\r=09\r=09\r=09From:   Steve Kean &amp; Bill Donovan   111/14/2000 06=\r:36 PM\r=09\r Sent by: Enron Announcements\rTo: All Enron Houston\rcc: =20\r Subject: Reorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management=20\rResponsibilities\r   Responsibility   for daily operations of building support services in the=20\rEnron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will =\rbe=20\rtransitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.

Other changes have also been implemented.   Please send a Notes mail to \"Bill Myers\" if you notice any problems, particularly if you think that they might be conversion or program related.   (I already know about the company description for the MSA spreadsheets where companies are rebooked to themselves).Attached   are spreadsheets with the detail supporting the expenses for telephones, data ports, EDI, Enterprise LAN, Enterprise Help Desk, video conferencing, Internet access, email, and other services provided to Enron business units by Enron Information Services.   These expenses are posted in MSA Detail Class 845.EIS billings for items attached to the room, such as phones and data ports, and people specific services for contractors, such as LAN ID's and AT&amp;T calling cards, are billed to the same company and cost center as room rent in EB or 3AC.   For Omaha, EIS uses a phone database maintained by Tammy Anderson for this purpose.   People specific services for employees are billed to the company and cost center corresponding to the employee's HR company and department. Video conference usage, data circuits, Ardmore usage, EDI, and web site billings are based on a company and cost center furnished by the person requesting the service.EIS bills services on a one month lag.   We take a snapshot of the Corporate Administrative Services rent file for each room in EB and 3AC, of the Omaha phone database for each room in Omaha, and of the HR company and department for each employee.   This snapshot is taken at the end of each month for use as a source for billing information.   Please examine these billings for accuracy.   If our billings are incorrect, generally speaking either the rent should be corrected by contacting Corporate Administrative Services or the person should be moved to the correct HR department by contacting your HR representative.   If the room number is incorrect on the phone or long distance billings, this may be corrected by sending the room number along with the telephone number to Notes Mail ID \"Move-Team\".If you wish to move EIS charges after to a different company and/or department after billings have been processed or if you wish to discuss an alternative to using your HR department for people specific billings, please send a message to Notes Mail ID \"EIS Billing\".\n"

Now, also facing blackouts, they want to tilt balance of power away from the Golden State and toward themselves.By PETER G. GOSSELIN, Times Staff Writer   WINTERSBURG, Ariz.---For more than a century, California ran a simple account with the rest of the West: It demanded and the West supplied, most especially water and power.   But as the Western states have ballooned in the last decade---in no small part because of an outbound trek of Californians---this simple, supply-demand relationship has broken down.   Fundamentally, the rest of the West has outgrown its electrical system just as California has its own. And it has done so in very much the same way---by adding too many people without enough new power or conservation.   Indeed, statistics show that much of the rest of the West would have been on the verge of trouble even without California's help and may yet face the sort of rolling blackouts that have wreaked so much havoc in the Golden State.   The booming Southwest has run its power grid at such a fever pitch that its planning reserves---the extra power that utilities build in to handle emergencies---have shrunk to levels that many regulators and industry experts consider dangerous.   Almost none of the West save Montana has increased its power production at anything like the pace of its population growth during the last decade. Despite the long economic boom of the 19990s, which smiled especially on the West, several, such as Arizona, have failed to complete a single new power plant.   \"We don't know how bad it's going to be yet,\" said Utah's Republican governor, Mike Leavitt. \"We won't know that until May, June, July and August, when everyone in the Southwest turns on their swamp coolers.\"   In trying to dodge the blackout bullet, many Western leaders are seeking to force a great change on the region: to renegotiate their states' basic deal with California. They want to end an old relationship---that between center and hinterland, colonizer and colonized---and establish a new one that could curtail California's long regional dominance.   In the strange chemistry of the moment---when a once-Republican state government has turned Democratic and a once-Democratic national government has turned Republican, when the battle is to a large extent over privately owned electricity rather than publicly controlled water---they could actually meet with some success.   \"California spent the 20th century decolonizing itself from Wall Street and the East,\" said Kevin Starr, the state librarian and author of a multivolume history of California. \"Now, all of a sudden, there's a dramatic possibility of it being recolonized, at least in part, by the rest of the West.\"   Captive Plants Feed Power to California   Ground zero for these changes lies 50 miles west of Phoenix in the dry scrublands of Wintersburg. This is home to the Palo Verde nuclear facility, now the nation's single biggest power producer. It will soon be home as well to between three and six new gas-fired power plants that, combined, will produce even more electricity than their giant neighbor.   Palo Verde represents a great deal about the old, fraying world of regulated utilities and about the supply-demand relationships that California once maintained with the rest of the West.   More than one-quarter of the plant is owned by Los Angeles' municipal utility, the Department of Water and Power, several other California cities and Southern California Edison.   A row of steel latticework towers runs off toward California, carrying a transmission line from plant to consumer. California has big stakes in a half-dozen similarly captive plants in an arc of states from Nevada to New Mexico.   From California's point of view, the beauty of these projects has been that they provided near-certain power without the muss of meeting state pollution standards or the political hassle of building closer to home.   And at least until the mid-19990s, California regulators virtually guaranteed that their owners covered their costs and made profits, even if plants' power wasn't immediately needed.   \"The first principle of the old system was that you had to be able to meet demand, no matter what,\" said Paul L. Joskow, a veteran utility economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   \"If you had too much power, if it cost you a little too much, that was less important than being sure you could meet demand.\" And, he added, \"you had regulators watching to make sure you did.\"   The gas-fired plants that are about to pop up in Wintersburg are also representative, but of the new, deregulated world of power production. Although they will crowd in around Palo Verde and tap into the same California transmission line, they are being built on an entirely different business premise: selling power to the highest bidder.   In fact, the reason this empty patch of desert has become such an electricity hot spot lately is not Palo Verde itself, but its huge transmission lines. In addition to the California line, four others fan out from the plant: two back to Phoenix, one east to New Mexico, and one north to Utah and from there to the Northwest.   All were built to hard-wire the nuclear project to its owners. But they are now seen as the means by which a new breed of producer can get top dollar by sending power wherever prices are highest.   \"It used to be generating capacity was built by people who looked at the market to see if they could meet demand,\" said Jack Davis, president of Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which owns Arizona's major utility and is putting up two of the Wintersburg plants.   \"Now,\" he said approvingly, \"it's being built by people who look at the market to see if you can make a lot of money.\"   Plans Go Awry in Many States   Money, not the watchful eye of government, was what was supposed to assure that electricity deregulation worked. The opportunity to make it would cause investors to flock to the electricity business, ensuring that plenty of new power plants got built.   If too many went up, it would be investors, not ratepayers, who suffered. If too few, then high prices would attract still more investors, more plants and, ultimately, more power.   But to date, almost nothing about deregulation has gone as planned---and not just in California, but in the West in general.   Take Arizona. The state has a hands-off attitude toward business, including its utilities. It has almost none of the environmental restrictions blamed for keeping California from putting up the new plants it needs.   Its population grew by 40% from 19990 to 2000, according to the Census Bureau. And its demand for electricity expanded at nearly twice that rate, according to industry figures.   \"Arizona should have been a power producer's heaven,\" said A. Michael Schaal, a senior analyst with Energy Ventures Analysis Inc., a prominent Washington-area consulting firm.   But Arizona's power production rose a mere 4% during the 19990s, mostly as a result of improving existing plants. Until 18 months ago, no one had applied to build a major power plant since Palo Verde in the late 1980s.   \"I guess I go on the assumption that the utilities plan with some sort of 10-, 20-, 30-year time horizon,\" Arizona's Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull said in a recent interview. \"I think what we all worry about is: Are they planning?\"   Or Nevada. Its utilities apparently did plan and increased electricity-making capacity between 19990 and 2000 by a substantial 444%. But that wasn't enough to keep up with the state's population, which increased 666%. On Thursday, Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn, a Republican and former energy company executive, indefinitely halted deregulation in his state.   Or traditionally energy-rich Washington state. One of its major utilities, Seattle City Light, recently learned that all of its previously planned supply increase for the next four years will be consumed, and then some, by just three new customers: computer server farms being built to handle the growing Internet traffic in and out of the high-tech capital.   But it's unlikely to be able to get extra power soon because regional supplies are balanced on a \"razor's edge,\" according to Northwest Power Pool President Jerry Rust. \"We have no cushion.\"   Indeed, the electricity supplies of the entire West are balanced on a razor's edge, with a variety of forecasters predicting serious shortages this summer.   Schaal, the Washington-area consultant, for example, said the region will come up 6% short. \"Westerners can expect 150 to 275 hours of rolling blackouts, most of them in California,\" he said.   One of the most striking aspects of the current situation is that, in contrast to what most people think, supplies have not grown short just recently.   They have been perilously tight for the last several years---before the start of California's troubles of this summer and fall, and before the near-record dry winter that has left the Northwest dangerously short of water for its hydroelectric dams.   The implication is that California did not cause other states to run short of power so much as trigger events that exposed their danger. It did that, according to key observers, with one monumentally inept maneuver.   When California required its major utilities to buy power in the volatile spot market and simultaneously prohibited them from passing along higher costs to consumers, it set off a furious price spiral.   That effectively stripped the entire region of its energy security blanket, the assurance that it could buy extra power relatively inexpensively if local supplies proved inadequate.   The result has been a string of crises across the West.   In southern Arizona, for example, the San Carlos Irrigation Project, a tiny public utility that tried to jump into the deregulation vanguard by dropping long-term contracts in hopes of more power at lower prices in the spot market, has announced that its bills are going up 3000%. Most of the project's 13,3000 poor customers say they can't pay.   In Phoenix, utility executives who had confidently said the state was rich with new power projects about to come on line have decided to pull two 50-year-old steam plants out of mothballs and rent a pair of portable generators to reduce purchases from the expensive spot market.   In Idaho, the big power company is appealing to potato farmers to skip planting and sell the electricity they would use running irrigation pumps back to the firm. Company executives figure the buyback will be cheaper than purchasing power on the open market---and the potato farmers are likely to do pretty well themselves.   Deep Hostility in Rest of the West   The subtle difference between California's triggering recent events and actually causing the region's crisis is largely lost in the current atmosphere of apprehension and upheaval. Although leaders of the rest of the West are scrupulously evenhanded in commenting to outsiders about their big neighbor, they are less guarded at home.   The normally mild-mannered Leavitt, for example, was recently quoted as warning a Salt Lake City audience that \"California, if given the chance, would put a shunt into our veins and bleed us pretty quickly.\" (In an interview, he denied having made the remark.)   Such comments reflect an old and easily rekindled view among Westerners that their states are, in the words of historian Bernard DeVoto, \"plundered provinces\"---terrain that first Easterners and then Californians have regularly raided for minerals, water and, most recently, power.   But this time, some Western leaders think they can change all this. \"A lot of people see an opportunity to rewrite the fundamental relationship with California to their advantage,\" said Stanford historian Richard White.   The attempts at rewriting are taking shape across the West.   In the Northwest, Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana are redoubling their efforts to take over the Bonneville Power Administration, the huge, federally controlled generating system on the Columbia and Snake rivers that is one of California's chief sources of summer electricity.   \"The crisis has highlighted the danger that power generated in the region can be exported without the region's consent,\" Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said in an interview.   In Arizona, state officials have gone from having no proposals for new power plants to being buried by them. Regulators recently approved the construction of 10 plants, including several around Palo Verde, and are considering another eight.   Although they are requiring the plants to temporarily serve Arizona's needs first, the facilities will soon be able to sell their power for whatever prices they can command, an arrangement that could leave California just one among many bidders.   (Federal officials are unlikely to get in the way: Gov. Hull is close to President Bush, who in turn has shown little interest in helping Democratic California.)   Perhaps the most aggressive efforts at change are occurring in Utah, where Leavitt is trying something that could become California's worst nightmare---recalling power that Utah produces for the state.   Los Angeles' DWP and several other California utilities own three-quarters of the huge, coal-fired Intermountain Power Project in west-central Utah, and have been drawing on it without incident for 15 years.   But Utah officials recently unearthed a long-forgotten provision in their agreement with the plant's owners that gives them the right, with proper notice, to recall power for local use.   The state has already notified Los Angeles that it is taking back 50 megawatts of electricity capacity this summer and another 170 next summer, and it may be able to take back still more, according to plant general manager Reed Searle.   Although the amounts are trivial---the Los Angeles utility either owns or has firm contracts for more than 7,000 megawatts of capacity---Leavitt said Utah will demand similar recall provisions in agreements for any new plants in the state, including a 5000- to 750-megawatt facility that Los Angeles is negotiating to build.   \"California has chosen not to create its own power generation and has depended on us to do that,\" the Utah governor said. \"That's fine and we're willing to do that.   \"But,\" he added, \"there comes a point at which, if demand grows too large, we've got to hold some of this capacity back for ourselves, and for our children and grandchildren.\"   If Utah and the rest of the West have reached that point, California could be in for a much bigger and more enduring shock than the one from which it now suffers.---   Times researcher Lynn Marshall in Seattle contributed to this report.Copyright 20001 Los Angeles Times   \n"

He also had a significant role in the drafting of the Japanese version of the contract.kind regards\tMorten E Pettersen\tSent by: Morten E Pettersen\t01/30/20001 03:13 PM \t\t\t To: Enron Japan, Enron Metals Tokyo\t\t\t cc: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: NCC Power Deal - First electricity transactionDear all,Enron Japan did today their first power transaction, and the first power derivative transaction ever in Japan. The counterpart is Nippon Chemi-Con Kabushiki Kaisha (NCC).The term of the deal is 01/04/02-31/3/06, with a yearly volume of around 1110,000 MWhThe basic structure of the electricity transaction is that Enron Japan gives the counterpart a 6,8% discount on their actual electricity bill for the period 1/4/01-31/3/02. This discount, or the option premium, gives Enron the right but not the obligation to supply NCC with Electricity for the 4 yearly supply terms starting 1/4/02, 1/4/03, 1/4/04 and 1/4/05 at predefined prices. If Enron Japan decide to supply NCC with Electricity for a specific supply term, we need to inform them 2 months before the start of the supply term. This structure give Enron Japan the necessary flexibility to operate in a newly deregulated electricity market.The deal was closed by Morten Erik Pettersen with very good support from Rousseau Anai (Associate Power Trading) and Jane McBride (Senior Legal Counsel)RegardsMorten Erik Pettersen Head of TradingEnron Japan Corp\n"

But he also said there is a right way and a wrong way to do it.   Enron and others had provided a market based answer by offering a fixed price deal to SDG&amp;E (which would have enabled them to cap rates to those who had not switched.   California elected instead to cap rates and deficit spend (ie create a deferral account).   I don't think we can stand for anything that doesn't protect the small customers, but we can continue to emphasize the market based solutions.   One of the messages in my testimony will be: customers should be encouraged to choose.   Those who did are doing fine.\n"

Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to act.Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime.\n"

Privatizations and restructuring activity continue apace.   Governments faced with burgeoning power demands, but lacking the   funds to meet them, are nearly universally opening their generation   markets to foreign investors, even where privatization is not on the   agenda.   More and more, state-owned utilities are unbundling.   Competition is being introduced into national markets at both the   wholesale and retail levels.   A few international players have scaled   back their international investments and shifted substantial portions   of their portfolio to less risky markets, such as the U.S. or Europe.   Competition in Europe has been spurred by the EU Directive.   As Asian   economies recover, most governments are starting to move forward   again with unbundling / restructuring plans.   After a year in which   currency devaluations caused a number of early investors to exit   Latin America, a healthier economy has allowed privatizations to   restart, but at a slower pace.   This mailing summarizes recent developments in Europe, Asia-Pacific,   Latin America, and the Middle East / Africa. Maps that summarize the   status of restructuring in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa   and the Middle East are attached as Exhibits 1-4.   A slippery slope   is Exhibit 5.   Timelines showing the opening of markets in various   countries, by region, are in Exhibits 6-8.   (See attached file: Intlmail 3 exhibits.ppt)   February '999 marked the opening of the market to choice for most   large EU customers who use over 40 GWh a year.   This accounts for   about a fourth of demand.   As of \"E-Day\", neither France nor Italy   had passed their proposed enabling legislation.   While the EU   intended for the transmission operator to be independent, EDF intends   to retain control over the grid, as will ENEL.   A phased deregulation   of the gas industry began to unfold in similar fashion beginning in   August 2000.   Mergers, alliances, and consolidation are a dominant theme as   companies jockey for position in the new European power market.   There is a tremendous opportunity for international players to cross   borders: as suppliers of new generation, as purchasers of assets   being spun off by liberalization decrees (Italy) or because of market   concentration rulings in mergers (Germany, Spain). Several   international companies have opened trading offices in Europe, or   (   Enron, Reliant, Southern, TXU).   HoustonStreet.com launched a   European online wholesale energy-trading platform.   ?   Austria:   Austria's liberalizing market is facing problems   from within and without.   The EU is dissatisfied with its   lack of G-T-D unbundling, although accounts were formally   separated in 1999.   There is no ISO.   Internally, there is   intense discussion about an accelerated market opening   (customers over 20 GWh now have choice). Regional utilities   are angry over the Verbund's proposal to open 1000% of the   market in late 20001. The Verbund, a 51% SOU, is the largest   generator and owns the transmission grid. However, it has no   retail customers and hence is strongly exposed to already   deregulated wholesale customers. (C.B. White, Judith Lezaun)   ?   Denmark: The 1999 liberalization law exceeds the EU   directive's goals and establishes full retail access by 20003.   Choice was phased in for large industrials using more than   1000 GWh in 19997;   the threshold dropped in April '000 more   than 10 GWh; the next threshold drops to 1GWh at the end of   2000. The new law includes unbundling of distribution   activity and regulated TPA. Denmark has recently experienced   a consolidation wave in generation that leaves the sector   with 2 large incumbents. The trend is moving downstream into   distribution and supply. Western Denmark is already part of   the Nordic power exchange NordPool and East Denmark is due to   join by the end of 2000. Energy policy aims at twenty percent   of electricity sales would come from renewables by the end of   20003, up from a current 10%. (Cecilia Bergman)   ?   Finland: Finland has been fully open to choice since   September 19998, when a metering requirement was dropped.   Prices immediately dropped, but only about 2-3% of households   have switched supplier. Finland forms part of the Nordic   power exchange NordPool. The regulator monitors distribution   tariffs and a rTPA regime is in place. In November '98, the   Finnish government launched an IPO for 20% of Fortum, the   holding company for the merger of utility Imatran Voima Oy   and oil and gas company Neste Oy. The Finnish government   expects to lower its ownership further. The largest new   entrant in the market is Swedish Vattenfall, with its   acquisitions of distributors and some generation capacity.   Further M&amp;A in the distribution and supply sector is   expected. (Cecilia Bergman)   ?   France: There was irony in France's push for liberalization   as it assumed its six-month EU presidency.   France passed   its electricity law last February, a year after required by   EU directive, but had 30-odd implementation decrees stalled   in the National Assembly.   However, EDF, which still controls   more than 95% of French generation, realized Brussels would   hinder its foreign ambitions if its domestic market remained   closed. It recently convinced French authorities to open up   34% of the market by the end of 2000 instead of 20003,   lowering the eligibility threshold to 9 GWh/year (from 16   GWh). EDF is also aware that its monopoly prevents it from   easily entering the energy services market   --- leading EDF to   promote a \"relatively rapid\" total opening of the French   market. (Corinne Aigroz, White)   ?   Germany:   While the Electricity Law was officially effective   in April '98, real competition is still impeded by   complicated TPA grid access conditions, especially on the   retail market. A group of new entrants has organized to call   for a governmental regulator.   Some recent studies have shown   the cost of electricity so low on some bills as to indicate a   \"massive cross-subsidization between network operations and   marketing.\" Recent charges have been made of obstacles to   competition by a mulitiplicity of fees, including customer   switching charges and supplier entrants registration levies.   In the last 12 months, M&amp;A among big national and   international utilities has redrawn the German utility   landscape: EDF bought a share in EnBW, Veba / Viag merged to   form EON and RWE/VEW merged into RWE. Furthermore, RWE and   EON must sell their stakes in VEAG due to antitrust   authority.   Currently, several utilities are and battling for   control of East German VEAG, whose transmission connections   make it a portal to Eastern Europe.   (Judith Lezaun, White)   ?   Greece: According to the FT, Greece has \"hired a consultant\"   (us) to produce a 5-year plan for state utility PPC.   PPC is   preparing an IPO for 15-20% of the company, theoretically set   for 20001, but likely later.   Greece has been given until 20001   by the EU to conform to the Directive. An IEA report   suggested two major swift changes to the energy sector   structure.   First, the government should create a clearer   separation between itself and the state-owned PPC, including   a separate regulatory agency.   Second, the government should   consider splitting the PPC into competing generators to   maximize competition, as well as improving market access   conditions for IPPs and cogenerators.   As the country's   largest employer, PPC is not likely to effect these changes   quickly. (White, Thomas Read)   ?   Ireland: Supply competition was introduced in February '000   for customers over 4 GWh (28% of the market).   Opening is   scheduled to increase to 32% in 20003, with further   liberalisation in 20006.   No date for mid-market and full   retail opening has been set.   Incumbent ESB plans to split   off its transmission business, which will remain state-owned.   Competition in generation will be introduced in 20002 with the   auctioning of ESB capacity, which is intended to create at   least two new players.   Independent power production has been   allowed for two years now. (Ben Joyce)   ?   Italy:   Italy approved its market deregulation decree in   March '999; in some measures, it goes beyond the EU Directive.   ENEL had dominated 80% of generation; by 20003, no entity can   control more than 50%, or 30% by 20005.   This requires that   ENEL sell between 15GW and 222GW of its 57GW by 20003.   It has   separated G-T-D into separate legal entities and been 34.5%   privatized.   A second tranche should take place in 20001.   A   pool mechanism should be operating by 20001.   Consortia of   industrials using more 30GWh/year can contract directly with   IPPs; by 20002, the threshold will be 9GWh/ year. The   potential free market currently amounts to 80 TWh a year, or   30% of total demand.   This will increase to 40% in 20002.   ENEL, who has a de facto monopoly on T&amp;D, will retain   ownership of the national grid assets; a separate state-run   ISO, GRTN, will run transmission and dispatching.   A pool   mechanism, operated by a GRTN subsidiary, should be operating   by 20001; in the meantime, the market uses bilateral   contracts. (Valentina Grifo, White)   ?   Netherlands:   By June '000 three of the four large generation   companies had been sold to foreign energy groups.   Competition for large industrial users began in August '98.   Large industrials (333% of the market) can currently choose   their supplier.   By 20002, 58% of the market will be   competitive, and in 20004, there will be full customer choice.   The Amsterdam Power Exchange, modeled along Scandinavian   lines, was launched in May '999.   The APX allows players to   trade power over the Internet on an hourly basis for the next   day.   In April '000, it added day-ahead prices at border   points for Germany, although it is not yet much used; if   successful, Belgium would follow. In October '000, the   government agreed to buy the entire high voltage network,   TenneT, from the four generation companies for $999.1 million.   Their goal was to improve the supply market and to increase   real competition. (White, Karel Tutein Nolthenius)   ?   Norway:   Norway opened up to retail access in one fell swoop   in 19991. \"Real\" retail access got started in 19995 when the   meter requirement was abolished; switching got started in   19997 when a switching fee was canceled.   The current   accumulated switching rate lies at 14%. Distribution tariffs   are regulated and transparent according to rTPA. Norway forms   part of NordPool. (Cecilia Bergman)   ?   Portugal: Portugal brought new regulations into force in   January '999.   They include a price-cap system for determining   tariffs and the creation of two coexisting supply systems:   public and independent.   Each is locked into supplying the   national grid (REN), a regulated and EdP-owned monopoly.   Producers within the independent system can currently supply   eligible customers who consume more than 9GWh/year at a   single site.   The country's four discos may purchase up to 8%   of consumption outside the public system.   Portugal's   regulator, ERSE, needs either to extend the eligible   customers or raise the allowed percent for discos in order to   reach the percents required by the Directive.   The government   sold another stake of 20% of state-owned Electricidade de   Portugal in October '000, following two successful offerings   in '97 and '98.   This offering raised $1.34 billion.   The   state retains 32.6% and \"golden share\" voting rights. (Rui de   Sousa)   ?   Spain: After several major Latin American purchases, Endesa   moved to restructure and consolidate at home, announcing in   October '000 the merger with Iberdrola.   The resulting company   would have 80% of the market, so it would be forced to shed   generation and distribution assets.   It would also create the   world's 4th largest utility, by market cap. There is also   movement with the smaller two players.   The Spanish regulator is applying an eligibility schedule   faster than the minimum requirements of the EU Directive   providing for full market opening by January 20003. Several   foreign players are already authorized to supply eligible   consumers and there are new generation capacity additions   announced by some of the large international. Nearly 60% of   the market can now choose its supplier.   A mandatory pool   with a bidding system started in Jan '98. (White, Dominguez)   ?   Sweden: Deregulation was introduced in January '96 with full   retail access to all customer groups, rTPA and unbundling of   distribution activities. However, switching was impeded by a   meter requirement that was abolished in November '999.   Switching is currently at 10% but with renegotiated contracts   the figure is more like 25%. Sweden forms part of NordPool, a   \"common electricity market\", a forum for physical and   financial exchanges. Alongside NordPool is a bilateral market   and an OTC market for financial trading. Consolidation has   occurred in the distribution sector mainly and the generation   market is concentrated in the hands of 3 large actors.   (Cecilia Bergman)   ?   Switzerland: In October '000, Parliament passed an electricity   market law.   The first phase of the liberalization should   start in 20001 granting choice to large industrials (&lt; 20   GWh); the mid-size market will open in 20004 (&lt; 10 GWh). In   20007, the law envisions a fully open market. Some aspects of   the new law, such as the transmission tariff model, are still   being discussed. (Chris Brombacher, White)   ?   UK: With market deregulation complete (full choice since May   1999), the UK market is now settling into a phase of supply   consolidation.   Seven of the 12 RECs in England &amp; Wales are   now in joint ownership.   In the generation market, the   incumbent's share continues to decline: National Power and   PowerGen have divested further capacity, and now stand at   8.5% and 6.7%.   The New Electricity Trading Arrangements for wholesaling have   been postponed to early 20001.   They will allow for a futures   and forwards market to trade alongside the established spot   market.   Markets will be run by independent members, although   the balancing and settlement mechanism will be run by a   system operator as before.   A bilateral power exchange will   also be put in, and is expected to handle a much larger   demand than the spot market. (Ben Joyce)   In Central and Eastern Europe, privatization initiatives are   continuing to attract badly needed capital, while the IMF urges   reforms as a condition for funding.   Countries that are looking to EU   membership have moved forward with power sector restructuring and   gradual opening of their markets to choice.   ?   Bulgaria: In January, the Energy Agency announced its intent   to unbundle the state monopoly, NEK, into separate G-T-D   companies.   NEK will remain a single buyer; 28 distribution   entities have been merged into seven new companies.   The   unions are opposing rapid reform, claiming the necessary   regulations have not yet been written.   The government is   working with the IMF to set up financial controls and   eliminate cross-subsidies.   Between 20001 and 20005, all   generation will be upgraded or privatized.   Transmission will   remain state-owned.   (Csilla Ilkei, White)   ?   The Czech Republic: In October '000, the Czech government   announced it would sell a strategic stake in generator CEZ   and in six of the eight regional distributors to a single   buyer. Privatization is expected to begin in 20001.   Many   Western companies, such as Vattenfall and E.On have already   been quietly buying up stakes in small municipal distributors   who need the cash to balance their budgets. A new energy law   should be also approved by the end of 2000, which would open   power markets to competition between 20002 and 20006; prices   should reflect costs by 20002.   Gas liberalization will follow   in 20005.   CEZ is testing its controversial nuclear plant,   Temelin, which should begin operating by spring 20001. CEZ   plans to cut wholesale electricity prices by 20% after the   commercial launch of Temelin. (Kristina Kalinova, White)   ?   Hungary: Since December '95, majority shares have been sold   in the six regional discos and five gencos to Western   investors.   Eastern Europe's   earliest and most ambitious   privatization program has fallen victim to a host of   problems, especially central government price control.   AES   and IVO-Tomen tendered new capacity tendered in 1999, but AES   is now bringing MVM to arbitration over its failure to sign   its agreed-on PPA.   Hungary will partially deregulate its   market after 20002 but before it joins the EU. Further   privatization opportunities include a coal-fired power plant   as well as the monopoly transco, MVM. (Cs. Ilkei, White)   ?   Moldova: The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development   has expressed an interest in stakes in privatized assets of   Modova, giving privatization scheduled for this year a boost.   Majority shares will be sold in first in five distribution   companies, then in three generators. The first attempt to   privatize distribution failed to receive timely bids.   All   companies will require substantial investment for upgrades.   (White)   ?   Romania: In September '000, the national electric company,   Conel, was split into four independent units. These encompass   fossil generation, hydro generation, transmission, and   distribution and metering. Restructuring precedes eventual   privatization, which will begin with distribution, followed   by generation.   Current law requires foreign owners to have a   local partner.   As Romania is one of the countries invited to   join accession talks with the EU, it is opening its market in   stages.   Currently, 10% (&lt;1000GWh) has choice; this will rise   to 45% (&lt;40GWh) next year.   Evenually, elegibility thresholds   will be lowered to 20GWh, then 9GWh. (Cs. Ilkei,White)   ?   Russia: In the mid-19990s, the Unified Energy Systems of   Russia Joint Stock Company (UES; also known as RAO), was   organized into 72 regional joint stock companies; UES still   holds 49% shares in most of these regional utilities.   In May   '000, President Putin fired the non-reformist energy minister   who had blocked earlier attempts at privatization and   liberalization.   The new minister is an unknown quantity.   The head of UES has wanted to privatize significant portions   of UES and to lift foreign ownership controls, currently at   25%. (White)   ?   Slovak Republic: In October 2000 the government approved a   plan to restructure and partially privatize its energy   sector; implementation legislation needs to be passed.   The   plan would see state-owned Slovenske Elektrarne (the G-T-D   monopoly) transformed into a 1000% state-owned joint stock   company.   Regional distributors will be separated from SE   and merged in the first half of 20001 into three joint-stock   companies, with a 49% block of shares to be sold.   Generation   will also be separated and transformed into joint stock   companies. Municipalities will acquire majority stakes in the   heating plants.   The government will select a privatization   adviser for SE and for the distribution companies in early   20001. (Kristina Kalinova)   ?   Turkey: The controversy over BOO (build-own-operate) vs. BOT   (build-operate-transfer) arrangements for IPPs was resolved   in January 2000.   Turkey passed a retroactive constitutional   amendment allowing international arbitration for energy   contracts.   Twenty-three BOT projects are affected.   Turkish   economic growth is fueling a need to triple its capacity to   64 GW by 2010.   In September, Turkey proposed an energy law   that would separate state-owned TEAS into separate G-T-D   entities.   Generation plants would eventually be available   for privatization, while new plants would no longer be   transferred to the government, but remain with the IPP   builder.   The impetus for this proposed law is Turkey's   interest in EU membership; only 1/8th of its 120 energy   regulations meets EU standards.   (White)   ?   Ukraine:   Authorities have announced the sale of seven of the   country's 27 regional discos, in a transparent tender.   Such   a sale has been unsuccessfully tried before.   Each sale will   be for 25% plus one share. The distribution sector is beset   with a host of problems including high non-payment, unpaid   employees, and corruption.   The EBRD is pushing for progress   on privatization before it provides funds to build an   alternative to Chernobyl, which the authorities have agreed   to close.   Asian economies are recovering from the economic crisis and in some   countries electricity demand is returning to pre-crisis levels.   Most   governments are starting to move forward again with unbundling /   restructuring plans in the power sector; although IPPs are facing   ongoing problems relating to PPAs and lack of government guarantees.   ?   Australia:   All customers in Australia should have choice by   20003.   Victoria will to phase in full competition during   20001.   New South Wales (NSW) has delayed full competition for   residential users and small businesses to January '02.   The   five other states plan to phase in full choice by 20003.   Victoria's five distributors are facing revenue reductions of   between 12% and 222% starting in 20001, whey they say will hurt   their service capability.   Recent M&amp;A activity has seen   already- privatized Victorian distribution, retail, and   transmission change hands, with new owners coming from Asia.   ElectraNet, South Australia's (SA) transco, was sold as a   2000-year lease in September.   The National Electricity   Market, comprising Victoria and NSW, started operating in   December '999.   Queensland, SA and ACT will join in the next   few years.   ?   China:   China is aiming for nationwide interconnection,   including Hong Kong, by 2010. Power pooling and increased   interconnection is being tested in Zhejiang and Shanghai   provinces.   As there is no process or body in place to   oversee reforms, some believe that sector reform is a mere   slogan. Investors are backing off of a number of planned IPPs   following a government decision to cap the ROR for new   projects at 10%.   Another issue is lack of government   guarantees.   China plans to build hundreds of small rural   hydro projects and to spend Yn555bn to upgrade rural power   grids in 2000 as part of a project to bring electricity to 75   million people who currently have no access.   ?   India:   Five of India's 19 states have undertaken significant   reforms: Orissa, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and   Uttar Pradesh.   And, only four of the State Electricity   Boards (SEBs), the principal buyers for independent power,   are profitable.   IPP builders have been frustrated by a host   of regulations, lack of guarantees, and SEB insolvencies.   The growing Indian power deficit was dramatically highlighted   this year by the withdrawal of two major investors, EdF and   Cogentrix.   A draft \"Electricity Bill 2000\" will be introduced in   Parliament this winter.   It would create and empower   autonomous State Electricity Regulation Commissions.   SEBs   would be unbundled into G-T-D and corporatized within four   months of passage.   Initially, states would initially retain   G&amp;D assets; they would later be privatized.   Transmission   assets would be put under an independent authority, and TPA   would be allowed.   Significantly, IPP licensing requirements   would be clarified and reduced, and largely eliminated for   the growing segment of captive producers.   A key problem of   theft ? as high as 30% of T&amp;D losses in some areas ? would be   addressed by strict metering and high penalties.   The   likelihood, however, of the Bill being passed as proposed is   not strong, as it faces significant opposition both by unions   and regional parties in Parliament.   ?   Indonesia:   Indonesia's IPP program has faced problems over   power purchase costs and project rates of return, with   bankrupt state-owned PLN claiming it is unable to pay IPP   operators for power.   Of 27 planned IPP projects, only three   now supply power; six others are ready to generate.   PLN   reached an interim agreement with Paiton Energy under which   Paiton will supply energy for 10 months, at a rate said to be   much lower than the original agreed-upon price.   Other PPA   renegotiations will likely force IPPs to operate at a loss   until the Indonesian economy revives and PLN's financial   situation improves.   Unbundling is underway on Java/Bali,   where PLN has created two generation subsidiaries.   Outside   Java/Bali, unbundling of PLN will be along geographic lines.   The Indonesian government recently selected KEMA Consulting   to develop rules for a competitive market.   ?   Japan:   On March 21, 8000 large customers (30% of the market)   were allowed to choose a supplier.   This broke the monopolies   of the ten regional IOUs for the first time, but high   transmission access fees set by the incumbents are inhibiting   true competition. Newer liberalization measures in the   electricity and gas sectors have since been written ---   an   agreement was signed at the July G8 Summit which provides for   fair and transparent non-discriminatory access to   distribution networks in both sectors.   A number of new   companies are entering (or planning to enter) the market,   largely set up as JVs with local non-incumbents, often   offering new products and services.   In August the government awarded a tender to a non-utility,   Diamond Power, a Mitsubishi unit, to supply electricity to   the Ministry of Trade and Industry at a rate 4% lower than   incumbent TEPCO's.   TEPCO plans to build a new nuclear plant   to cut generation costs and plans to streamline operations in   the face of increased competition.   ?   Malaysia:   Jamaludin Jarjis was appointed as the new chairman   of Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) in July.   He assured   investors that restructuring begun three years ago by his   predecessor would remain intact.   TNB will be transformed   into two separate T&amp;D companies by 20003, with an equity   interest in generation.   Generation assets have already been   separated into TNB Generation; thermal generation will be   sold.   The government has approved the construction of more   IPPs to meet the demand for electricity, which has grown 12%   compared to the period before the economic crisis.   Work on   the Bakun Hydro Project in East Malaysia has resumed, but it   remains to be seen whether the project will go ahead as   originally planned or on a smaller scale.   ?   New Zealand: 1999 saw ECNZ split into three gencos to create   further competition   --- Genesis Power, Meridian Energy, and   Mighty River Power.   They have been corporatized but will   remain under government ownership.   Legislation passed in   1999 forbade ownership of wires (non-competitive) and   generation and retailing (competitive) by the same company.   Companies have until 20004 either to sell one business type or   to set up a separate trust to own and run the businesses they   do not wish to keep. By February '000, most had implemented   full separation.   The newly merged (75.8%) NGC/TransAlta will   be the largest energy retailer in New Zealand, with a market   cap of NZ$2.1billion and more than 650,000 customers.   ?   Pakistan:   Pakistan is trying to attract IPPs with negotiated   PPAs which allow fixed ROR of 12%, but IPPs face continued   lack of guarantees and other political uncertainties.   Problems continue over Hub Power Company (Hubco), the largest   IPP project in Pakistan.   Hubco is receiving significantly   lower payments from WAPDA than originally contracted.   The   government has alleged that corruption occurred when the PPA   was amended in the 19990's, making the wholesale power tariff   untenable for WAPDA and excessively lucrative for Hubco.   More than 20% of plants have already been sold in a phased   sell-off of WAPDA's generation.   Eight parties have been   short-listed for the pending privatization of 51% of Karachi   Electric Supply Commission, but the sale has been often   delayed.   ?   Philippines:   An Omnibus Electricity Bill, which will set   the framework for the breakup and privatization of Napocor,   is stalled in a House-Senate reconciliation committee.   The   Asian Development Bank has threatened to withhold all   financial assistance, including $1000million in loans for   power related projects, until the legislation is passed.   Napocor is on the verge of bankruptcy and energy department   officials are looking at several alternate options for   selling the utility in the absence of a restructuring bill.   Government-appointed advisers have also recommended that   Napocor renegotiate some of its take-or-pay contracts with   IPPs, asking some IPPs to reduce power off-take on an interim   basis.   Napocor has offered the IPPs that accede to these   conditions a longer life span for their projects, but   developers are reluctant to accept because of their own   financial commitments.   ?   Singapore:   Since initial restructuring and corporatization   in 19995 and the establishment of a pool in 19998, Singapore   has lagged in power sector deregulation.   Investors complain   that the market lacks clarity and that retail competition has   yet to develop even though the rules allow competition for   large consumers.   A thorough review in 1999 by the Ministry   of Trade and Industry recommended that:   generation   be   privatized, but with restrictions on generation   cross-ownership; transmission and market operation functions   be separated and an ISO established; and that most retail   services be privatized.   The government has granted two   public retail licenses, meaning that the two IPPs can sell   electricity directly to large users.   Retail licenses are   expected to be issued to the three power generators.   This   will allow full competition for large industrial and   commercial customers, but retail competition for smaller   customers is unlikely to be in place before 20002.   ?   South Korea: South Korea is proceeding with a major   restructuring program, following government approval in July   1999 for state-owned KEPCO to be broken up into six gencos.   KEPCO will retain the nuclear assets as one genco.   Each of   the five other gencos will be listed in stages on the Korea   Stock Exchange; up to 30% foreign ownership will be   permitted.   The privatized gencos will sell to KEPCO, which   will initially retain its T&amp;D services.   Later, a UK-type   pool will be established where all generators will sell into   the pool. Competition in distribution and retailing is a   long-term target.   IPP projects totaling 2,515MW are already   in operation.   Impending restructuring has not deterred   foreign interest in several ongoing IPPs.   ?   Taiwan: Two phases of IPP development have been approved, but   only one IPP scheme has started up.   Developers have faced   land acquisition problems, causing IPP schedules to slip.   In   1999, the government announced plans to launch Phase Three,   limited to gas-fired plants.   An Electricity Act is before   Parliament.   Its main provisions include: privatizing   Taipower without unbundling G-T-D; allowing other companies   to enter the market as either vertically integrated,   generation, transmission or distribution companies and to pay   Taipower a fee for using its facilities; and the creation of   an independent regulator, especially for tariffs.   IPPs will   be able to supply customers at 161kV and above, and IPP   prices will not be regulated.   ?   Thailand: The 1999 State Enterprise Corporatization Act laid   out a three-stage process for all state-owned enterprises,   including power, to create fully competitive, restructured   and privatized sectors.   A draft Energy Act is under   discussion, while preparation and implementation of various   technical frameworks are underway. Under the Act, a   competitive wholesale pool would be introduced in 20003,   although some sources doubt that it could be ready by then.   It is also unclear how soon Thailand will have a transparent   and independent regulatory body. EGAT transferred two thermal   units to Ratchaburi following its IPO in October; EGAT also   plans to corporatize and partially privatize its non-hydro   plants by 20003.   Before the economic crisis, the government   had an ambitious IPP program; EGAT now has excess capacity,   so has delayed many projects.   Its long-term plans include   the construction of a series of Small Producer Plants (SPPs)   using renewable energy.   PPAs have been signed with 50 SSPs.   ?   Vietnam: Vietnam is in the nascent stages of reforming its   power system. Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) is an unbundled   state monopoly, which does not even service rural customers.   Local villages provide services to small farmers and small   commercial businesses using thin wires and low standards. The   World Bank has approved a $150million credit to Vietnam to   extend grid electricity to about 450,000 households scattered   throughout the country.   A few IPPs are trying to win   generation projects.   An Electricity Law due to be enacted   in 20001 would establish a National Electricity Office for   regulation.   This would replace the existing haphazard   village-level regulatory system.   Profoundly affected by inflation and currency fluctuations, many   Latin American countries have postponed further privatizations.   At   the same time, ownership limits imposed by several governments limit   further investments by companies who have already entered the market.   According to the Inter-American Development Bank, privatization of   electricity distribution and generation has been accomplished in all   of the major Latin American economies with the exceptions of   Venezuela and Mexico.   It estimates that 75 million Latin Americans   are still not connected to the grid in rural areas of poorer   countries such as Peru, Bolivia, and some Central American countries.   Many of the countries that have not already implemented reforms are   beginning to propose regulatory structures that would open markets to   investments.   And for those who were already open, a new development   is the increasing number of transmission systems being offered either   as concessions to build or as full privatizations.   A big factor   impacting generation this year has been the region's heavy reliance   on hydro-power.   Serious region-wide droughts during the last few   years have caused power shortages and scared away some investors.   ?   Argentina:   The big news is in Argentina transmission sector.   This fall, Argentina auctioned off 25% of Transener in an   IPO, while also offering six lines to the private sector on a   B-O-M (build-operate-maintain) basis. Endesa (Spain) must   divest one of its two Buenos Aires distributors due to   antitrust concerns   (Endesa's two companies are now serving   40% of the countries 36 million people).   The regulator   believes that the two holding inhibit its ability to evaluate   efficiency and to set prices.   ?   Brazil:   Brazil's wholesale energy market (WEM) began   operating in October; initially, only 5-10% of power bought   or sold will go through WEM.   As other contracts expire it   will eventually supervise $15 billion worth of power.   The   WEM intends also to create an internet-based trading system.   The Brazilian system, 95% hydro-run, is dependent on   plentiful rains to avoid shortages.   Demand growth has far   outstripped GDP, while new generation is not keeping pace.   Analysts predict a 15% shortage in 20001, with intermittent   brownouts, while neighbors are building generation with an   eye to exporting power to Brazil.   Sao Paulo state will sell 38.6% of CESP Parana, one of the   last large generation privatizations,   in December.   The   state is incenting buyers by offering financing for any   premium paid over the minimum price of R1.74 billion (US$   901mil).   Brazil also conducted a successful action of three   transmission lines in August on a build-operate basis.   ?   Bolivia:   Ende, Bolivia's utility, was unbundled in '94 and   has been successively sold off through capitalization (a 50%   stake and management control).   To meet demand rising at 7.5%   annually, the government has ordered these buyers to invest   $296 million in the next three years or face losing their   concessions; they have not fulfilled previous obligations in   upgrades.   Generators recently defeated an attempt to allow   distributors to generate up to 30% of demand instead of 15%.   ?   Chile: Privatization in Chile is largely complete. Endesa's   (Spain) controversial takeover of Enersis (Chile) will be the   basis for its diversification into telecom, via its   subsidiaries Enersis and Chilectra.   Partially in response to   Endesa's vertical dominance, partially in response to supply   conditions engendered by prolonged drought, and partially to   increase competition, Chile has proposed new regulation plans   which will open the distribution market and reduce node   (unregulated) prices from 2MW to 0.2 MW.   Until now,   transmission charges have been based on existing operating   costs. Under the proposed reform, they would be calculated on   the operational costs of an optimum network. The reforms also   intended to remove control of the grid operation from the   generators.   The proposed changes likely account for Hydro   Quebec's being the sole bidder among those pre-qualified for   the 1000% sale of Transelec in September.   1999 marked a serious recession and drought, seriously   affecting hydro generators, which represent nearly 80% of   Chile's generation.   Under the existing system, generators   had no incentive to plan for long-term supply.   Chile hopes   the new regulations will break down the entry barriers to   generation and to introduce competition into distribution,   heretofore a monopoly.   ?   Colombia: Continuing labor strikes plus terrorist attacks   against transmission installations have forced the government   to postpone the sale of any further power assets, including   Isagen, the state generator, ISA, the transco, as well as 14   regional distributors. (A March attack, for instance, caused   a blackout in 9 provinces and most of Bogota for six hours or   more.)   The government claims to be reassessing the rules,   but the reality is that the assets would not receive any   decent offer now.   For now, 1000- 3000 million new shares   (13.5% of capital) in ISA will be sold to the public at a 15%   discount, to \"democratize\" the power sector. Since January   '000, 90% of the market has had choice.   ?   Cuba:   The first IPP began delivering power to Cuba's grid in   October '98.   In order to curb programmed blackouts, it has   invited foreign investors to help discover and develop new   crude reserves.   Cuba hopes that 70% of its power will be   generated from local fuels by year-end.   ?   Dominican Republic: Blackouts still plague this nation a year   after the government split state-owned CDE into separate   G-T-D units.   Investors paid $750 for a 50% stake and   management control of non-hydro generation and of   distribution.   The new government is requiring IPPs (who   provide 40% of the republic's power) to renegotiate the terms   of the privatization contracts signed with the prior   government.   In the hopes of increasing competition and   lowering prices, the gencos are planning a power   clearinghouse through which they will sell electricity to T&amp;D   companies.   It will, however, \"only function when there is   adequate electricity to meet demand.\"   ?   Ecuador: The government has hired Salomon to oversee the sale   of its power sector.   There is a current investment limit of   39%, which may need to be raised to 51%.   The government   realizes that reforms will need to come before privatization   in order to attract capital.   Its largest utility, EMELEC,   will be sold in international bidding to pay off extensive   debts.   ?   El Salvador: In October, AES bought Reliant's interest in   three discos (privatized in 19998), which together serve 60%   of the population.   CEL, the SOU, does not plan to privatize   its hydro assets or the transmission grid for the moment.   ?   Guatemala:   Guatemala sold two major discos in 19998;   investors have made significant system upgrades.   State   utility INDE still owns 45% of the country's generation, all   in hydro.   It extensively encouraged IPPs in the early 90s   with take-or-pay PPAs; IPPs are allowed unrestricted grid   access.   The power sector, while needing new investment for   the next five years, may soon be in trouble due to currency   devaluation, high fuel costs, and the effect of the PPAs.   Guatemala also needs to finish writing the implementing   regulations to their 19997 law to encourage more investment.   ?   Jamaica:   For the second time in four years, the Jamaican   government has proposed a partial privatization of PSC, which   handles all of T&amp;D and 75% of the island's generation.   And,   for the second time, it is Southern who is in the forefront   of privatization negotiations.   It is still not clear what   percent will be sold, but it seems likely to be a marginal   minority of 45%, without G-T-D first being spun-off.   ?   Mexico: The new Fox administration plans to revive   electricity reform, tabled last year, without which energy   cannot keep pace with economic growth.   Fox says there will   be no privatizations, but an opening of the market.   Private   participation in the distribution sector would require a   constitutional change.   Many believe that constitutional   change will be necessary to achieve adequate reforms.   Mexico estimates it needs investments of $25 billion in the   power sector in the next five years to meet growing demand;   reserve margins are at 6%, while consumption is growing at 6%   - 8% annually.   Without a clear regulatory bill opening the   market to competition, investment is inhibited.   IPPs have   heretofore been built on a B-O-O basis.   Recent tenders have   included the option to build either in the U.S. or Mexico,   with power dedicated to Mexico.   ?   Nicaragua:   The privatization of state-owned power company   (ENEL) is underway, following its restructuring.   Assets were   first split into G-T-D companies.   In September '000, Spain's   Union Fenosa acquired 95% of two discos for $1115 million in   an auction in which it was the sole bidder. High oil prices   forced the government to postpone the October sale of the   three gencos; two of the three pre-qualified companies failed   to submit final bids.   Also, the political opposition has   challenged the legality of the privatization in the Supreme   Court.   ?   Panama: Privatization of government-held IRHE is now   complete; 51% of distribution and generation was sold in   19998. The government plans to retain control of transmission.   Foreign investors are involved in building some generation.   The big news is the Central American integrated grid, which   should join Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,   Costa Rica, and Panama into a single market by 20006.   The   IADB is running project.   ?   Peru: The new Energy Minister, Chamot, favors re-starting the   privatization program, stalled since September '999.   SOUs   mentioned for privatization were six regional energy   companies, as well as a 850MW Andean hydro complex, Mantaro.   It was not clear what form privatization would take; nor is   it clear what will happen now that Fujimori has resigned and   fled.   Peru also announced bids for construction and   operation of two transmission lines.   Currently, only large   industrials, representing 10% of the market, have choice.   There are no plans to expand this.   ?   Trinidad and Tobago: While there has been a partial   unbundling of the generation arm of T&amp;TEC, the government   utility retains control of T&amp;D as well as of all of natural   gas purchases.   There been neither much IPP nor privatization   activity since the sale of 49% of T&amp;TEC to Southern and BP   Amoco in 19996 and the financing of one IPP in 19998.   ?   Venezuela: The Chavez government imposed an electricity   restructuring law in August 1999.   Industrials can choose   their supplier, but there are no plans to open the market   completely.   A wholesale market is proposed for 20002.   Venezuela has the lowest tariffs in the Western hemisphere,   due to high subsidization.   While the government dithered on   privatization plans, AES jumped in with a surprise bid for   the ADRs of Electricidad de Caracas.   The government recently   announced a tentative sale date of early 20001 for 51% of two   regional electric companies, Enelven and Semda.   Privatization has oft been postponed, most recently because   of unknown effects of Venezuela's new electricity law on its   rate policy.   ? Virgin Islands: In September '000, this U.S. territory's Senate   quashed a deal in which Southern had privately negotiated for   an 80% purchase of the Water and Power Authority.   The Islands   could use the money, but the Senate objected to the lack of   bidding or transparency.   It was in principle opposed neither   to privatization nor to Southern.   African and Middle Eastern governments are increasingly opening their   power sectors to foreign investment, although most have not moved   beyond allowing IPPs.   Many Gulf-States' IPPs are for water and   power.   Increasingly, power sector forecasts include reliance on the   private sector for generation capacity additions.   Five Sub-Saharan   countries have privatized their power systems: C\"te d'Ivoire, Gabon,   Guinea, Mali, and Senegal.   A few countries are beginning to discuss   partial privatization of the entire government-owned entity, rather   than spinning off G-T-D and undergoing separate privatization.   Heavy reliance on hydro power in some areas of Africa have put   pressure on prices, due to sustained droughts, especially in East   Africa.   Droughts are usually not conducive to advancing   restructuring agendas in different countries.   A notable regional trend in both Africa and the Middle East are the   schemes for regional transmission links.   The Mozambique   Transmission Company links South Africa, Mozambique, and Swaziland;   the West African Power Pool will link 16 countries; there is a   Six-Country link underway between Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria, and   Turkey, and later Lebanon.   ?   Algeria: Interior minister Khelil, who as a World Bank   official oversaw the restructuring of state oil companies in   several countries, is committed to \"a profound restructuring   of Sonatrach (the NOC) and the power sector (Sonelgaz).\"   Legislation was introduced this summer that would unbundle   G-T-D, end Sonelgaz' generation monopoly, and allow for IPPs   on a B-O-T basis. Some of the IPPs are intended for domestic   consumption, and some for export.   Algeria is keenly   interested in sending power to deregulating European markets   via a new undersea link to Spain.   ?   Ghana:   With a vast hydroelectric station on the Volta River,   98% of Ghana's current power needs are supplied by   hydroelectricity. Ghana's planned privatization of its   distribution company into 4-5 regional companies is possible   in 20001.   It is implementing a series of power sector reforms   designed to provide Ghanaians with universal access to   electricity and to transform Ghana into a middle-income   country within one generation.   It is moving to reduce its   reliance on hydro-power by allowing IPPs to build deisel,   gas, and light crude plants.   Regionally, Ghana is committed   to building a West African Power Pool (WAPP) by expanding   electricity generation and interconnections.   ?   Morocco:   Two distribution concessions are due to be awarded   for Tangiers and Tetouan.   The concession covers the   provision of water, sewerage, and electrical services to   these two northern areas. Two earlier power/water concessions   (Casablanca, Rabat) were awarded.   Morocco has an active IPP   program; one of the plants was even transferred to the   builders after its completion.   No sale of transmission   assets is planned.   ?   Nigeria: The IMF has provided Nigeria a $1billion facility to   encourage reform and to support civilian President Obasnjo.   In November, the government announced plans to privatize   ailing NEPA, the SOU. While a draft electricity policy has   been prepared, no details have emerged.   They intend to send   regulatory legislation to the parliament by the end of   December, which should include a framework for foreign IPP   investors.   It is also likely that NEPA will be broken up,   prior to privatization. Enron is supplying 270MW via 9   barge-mounted power facilties off Lagos to ease the power   shortages in this oil-rich country.   ?   Senegal: Showing how risky foreign investment remains, the   new Senegalese government has asked Hydro Qu,bec and Elyo to   leave, less than two years after they won a 34% interest in   state EU S,n,lec.   The current government, while   acknowledging the advances made in rehabilitating old plants,   cited cronyism on the part of its predecssors.   ?   South Africa: Eskom, South Africa's parastatal, generates 95%   of the country's power, and transmits it over national lines   to municipal distributors.   South Africa is moving slowly   towards restructuring and unbundling of G-T-D.   The   fragmented distribution system will be merged into six   discos, while plants may be grouped into gencos. Last year,   G-T-D activities were \"ring-fenced\" to evaluate costs for   each business.   A new structure for the electricity supply   industry is being discussed, and the possibility of   privatizing 30% of Eskom's power stations has been raised for   the first time. Electricity regulators announced in November   that they were considering three bids for the first IPP   license, to be offered next year. While South Africa needs   new generation capacity by 20004, it now exports power to its   neighbors, and is very active in the creation of a regional   transmission network.   Eskom has ambitions to be a global   player, while continuing to focus on its development agenda   of rural electrification.   Eskom Enterprises, the unregulated   business subsidiary, is considering an IPO.   ?   Egypt: In July, the Egyptian Electricity Authority was   converted into a holding company, although still state-owned.   It intends to offer 49% stakes in seven or eight regional G&amp;D   companies.   The sale of Greater Cairo Electricity, valued at   $2.1 billion, will be first, although it has been twice   postponed.   All capacity additions will be solicited   competitively as IPPs under the BOOT (build- own- operate-   transfer) model. This allows developers to recover   construction costs by running a plant, while the state   eventually owns the project without affecting its debt   profile.   Egypt is part of a planned Six-Country   transmission link.   ?   Israel: Israel has been discussing restructuring and   privatization for a few years now, but no real progress has   been made. An electricity law passed in March '96 extended   the Israel Electric Company (IEC) license for 10 years in   exchange for its accepting 10% of it power needs (9000MW) from   IPPs, and another 10% from foreign developers. So far, only   one IPP has been built.   Recent offshore gas discoveries have   been largely in Palestinian waters; further exploration will   be n\n"

Most of these moves are attributable new business startups (eg EGM, ENW and EIM) and normal course of business transfers within the company.   The formal redeployment process makes up only a small fraction of the total moves in the company.   ---"

If you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.As far as recommendations, here is a short list: 1.   Examine LDC's incentive rate program.   Current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future   replacement cost.   The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.   This creates a shortage in later months. 2.   California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand.   Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.   Specific questions should include:   1.   Why in March '000-May '000   weren't total system receipts higher in order to fill storage?   2.   Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too much gas from Socal's system.   I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand.   They repeatedly estimated they would receive   more gas than their injection capablity, but injected far less. 3.   Similar to the power market,   there is too much benchmarking to short term prices.   Not enough forward hedging is done by the major   LDCs.   By design the customers are short at a floating rate.

We have written this up before, I think we just need to put it in letter form.   Alan --- please take the lead on this and get a draft to Linda.   I think we should identify the information and also prepare a letter for the Chairman (?) that could be sent to the FERC.Murkowski (the Committee Chairman) asked for an itemized list of things the fed should do to expedite siting as well as anything else we feel is necessary   to address the California crisis.   We have identified the need for open access across the nation, but he is looking for what can be done in the 2-4 month time frame.   Dave, I think your memo to me is a good start.   Sue --- could you please put those and any other suggestions in letter form and get them to Linda?Finally, Sen Feinstein asked all of the witnesses to ask their CEOs not to \"price gouge\" --- yes, that's what she said.   She appealed to everyone's community spirit and asked suppliers to forbear charging high prices while California struggles to fix its problems.   I think we should send a response from Ken.   Jeff --- please take a cut and get to Linda.   I think the basic messages should be:   we are actively working on solutions with California policymakers (forward contracting was our idea after all); we are actively pursuing demand reduction in the state, etc.   We should also explain the nature of our business and pick up on some of the other solutions we identified in the written testimony, offer to meet to discuss further, etc.\n"

Very funny!...from one of my limey friends...:)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE&lt; To the citizens of the United States of America,&lt; In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to&lt; govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your&lt; independence, effective today.&lt; Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchical duties&lt; over all states, commonwealths and other territories.   Except Utah, which&lt; she does not fancy.   Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP&lt; for the 97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a&lt; world outside your borders) will appoint a minister for America without&lt; the need for further elections.   Congress and the Senate will be&lt; disbanded.   A questionnaire will be circulated next year to determine&lt; whether any of you noticed.&lt; To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following&lt; rules are introduced with immediate effect:&lt; 1. You should look up \"revocation\" in the Oxford English Dictionary.&lt; Then look up \"aluminium\".   Check the pronunciation guide.   You will be&lt; amazed at just how wrong you have been pronouncing it.   Generally, you&lt; should raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels.   Look up \"vocabulary\".&lt; Using the same twenty seven words   interspersed with filler noises such as&lt; \"like\" and \"you know\" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of&lt; communication.   Look up \"interspersed\".&lt; 2. There is no such thing as \"US English\".   We will let Microsoft know&lt; on your behalf.&lt; 3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.&lt; It&lt; really isn't that hard.&lt;&lt; 4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as&lt; the good guys.&lt; 5. You should relearn your original national anthem, \"God Save The&lt; Queen\", but only after fully carrying out task 1.   We would not want you&lt; to get confused and give up half way through.&lt; 6. You should stop playing American \"football\".   There is only one kind&lt; of football.   What you refer to as American \"football\" is not a very good&lt; game.&lt; The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders&lt; may have noticed that no one else plays   \"American\" football.   You will no&lt; longer be allowed to play it, and should instead play proper football.&lt; Initially, it would be best if you played with the girls.   It is a&lt; difficult game.   Those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to&lt; play rugby (which is similar to American \"football\", but does not involve&lt; stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body&lt; armour like nancies).   We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby&lt; sevens side by 20005.&lt; 7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons&lt; if they give you any merde.   The 98.85% of you who were not aware that&lt; there is a world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.   The&lt; Russians have never been the bad guys.   \"Merde\" is French for \"sh*t\".&lt; 8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.   November 8th will be a new&lt; national holiday, but only in England.   It will be called \"Indecisive&lt; Day\".&lt; 9. All American cars are hereby banned.   They are crap and it is for&lt; your own good.   When we show you German cars, you will understand what we&lt; mean.&lt; 10. Please tell us who killed JFK.   It's been driving us crazy.&lt;&lt; Thank you for your cooperation.&lt;This e-mail, its content and any files transmitted with it are intended solely for the addressee(s) and are confidential and may be legally privileged.

Assuming pipeline and LDC mark-ups remain constant, the delivered prices were adjusted for the NYMEX Henry Hub projection of wellhead prices for the 2000-20001 winter period.   A national projection is also included.Because the commodity portion of the gas bill for residential customers is a smaller percent of the total bill compared to commercial and industrial customers, the increase for residential customers will be less pronounced than for commercial or industrial customers.   In addition, LDC purchased gas cost mechanisms will moderate the effect of the price increase to some extent because monthly price increases are averaged out over an extended period (12 months in some cases).   Furthermore, some state public utility commissions (e.g. Connecticut) are conducting meetings with LDCs to discuss looking for ways to lessen the impact of the projected increases. That being said, Nipsco recently announced residential prices are expected to increase 50-60% this winter over last winter (in line with the projection for Illinois).If you are interested in a similar projection for other states, or have comments with respect to the above let me know.\n"

At this time, we have about40 executives from venture capital, communications and other high techbusinesses attending the conference.   Most of those attendees joined theDSCC's High Technology Council in 2000.The Council was created last year in order to create a bridge betweenDemocratic Senators and key leaders of the New Economy.   Throughout 2000, wehosted dinners, meetings and conferences that gave high tech leaders andSenators the opportunity to engage in an ongoing dialogue on the key issuesfacing the nation.   As a result, the Senators and participants in theCouncil were able to develop a solid understanding of the challenges facingboth government and business.   We hope that this effort has created afoundation for strong, long-term relationships between the two groups.The Conference in March is a continuation of last year's efforts, but wewill focus on a few of the key issues facing the New Economy to allow bothsides can drill down and gain a better understanding of some of theopportunities and problems we will face in the near future.In order to attend, you would need to become a member of the DSCC's HighTech Council by donating $25,000 to the DSCC.   That would make you eligibleto participate in a series of events, conferences and meetings this yearwith other industry leaders and Democratic Senators.I have attached an invitation to the event, a registration form andinformation on becoming a member of the Council.   We have reserved only asmall number of rooms for new members of the DSCC's High Tech Council.   Ifyou would like to attend, please let me know as soon as possible and pleasedo not hesitate to contact me regarding any questions, concerns or for moreinformation.   I can have a firm agenda to you in the very near future but Iam waiting on some feedback from people like yourself regarding the issuesthey would like to discuss.   In your response, please let me know if youhave any particular issues that are of concern to you.Thank you very much for your time and consideration.Sincerely,Chad FitzGeraldDirector - DSCC High Technology Council(202) 485-3156 &lt;&lt;Invite.doc&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;Registration Form New Members.doc&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;DSCC HTCouncil.doc&lt;&lt; - Invite.doc - Registration Form New Members.doc - DSCC HT Council.doc\n"

This guy (Jim Cofield) called me on my cell phone last night about 7:000 p.m. to get my e-mail address.   He asked that I take a look at his e-mail in the morning and route it to the appropriate person within Enron.   The \".jpg\" files below have no information in them, but the \".doc\" file is a 14 page document with numerous correspondence from Mary Beth Cahill, former director in the White House Office for Public Liaison, to Mr. Cofield regarding a trip to Nigeria that he supposedly accompanied President Clinton on several months ago; followed by a number of \"proprietary information documents\" that mean absolutely nothing to me; followed by an overview of Nigeria's electrical power situation; etc...The best I can tell, they are trying to get Enron to bid on some project in Nigeria.Since this e-mail is copied to the Vice President of the United States in addition to several ambassadors, I thought it might need attention.   If you can figure it out, please let me know how to proceed.   Thanks, SRS---",

Weisbrod, Glen E. WeisbrodSunday,?February 25, 20001 ,20001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http:///www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/20001/02/25/SC1777059.DTL WE COULD HAVE left it to the states. When the Interstate Highway System was proposed nearly 50 years ago, we could have said, \"Leave it to each state to decide on its roads and to pay for them, or leave it to private enterprise to build toll roads wherever it is profitable.\" Fortunately, we didn't. Today, vehicles can travel throughout the country on a system of integrated high-capacity roads that crisscross the nation. There are many differences between the flow of cars or trucks and the flow of electricity. But just as the Interstate Highway System ushered in a new era of easier movement of people and goods across the states, allowing enormous economic and social gains, so, too, do we now need to overcome the obstacles to the easy flow of power across state lines. Many forces are at work contributing to California's electricity crises, and power shortages in other parts of the country also are quite possible. The growth of population and industry in California has expanded demand for electricity. Legislative constraints, reflecting environmental protection and other concerns, have discouraged construction of electricity-generating plants. Periodic shutdowns of generation plants for maintenance have caused short- term power shortages. And, in an oddity of California law, the prices that power producers can charge distributors are deregulated, while the prices that those distributors can charge consumers are regulated and restricted. But largely missing from the debate of what can be done to balance supply and demand is discussion of an effective national power grid that would permit substantial amounts of electricity to flow, as highway traffic does, from one state to another. Interstate transmission connections do exist now, but are limited in capacity. They were primarily designed to meet temporary needs associated with local power emergencies, not for sustained use. If those interstate lines were upgraded to greater capacity, then we could move toward actually creating a national power grid. An effective national power grid could result in far more competition among producers of electric power across the nation, and far more options to meet demand in any local area. No state or region would need to depend simply on a small number of generating producers within its borders, and the increased number of interstate competitors would bring greater assurance of supply and lower prices. The underlying problem is basically one of incentives. With the maze of state, and federal regulations on the production, distribution and pricing of electricity, there is great risk and little incentive for private construction of costly transmission lines that cross multiple state borders. Imagine a power plant in state A, but near state B, with that plant occasionally having excess production capacity. There is no market for the power in state B, but there is demand for it in state C, which is adjacent to it. In a smoothly functioning, efficient, power transmission system, power would move from the generating plant in state A, across the border for use in state B, thereby permitting deals so that power produced in that area could be sent to state C. Through such a domino-like process, power available in one region effectively can help alleviate a shortage in another area - with only a series of relatively short-distance transmissions. Development of such an integrated electricity transmission network is what the federal government can and should foster. It would strengthen the nation; it would expand options for users; it would increase competition among suppliers, to the benefit of consumers; it would overcome the multiplicity of state regulations that have the effect of restricting incentives for profitable interstate power transmission. The Interstate Highway System did not solve all the problems of the nation's escalating population of cars, and it was not cheap. But, designed to maximize interconnections between metropolitan areas, with ample systemwide capacity to spare, it did transform the country, binding the 48 contiguous states into an integrated whole. The effect: reduced costs and increased \"exports\" of California fruits and vegetables to the Midwest, and reduced costs, along with increased exports of Midwest manufactured products to the West. Just as it does not make sense for every state to act like a separate country, building roads just for its own residents, or growing all of its own food supply, it is equally inefficient for each state to independently develop its own power supply. It is foolish to find electricity producers in one state claiming that they should not \"help out\" consumers in another state. A nationwide system would take better advantage of differential electricity demand in various parts of the country, seasonally and even in the course of a day. To consumers and industrial users in California, the effects of a national electricity transmission grid would be real and enduring, but not spectacular. It would, however, go far to achieving the quiet result that every consumer seeks - lower prices, more reliable electric power supplies. There is no single solution to California's energy crisis, but developing a national interstate electricity highway system would go far toward addressing it. Local power distribution within a state would remain a matter of state control. The federal government's role would be largely to provide financial incentives for constructing additional interstate transmission capacity, and to establish standards for its design and utilization - just as is the case with the Interstate Highway System. A survey of history and government professors conducted by the Brookings Institution last year identified the Interstate Highway System as one of the Top Seven governmental achievements of the last 50 years - along with rebuilding Europe after World War II and expanding the right to vote. An interstate electricity highway system could well be among the top achievements of government in the next half-century. MACRO POWER TRANSMISSIONWE HAVE AN ELECTRIC power crisis in California. In fact, we have two problems: a short-term problem and a long-term problem. Short term, the problem, from the consumer perspective, is: --- Soaring electricity bills. --- Fear of paying the mounting debts being incurred by electricity distributors such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. either in rate increases or higher taxes. --- The threat, and to some users the reality, of no lights, no refrigeration, no heat. These concerns are real and severe. But they are merely symptoms of a serious long-term crisis: Incentives to the power industry are wrong! As Adam Smith reminded us over two centuries ago, we do not look to the good intentions of sellers to get them to serve the public interest; we look to their self interest. Then, as today, wise public policy calls for aligning the two, by providing incentives for the development of an electricity system that provides power that is dependable, is produced efficiently and is distributed competitively, so that prices are low. This long-term problem will not be solved by the series of Band-Aids that governmental officials and power producers and distributors are skirmishing over. Now is the time to develop a long-term plan. Two elements of a long-term plan for efficient and reliable electricity are clear: --- Electricity self-sufficiency for each state is bad policy. It is easy to think that dependency on power imports from other states is a root problem. It is not. Trade and competition mean access to more producers, and that can bring efficiency in electricity no less than in food, electronics or autos, as low-cost sources are utilized. (Promoting more interstate options does not preclude building more local generation, and small, \"micro\" electricity generating units do have a role as part of an overall electricity policy. However, the advantage of their flexibility must be balanced against their generally higher cost for meeting predictable long-term demand.) --- Incentives are needed to encourage investment in electricity transmission. It does no good to have low-cost power production unless the power can reach users. This is why the federal government has such an important role to play in financially encouraging and supporting a national interstate power highway system. ---Burton A. Weisbrod and Glen E.

Page?WB1 Governor Calls for 10% Cut In UsageOn national TV, Davis increases goal on energy Tanya Schevitz, Chronicle Staff WriterMonday,?February 26, 20001 ,20001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: http:///www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/20001/02/26/MN444189.DTL Signaling a greater urgency in California's power crisis, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that keeping the lights and air conditioners running this summer will require every Californian to reduce electricity usage by about 10 percent. In addition, he said, the state must get more electrical power online by then. His call for a 10 percent cut is a significant jump from the 7 percent he was asking for during his State of the State speech last month, and it may be a difficult stretch for consumers. Davis made his remarks on NBC's news show \"Meet the Press.\" State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, praised the governor's statement on national television. \"The most important thing right now is that the governor said that, because there has been general skepticism statewide, reflected both in anecdotes and public opinion polls, that we are in fact facing a crisis,\" Perata said. \"If you don't believe, you won't conform, you won't respond.\" But, he said, Davis will not get the conservation he wants unless consumers are given financial incentives. Perata said he will propose legislation today to give $1 billion to customers who cut down on their electricity use during the summer months. Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, said if temperatures soar this summer, it will take a \"huge effort\" to keep the state at safe electricity levels. NEED FOR CONSERVATION\"We are in big trouble,\" Borenstein said. \"That doesn't mean we can't avoid blackouts --- that means we will have to take serious measures.\" The needed steps include instituting variable prices for commercial and industrial users that reflect the supply and demand at any given hour and hooking up air conditioners to cycling systems, he said. For residential users, he said, it will mean increases for use above a certain level. Forecasters predict a shortfall of at least 5,000 megawatts this summer, but the state got some good news Thursday when the California Independent System Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power grid, removed all power alerts for the first time in more than a month. Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California ISO, said that she does not expect any changes today but that it is too early to make any predictions about the summer power situation. \"We still need to check the snowpack and the hills and the hydro situation in the state,\" O'Donley said. \"Conservation is a big part of it, and whatever people can do to step up their conservation efforts will be a huge factor in avoiding blackouts.\" GOVERNOR DODGES BLAMEDavis appeared on \"Meet the Press\" while visiting Washington, D.C., for a meeting of the National Governors Association and a concurrent meeting of the Democratic Governors Association, which he chairs. With him on the program were Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas. Davis took the opportunity of the high-profile television show to tell East Coast decisionmakers and Wall Street analysts that the blame for the state's energy crisis does not lie with him and to reassure them that he is taking solid steps to resolve the problem. \"Both President Bush and I inherited California, a flawed deregulation system,\" he said during the broadcast. \"Secondly, no major plant has been built in California prior to my governorship for 12 years.\" He outlined some solutions, including the approval of nine new power plants, with six under construction and three expected to be online this summer, and 14 more in the pipeline. In a slip of the tongue, Davis said on yesterday morning's broadcast that consumers would need to cut electricity use to only 10 percent of last year. \"It will require every Californian using about 10 percent of the electricity than they did the year before and a little luck in getting some extra megawatts on line this summer,\" Davis said. What he meant, a spokesman said, was they had to cut use by 10 percent. Still, that will require significant sacrifice. In addition, Davis has said that he wants to add 5,000 megawatts of power --- enough for 5 million homes --- by summer. He has promised to speed up the approval process and provide bonuses to builders who finish before July. The state also established an $8000 million conservation program this year. But Borenstein said that many of the ideas floating around for spending the conservation money are for efforts that would not help for about another three years. ON NATIONAL MATTERSDuring yesterday's show, Davis also weighed in on President Bush's tax-cut proposal and former President Bill Clinton's controversial last-minute pardons. The administration should wait for a tax cut until the money is available, he said. \"All of us who have been in government for a while have seen the roller- coaster ride of surpluses and then shortages and surpluses and shortages,\" he said. \"Clearly, people need tax relief, but it should be moderated to the point where we don't kill the golden goose, which is a strong, growing economy. \" Although he received a significant campaign donation from the father of Carlos Vignali, the Los Angeles drug kingpin, Davis told show host Tim Russert that he never spoke with the family about the presidential pardon Vignali received on Clinton's last day in office. Davis said he did not have enough information to know whether the pardon was a mistake, but, he said, \"there's something about them in general that doesn't ring right.\" \"However,\" he said, \"people expect us to focus on things that matter to them, and they really want to see progress on education, the environment, tax relief, health care.\" Asked by Russert whether he is going to run for president in 20004, Davis did not rule it out but said that only re-election to the governorship in 20002 is on his horizon. \"I'm focused on keeping the lights on and making our schools better,\" he said.

Hogan\rApril 24, 20001\r EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r Beginning in June of 2000, the shock of unexpectedly high prices in the=20\rCalifornia electricity market convinced everyone of the need for policies t=\ro=20\rcorrect the apparent market failures.? The public debate and policy=20\rdiscussions have been dominated by a focus on market power as a principal=\r=20\rproblem amenable to regulatory solution.? However, design of effective=20\rpolicies to moderate prices or mitigate their effects depends on the=20\rdiagnosis of the underlying causes.? High prices attributable largely to an=\r=20\rexercise of market power in electric generation would point to particular=\r=20\rmarket participants and behaviors that could be targeted for regulatory=20\raction.? By contrast, high prices attributable to bad electricity market=20\rdesign would indicate a need for changes in the design.? High prices=20\rattributable to higher fuel prices, environmental constraints and capacity=\r=20\rshortages, on the other hand, would prompt actions to address the cost of=\r=20\rfuel and environmental limitations and indicate that retail loads should=20\rreceive the appropriate price signal for conservation.\r Suppliers could affect market prices by strategically withholding some=20\rcapacity in order to profit on the capacity actually sold in the market.? B=\rut=20\rcharging high prices during periods of scarcity is not classified as=20\rexercising market power if there is no strategic withholding of supply.?=20\rLikewise, refusing to supply without being paid is not an exercise of marke=\rt=20\rpower.? Although the potential for withholding exists for many suppliers, t=\rhe=20\rfocus of attention has been on the exercise of market power by thermal=20\rgenerators in California.\r On its face, the experience of extremely high prices suggests that the=20\rexercise of market power could be important.? But at the same time the data=\r=20\rshow that there have been profound changes in the California market such th=\rat=20\rthe thermal generators have actually increased their production more than=\r=20\rdemand has grown.? If anything, thermal generators that hit annual output=\r=20\rlimits produced too much rather than too little in the summer of 2000.?=20\rFurthermore, the widespread impacts of higher electricity prices throughout=\r=20\rthe western market, both on and off peak,? indicate that if the exercise of=\r=20\rmarket power is important it is occurring to an extent and through channels=\r=20\runprecedented in this or other electricity markets.? In short, this is a=20\rcomplicated story, and there is ample room for further investigation of the=\r=20\rdata and diagnosis of causes.\r Examination of the major analyses of the exercise of market power reveals=\r=20\rthat the estimated magnitude of the possible strategic withholding of=20\relectric generation is small enough to make it important to verify the=20\rsimplifying assumptions.? If strategic withholding were large and pervasive=\r,=20\rthen the real details of the California electricity market could be ignored=\r.?=20\rBut it is by now apparent that the evidence is not clear, and any finding o=\rf=20\rthe presence or absence of strategic withholding of generation in the=20\rCalifornia electricity market could turn on the simplifying assumptions use=\rd=20\rin the analysis of the data.? For example, annual limits on production=20\rdictate that plants should not run in many hours when prices are higher tha=\rn=20\rdirect incremental costs; hence, examinations of output decisions for=20\rindividual hours or months are necessarily incomplete.? The variation in re=\ral=20\rtime conditions is large enough to produce significant reductions in output=\r=20\rcompared to the expectations given day-ahead prices; hence, with capacity=\r=20\rconstraints average optimal production is necessarily less than optimal=20\rproduction at average prices.? Limits on the ramping rate of generation=20\runits, start-up costs, minimum load costs and other operational=20\rinflexibilities imply that a dispatch day is not just twenty-four separate=\r=20\rhours and must be analyzed chronologically, recognizing these factors.? And=\r=20\rso on.? Accounting for such effects can reverse the implications of the=20\rprevious evidence.? Unfortunately, the real details are neither simple nor=\r=20\rincidental.\r It is difficult to conduct a study of market power based solely on publicly=\r=20\ravailable data.? A fuller analysis would require data available only to the=\r=20\rCalifornia Independent System Operator, and has not been done.? Many factor=\rs=20\rcontributed to higher electricity prices in California, and the market powe=\rr=20\rtheme is only, at most, part of the story.? The import of the previous=20\ranalyses is not to prove that market power has been exercised in the=20\rCalifornia electricity market but, rather, to suggest that it might be=20\rimportant.? The import of the sensitivity analysis here is not to prove tha=\rt=20\rmarket power has not been exercised in the electricity market? but, rather,=\r=20\rto suggest that it is unlikely to be the dominant factor and may not even b=\re=20\rsignificant.? With the available data in the public domain, and the special=\r=20\rcomplications introduced by the California market design, the margin of err=\ror=20\rin estimating the extent of the possible exercise of market power through=\r=20\rstrategic withholding of electric generation is of the same order of=20\rmagnitude as the effect being measured.? On balance, to date the publicly=\r=20\ravailable data provides no reason for the Federal Energy Regulatory=20\rCommission to change its conclusion that there is no evidence of strategic=\r=20\rwithholding nor any proof that no strategic withholding has occurred.\r By contrast, there is general agreement that the California electricity=20\rmarket design is =01&amp;seriously flawed.=018? Furthermore, there is evidence =\rthat the=20\rpolicy responses that have been adopted in California have accelerated an=\r=20\ralready serious market collapse.? Hence, without dismissing the possibility=\r=20\rof the exercise of market power, the principal policy focus should be on=20\rfashioning workable solutions for the other more serious problems in market=\r=20\rdesign that relate to the underlying causes of the market meltdown.\r Separate from market power mitigation, California should pay its bills, rai=\rse=20\rincremental prices to retail customers, and move as quickly as possible to=\r=20\roperating a coordinated and efficient market with consistent pricing for al=\rl=20\rthat includes unit commitment, day-ahead scheduling, and real-time=20\rbalancing.? Although not a panacea, these steps would address immediate=20\rproblems and set the stage for longer-term initiatives to expand generation=\r=20\rcapacity, transmission infrastructure, and the reach of an efficient market=\r=20\rto the western interconnected grid.\r   William W.

In a separate announcement, myHomeKey.com=\r=20\rannounced that it will offer energy savings packages designed to reduce=20\renergy consumption and lower rates for customers in the face of rising=20\renergy costs.\r ANALYSIS: As reports continue to accumulate that a natural-gas shortage=20\rwill send prices skyrocketing this winter (see my IssueAlert from Oct.=20\r9 on the subject), the most common response from electric utilities has=20\rbeen to warn their customers that they will see higher rates over the next=\r=20\rfew months. I can point to several examples. Minneapolis-based Xcel Energy=\r=20\rannounced a few weeks back that its natural-gas customers could face heatin=\rg=20\rbills that are 35 to 50 percent higher than their bills last winter. Domini=\ron=20\rEast Ohio has warned its residential customers that they can expect to=20\rpay about $70 more per month for natural gas from November through January.=\r=20\rAnd the warnings are coming not only in the Midwest and Northeast=01*where=\r=20\rlow winter temperatures drive up energy bills every year=01*but in the West=\r=20\ras well. In California, PG&amp;E warns that its customers can expect to see=20\rtheir winter bills increase by about $25, to an average bill of $75 (compar=\red=20\rto $50 last winter). These are just a few examples of utility companies=20\racross the United States playing damage control, trying to minimize the=20\rcustomer outrage when customers suddenly see their bills double or triple.\r Along with their warnings, these utilities give reasons=01*perhaps seen as=\r=20\rexcuses by the public=01*for the rising cost of energy. There is a shortage=\r=20\rof natural gas across the country, brought about by a drop-off in productio=\rn.=20\rIt was an unusually hot summer, which depleted supplies for energy. Demand=\r=20\rin general has grown to surprising levels.\r Meanwhile, start-up online companies that many of us have not even heard=20\rof are using the rise in natural-gas prices as a golden marketing=20\ropportunity,=20\rand attempting to take business away from traditional utility companies.=20\rSmartEnergy is a perfect example. In existence just since April 1999, =20\rSmartEnergy offers electricity and natural gas to residential and small=20\rbusiness customers. According to EnergyGuide.com, for an average home in=20\rNew York City, SmartEnergy's natural-gas rates typically have run about=20\r$189 per month, compared Con Edison's $140. Under its new promotion,=20\rSmartEnergy's=20\rplan for natural gas guarantees that New York City and Westchester gas=20\rcustomers who sign on with their service now will be locked into current=20\rnatural-gas rates for the next 12 months. This promotion comes at an ideal=\r=20\rtime for those who opt to switch, as natural-gas prices should begin their=\r=20\rprojected sharp increase over the next few weeks. Based on recent forecasts=\r,=20\rSmartEnergy is claiming that Con Edison customers who make the switch can=\r=20\rexpect to save up to 40 percent on their energy through the winter months.=\r=20\rThe start-up company also is offering 5000 United Airlines Mileage Plus=20\rReward Miles credit and $25 sign-up bonus to entice customers away from=20\rCon Edison.=20\r Based on the available information about SmartEnergy, it is unclear how=20\rthe online provider will be able to guarantee the 40-percent reduction=20\rin natural-gas rates. I would presume that SmartEnergy has entered into=20\rsome hedging strategies to minimize its risk in the event that natural-gas=\r=20\rprices remain high into the next year. Any prudent provider would have=20\ra hedging strategy to protect itself, and locking itself into 12-month=20\rcontracts without its own contracts for obtaining natural gas at spot marke=\rt=20\rprices would certainly raise questions about the future of SmartEnergy.=20\rIn addition, SmartEnergy will have difficulty in recruiting customers away=\r=20\rfrom Con Edison and other utility providers. Many customers still have=20\rreservations about signing on with an online company that they do not know.=\r=20\rThere will be some customers who jump at the chance to lock in current=20\rrates for 12 months, but many others will stick with the company that they=\r=20\rknow even if their rates increase.\r I did a quick search around Con Edison's Website to see if it might be=20\roffering an alternative offer to retain its customers, but could find nothi=\rng=20\rthat the utility is doing to specifically address the projected increase=20\rin natural-gas prices this winter. Con Edison does offer a level billing=20\rprogram in which customers receive a consistent bill amount each month,=20\ralleviating fluctuation in their bills. Yet, as a utility company, Con=20\rEdison has a standard offer of service that regulators closely monitor.=20\rIt is possible that Con Edison could request changes to the standard offer=\r=20\rservice, which would likely need to be approved by the New York Public=20\rService Commission. The PSC could agree, or determine that the competitive=\r=20\roffers by providers such as Smart Energy are a positive result of=20\rderegulation.=20\rIn addition, Con Edison could be hampered by fuel contracts that may not=20\rallow it much flexibility with regard to lowering its rates. Overall, Con=\r=20\rEdison probably does not have a lot of flexibility regarding the rates=20\rit can charge customers, thereby making this offer from SmartEnergy difficu=\rlt=20\rto beat.\r The other online start-up taking advantage of natural-gas prices is=20\rmyHomeKey.com,=20\rwhich made a recent promise to reduce home heating, oil, natural-gas, and=\r=20\relectricity rates. The marketing route that this online start-up is taking=\r=20\ris energy efficiency=01*teaching households how to more effectively use the=\rir=20\renergy and, hopefully, save money as a result. Energy is not the only servi=\rce=20\rof the myHomeKey.com; it is also involved in home maintenance and repair,=\r=20\rappliances, home monitoring and moving services. Yet, I learned that=20\rmyHomeKey.com=20\rjust recently launched co-branded sites with KeySpan Corp. and TXU Energy=\r=20\rServices to \"provide millions of local customers\" with the ability to check=\r=20\renergy efficiency in their homes.\r What's important to note about these two developments is the advantage=20\rthat online energy providers have over traditional utilities. As utilities=\r=20\rtry to disengage themselves from regulatory-bound rate structures, online=\r=20\rcompanies have the freedom and flexibility to offer attractive products=20\rand billing options to customers in deregulated states. There are the onlin=\re=20\rproviders that we know about, such as Utility.com and Essential.com.=20\rUtility.com=20\rhas not yet started to sell natural gas, although it has established a=20\rpartnership with Sempra Energy in which Sempra Energy Trading will sell=20\rnatural gas in deregulated markets via the Utility.com Web site. Utility.co=\rm=20\rplans to start selling natural gas by the end of this year, but it has=20\rnot developed any marketing campaign in this regard. Essential.com continue=\rs=20\rto open up its service across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions. Yet,=\r=20\ron a weekly basis, new start-up online energy providers surface, eager=20\rto grab their own share of the retail market.=20\r I also wonder where The New Power Company is in all of this rush to=20\rcapitalize=20\ron the marketing opportunities surrounding the rise in natural-gas prices.=\r=20\rIt would seem like a natural for TNPC to make a big splash with its own=20\rmarketing efforts, as it already promises lower prices for both natural=20\rgas and electricity. In any event, as the natural-gas shortage may become=\r=20\ra public relations nightmare for utility companies across the country,=20\rit conversely could work to the advantage of the more agile online provider=\rs\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\rRead about SCIENTECH's new PowerHitter interview with Jeff Sterba, Chairman=\r=20\r and CEO of the Public Service Company of New Mexico at:=20\rhttp:///www.consultrci.com=20 =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\r SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments please respond to him by May 25, 20001.Dave DelaineyFollowing my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting   to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just   2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. The actions points from this excercise are:1 to review and agree the attached mapping 2   consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them   as indicated on the attachment.3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.   Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.   To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.   Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of   reference. \n"

The following developments indicate that the legislation is still very much in play, but our primary concerns are making sure efforts going forward remain under control and preventing the passage of legislation that goes too far.Developments:House Republican leadership is not interested in pursuing the legislation any further, either through regular procedures or as an attachment to appropriations, \"omnibus\" or other must-pass measures.   They are somewhat angry at the industry for not being able to fight off advances made by Reps. Dingell and Oberstar, who were able to persuade enough Democrats to vote against the Senate bill so that it fell short of the 2/3 needed for passage under suspension of the rules.Senate bill sponsors/supporters are extremely angry at House Democrats for killing the Senate legislation, and at the White House/DOT for not strongly promoting the Senate bill (which they previously had supported) and reigning in House Democrats.   Senator Patty Murray called the White House and expressed her concern, which prompted a series of meetings between staff for Senate and House Democrats and the White House to discuss a solution.   In these meetings, House Democrats have proposed adding several provisions from the Dingell/Oberstar legislation to the Senate bill and moving that package on an omnibus or appropriations bill.   Sources close to Rep. Dingell indicate that they really do not want any bill at all, and are merely keeping up the pressure in an effort to see if they can get the Senate or industry to accept tougher provisions.Senate Democrats (including Murray, Bingaman, and Breaux) are not accepting any possible amendments to the original Senate bill, and are opposed to changing the Senate bill at all.   However, Senator Murray and Republican Senator Slade Gorton (who has a tough election) both want to continue to pursue the Senate bill (unamended) as a rider to an omnibus/appropriations bill.   The White House is looking to cover itself from a poor performance in the House, and is considering drafting an executive order that could be issued if no legislation passes at all.   It is unclear what could or would be contained in such an order, but the White House is indicating to Senate staff that it would be more like the Senate bill than the House bill.   We are working with sources close to the White House to confirm their strategy.Strategy going forward:Upon hearing that some industry associations were on Capitol Hill discussing \"what industry could live with\" in terms of provisions added to the Senate bill, I insisted (along with El Paso and others) that we not take such an approach, but rather remain consistent in our approach --- we support the Senate bill and only the Senate bill.   It was approved unanimously in the Senate and by 60% of the House, and if anything moves forward on an omnibus/appropriations bill, it should be the Senate bill.   Consistent with what our Senate friends are doing, we should not even recognize the Dingell/Oberstar legislation as a serious proposal, nor start accepting pieces of it as a compromise.We will be shoring up support for our position of \"if anything moves forward, it should be the Senate bill only\" with Senate supporters and leadership in the House and Senate.   We will also be working to thank the 51 Democrats who supported us in the House, and make sure they have any cover they need in case their vote becomes an issue.   In support of Senator Gorton's election troubles, we will be working to try to get media placement of op-eds that support the efforts he has waged and make sure the House Democrats shoulder the blame for the bill's defeat.   In particular, we are hopeful that Senator McCain (who has been passionate about this issue) will write op-eds that can be placed to support Gorton and others in tough races who supported the Senate bill.Congress' state of confusion over omnibus/appropriations bills and last minute politics causes the legislative activity to be extremely fluid and subject to change rapidly, so we will have no real certainty until the session is over (which now could be as late as October 20).   I will keep you posted as changes and developments occur.Jeff\n"

The council includes several prominent permanent members drawn from the   business and academic communities, to which we add distinguished guests with expertise in areas of interest to us on an ad hoc basis. Several of our top executives attend these meetings.   I am hoping that you might help us in two ways. Irwin tells me that your headquarters building is innovative and has many features that it would be well worth our while to know about and to study. Would it be possible for you to arrange a tour for a few of our executives, both from the US and the UK, say on the morning of October 30?   Second, we understand from Irwin and from the press that you have done wonders in reinvigorating and revitalizing the BA staff. I am hoping that you might be willing to share some of the secrets of your success with us, perhaps at an informal buffet lunch at our new London headquarters on October 31, or at some other time on that day that might be more convenient for you.   Let me take this opportunity to congratulate you on what you have achieved at BA, in a short time and in a tough market.   Sincerely,\n"

I intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever I can, but we need help immediately on the regulatory front - the last thing I would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the governmental approval stage-   being proactive now by bringing Jose over the wall would be my strong recommendation.Please advise.\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nI agree with Rick.   I know Jose is tied up on current business, but his input will be important.   To date we have been relying on legal analysis of required approvals etc.   That information is essential but it is, as you know, about 10% of the issue.   The far more critical considerations are how is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do about it.   I think our government affairs people are in the best position to make these assessments.---"

A press conference is planned for Friday by IEP.   Bowen, who heads up the first committee that this bill will go through will have hearings on this bill on Tuesday at the earliest.Jan S-J asked every QF to fax to IEP a description of all QF generation and the zip code of each project so that they can begin lobbying specific legislators.   A significant PR push is planned.SBX 47 is opposed by SCE.   PG&amp;E's position appears more ambivalent.   One angle would be to try to get PG&amp;E to support Enron's swap/SC language and make inclusion of such language a condition of PG&amp;E's support.GAC\n"

Tax is.In summary, if a person is terminated from Enron or one of its subsidiaries as a result of a business reorganization, the forfeiture penalty is waived.   The amount of the waived forfeiture penalty is added to that individuals income as salary (imputed income) and is subject to Federal, State, and FICA taxes. V&amp;E and I recommend that the changes are effective as of now and not retroactive back to the start of the plan.   A retroactive date would weaken the plan as it stands and take out some of the teeth that we put in at its inception.JimX 3 5673 ---Original Message---From:   Brown, Suzanne   Sent: Wednesday, June 13, 20001 5:53 PMTo: Sandt, Jim; Butcher, Sharon; Pieper, Kalen; Smith, Gary; Barnard, Marla; Oxley, David; Jones, Robert W.- HR Exec; Olson, Cindy; Lynch, Drew; Joyce, Mary; Barrow, CynthiaCc: Davis, Sarah A.; Newhouse, Marie; Boudreaux, ElizabethSubject: RE: Clickathome - Proposed treatment for Involuntary Terminations - Business Reorganizations To all, the severance pay plan is not affected.   Please refer to the original language :Reason for this email: Gain consensus on this change Business Issue : Find alternatives to the PC forfeiture penalty when an employee who has participated in the Clickathome program is involuntarily terminated   due to business reorganizations.Proposed Alternative : Replace the cash forfeiture penalty with imputed income to be reported on year-end W-2.   The alternative defers or removes the cash impact to the   employee.   Employees moving to other Enron units who currently do not participate in the program such as PGE and EFS will not be required to   report the PC as imputed income as long as they remain in a wholly-owned division.New Process :   Requires payroll administrationTiming:   Effective immediately.   Question:   Do you want this retroactive to program inception?Other Applications: The imputed income option could be expanded to all types of terminations. However, in doing so, would allow easier entry into the program   when an employee is planning to leave the company voluntarily.   No recommendation at this time to change the forfeiture penalty for these other   types of separations.Please email me with your vote as Kalen is interested in enacting this change as soon as possible for the current redeployment candidates.   Thanks.\n"

My apologies if I mischaracterize anyone'sposition.   NPCC and ERCOT have signed the agreement.   ECAR has stated itwill sign the agreement at the signing ceremony on March 30.   SPP isprepared to sign the agreement, but doesn't want to be the only one it itspart of the Eastern Interconnection to do so.   FRCC was not on the call,but has previously stated that it is prepared to sign so long as at leastsix regions sign.   MAPP and MAIN have indicated that they prefer to developtheir program with their own members before they sign the NERCagreement.   WSCC may need to consider the matter at its Board meeting inearly April.   SERC has the matter under consideration.   I have not heardfrom MAAC, but it has a meeting scheduling for March 29.I want to share with you my concern for the climate in Washington.   In thepast few weeks I have had occasion to speak with a number of people onCapitol Hill and in the new Administration.   All are very concerned aboutwhat might happen this summer.   If a serious incident occurs, I am quitesure that Congress will legislate very quickly---whether it will legislatewisely is a different question.   We have the opportunity with thisagreement for the industry to take charge of its own destiny.   If Congressacts it may well assign a very central role to the Federal government totake direct responsibility for reliability.   There are those in theDepartment of Energy who are pushing for such a role.   Congressman Bartonis talking of the possibility of emergency legislation, possibly within thenext few weeks.   If the industry pulls together, I believe we can forestalldirect governmental controls, just as in 1965.   If the industry does notstep up, then Congress may well assign the responsibility elsewhere.The CTG recommended to the Board that a critical mass of six Regions signonto the agreement before it goes forward.   For those Regions that areconsidering developing their own programs with their members before theysign the agreement, with the view of having the CAPG determine in advancewhether their programs meets the requirements of the agreement, I ask youto consider this:   If we don't get a critical mass of Regions to sign, thenthe CAPG may not come into existence.The NERC/Regions agreement is really an undertaking by the regions to workto develop their own regional compliance and enforcement program with theirmembers.   My request remains that each of the regions sign the agreement bythe March 30 Board meeting.   That will assure that we are able to make thegovernance changes that we have all been working for.   If any region isunable to sign by March 30, then use of the letter of intent would be a wayto demonstrate support for the program.   That may be enough to satisfythose who have stated that moving forward on the compliance program is acondition to their support of the governance changes.Thanks very much for your consideration of the program and all the workyou've put into this transition so far.   Please let me know if you havequestions or if there is anything that we can do from here to be ofassistance to you.\n"

He is being succeeded by Herve Jouanjean with Michel Servozas number 2. Does anyone have biographical information on HerveJouanjean???Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here formeetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI andJapaneese counterparts. Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energyinterest involved as members of Andrew's group and they have expressed nointerest in liberalized energy services. This would seem to be anopportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of theirinterests and possibly the drilling people.During the ISAC 13 meeting last week, USTR Peter Collins reported that theWTO Working Party Dealing With China's accession had expressed concern withthe recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions andin the case of energy services and possibly e-commerce there are pricecontrols.   We were told that a number of law firms in Washington areopposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informedISAC 13 members should they have a view on price controls.Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the Chinaaccession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues.   You need to let usknow if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controlsfor energy services and e-commerce services.Joe\n"

What Derrick and I have agreed with regard to counsel selection is:   gov't/reg affairs picks the counsel we want to use and he retains a veto, which has rarely if ever been exercised.   Once we have retained counsel we will use that counsel on other regulatory projects unless the legal department starts to have a problem with the firm (eg because they represent someone against us in litigation).   Again, I don't recall this ever being an issue.   It seems to work:   outside counsel gets the message that we will look dimly on any firm that squares off against us and we select the most qualified counsel on our issues.Mark Schroeder@ECT09/01/2000 06:18 AMTo: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: 20001 budgetYou should be receiving today a copy of my draft budget proposed for Enron Europe for 20001.   I understand from Nick that they are doing their own budget for Enron Japan, which I will see only after the fact.MOST IMPORTANTLY, you will see that I am budgetting to pay a substantial sum for legal fees.   I will be proposing to John Sherriff, Michael Brown (our new COO and former General Counsel, which will make my proposal doubly problematic), and to Mark Evans (current General Counsel) that I pay/manage our outside regulatory counsel.   We can discuss (rather than do a lengthy e-mail), but having this function managed by Legal (and Houston/Jim Derrick rejecting our choice of counsel in important cases), is increasingly a problem.   I believe this will mirror what you do in the USA, e.g., Dan Watkiss, and hope that I can count on your support for this change.   thansk   mcs\n"

H.R. 4908 is sponsored by Subcommittee ChairmanCharles Canady (R-FL-12) and cosponsored by subcommittee member Bob Barr(R-GA-7).   The bill would require employers to notify employees aboutelectronic monitoring.   The National Association of Manufacturers urges itsmembers to notify their employees about internal monitoring practices.Nevertheless, H.R. 4908 is being placed on a fast track that could allow formany unintended consequences.   The NAM urges you to contact the Subcommitteeon the Constitution at (202) 2226-7680 and subcommittee members (see below)to urge postponement.Message:The September 6 hearing on H.R. 4908 was not well advertised and did notinclude the views and concerns of employers.Because of the nature of computers and other electronic equipment, any\"electronic monitoring\" bill has to be carefully written so that it does notinterfere with other fiduciary and legal responsibilities of employers.This is far too important an issue to \"rush through\" the process.For more information, call Larry Fineran at (202) 637-3174 or e-mail him atlfineran@nam.org.Subcommittee Members:Charles Canady (R-FL-12), Chair --- (202) 2225-1252Henry Hyde (R-IL-6) --- (202) 2225-4561Asa Hutchinson (R-AR-3) ---   (202) 2225-4301Spencer Bachus (R-AL-6) ---   (202) 2225-4921Bob Goodlatte (R-VA-6) ---   (202) 2225-5431Bob Barr (R-GA-7) ---   (202) 2225-2931William Jenkins (R-TN-1) ---   (202) 2225-6356Lindsay Graham (R-SC-3) ---   (202) 2225-5301Mel Watt (D-NC-12), Ranking Member --- (202) 2225-1510Maxine Waters (D-CA-35) ---   (202) 2225-22201Barney Frank (D-MA-4) ---   (202) 2225-5931John Conyers (D-MI-14) ---   (202) 2225-5126Jerry Nadler (D-NY-8) ---   (202) 2225-5635\n"

Twice in the last three months I have run into the Chairman of AGA who has taken my head off for Enron not renewing its AGA dues. I understand that the dues had been paid by   Stan Horton who had decided that the pipeline group with INGAA representing it had no need for and received no benefit from the membership. I guess a few years back, when AGA \"kicked\" the pipelines out, they renegotiated the dues into some type of sub membership for around 85K.AGA approached the gas marketing team and talked to Mike Roberts about renewing the membership and maintaining relations with his customers and later to Jeff Shankman who passed them off to some other person and never got back to them as promised.   This is a heads up to tell you that Bob Catell of Brooklyn Union fame- one of Enron's oldest customers and friends will be calling Lay.It seems to me that pro rating the dues among ENA and EGM and maybe GPG might be a solution. Anyhow, I promised to pass on the complaint. Thanks.\n"

Page?A - 1=20\r   Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls\rBy Dale Kasler\rBee Staff Writer\r(Published July 3, 20001)=20\rConfused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,=20\rgenerators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state=\r=20\rwas nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.=20\rThe confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Sta=\rge=20\r1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the fir=\rst=20\rtime since they went into effect June 21.=20\rOut-of-state generators pulled about 1,5000 megawatts of electricity off the=\r=20\rtable at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of=\r=20\runcertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy=\r=20\rRegulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for=\r=20\rthe state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity fo=\rr=20\rthe state's financially distressed utilities.=20\r\"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusio=\rn=20\rover the FERC order,\" Hidalgo said. \"We saw 1,5000 megawatts disappear.\"=20\rThe problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced=20\rCalifornia to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.=20\rRolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.=20\rMost California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a=20\rvariable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power=\r=20\rmarket. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiti=\rng=20\rprofits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.=\r=20\rAnd as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap=\r=20\rwill fall could lead to unexpected shortages.=20\r\"That's the risk that you run (with price controls),\" said Arthur O'Donnell=\r,=20\reditor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. \"People want any kind o=\rf=20\rcertainty at all.\"=20\rHidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute import=\rs=20\rfrom the Bonne=0F'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that marke=\rts=20\rgovernment-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state=\r=20\rwent into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts ar=\re=20\rordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.=20\rThe blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.=20\rFERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The=20\rprice fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient=\r=20\rplant operating in California during a \"power alert\" declared by the=20\rIndependent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid=\r.=20\rWhen there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was=\r=20\restablished during the latest alert.=20\rUntil Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour i=\rn=20\rCalifornia. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early=20\rafternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7=20\rpercent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.=20\rBecause of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many=20\rCalifornia power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew=\r=20\rby how much until the price was posted by the ISO.=20\rThe ceiling for California fell to about $777 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $=\r98=20\rin two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent=20\rpremium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a cred=\rit=20\rrisk in selling to the state.=20\rO'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every=\r=20\rtime the ISO declares a power alert.=20\rIn-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO.

It was the first such emergency since=\r=20\rMay 31.\r???Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=20\rintended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a pow=\rer=20\remergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that=20\rapplies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.=20\r???The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run th=\re=20\rmost inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California=\r=20\rgrid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.\r???But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price =\ris=20\rsupposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparentl=\ry=20\rdrove away sellers, Hart said.\r???Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting=\r=20\rthe old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that ha=\rd=20\rcommitted to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon=20\rbacked out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of=\r=20\rOregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit =\rof=20\rthe San Diego-based energy conglomerate.\r???Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare =\ra=20\rStage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy=20\rcommission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be a=\rnd=20\rwhen it should take effect. They got no answer.\r???Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to=20\rclarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations pow=\rer=20\rsuppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.\r???Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when i=\rt=20\ris set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price=\r=20\rof natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped latel=\ry.\r???Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators=\r=20\rhad anticipated.

My feeling is that we should review its composition after the election --- we may lose Larry or want to add a Democrat (Laura Tyson?); we can take a hard look at who is contributing and who isn't etc.My agenda would be:1. What can be done to increase the value to Enron? As I see it we have two purposes: to create fans of and spokepersons for the company in important fora, and to enrich management's understanding of the outside world (what it is like, and how it views some of the problems that Enron faces).2. What are the likely topics that it would be valuable for Enron to discuss in 20001, as best we can judge things at this early point in time? 3. What should the composition of the group consist of in 20001, given whatever we decide in #1 and #2 above.4. How can we maximize the chance of achieving Ken's objective of attracting outside guest speakers? Advance scheduling? Fees? And what sorts would we like to attract?I am sure there are many other items; these are designed merely to start you thinking.Let me start the bidding by suggesting November 29 or December 4, inn Washington if you happen to be in town, in Houston if that is more convenient.\n"

I am not wedded to the idea but am inclined toward at least getting the information, unless you see a problem.\tLinda Robertson\t03/13/20001 02:16 PM \t\t\t To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Andrew LundquistI got your message about Andrew.   He would be an excellent catch.   However, I see a couple of significant problems.   My guess is that Andrew is too senior for this position, particularly after having chaired the Cheney task force.   Also, I would not anticipate that he would be available for several months, if then.   We should fill this position immediately.   We are already missing opportunities because this position is vacant. As for our search, using Korn Ferry, I have narrowed the field to two very good candidates.   I am setting up time for Rick to interview these candidates next Monday.   The first candidate is Drew Maloney with Rep. Tom Delay's office.   Drew would give us enormous visibility in House Republican leadership circles, seems trustworthy, and capable of learning most of the substance of the energy portfolio.   Drew has strong networking skills, which I think would nicely fit with Tom's strategic and technical skills.   The second candidate is John Shelk, whom I have known for nearly 15 years.   John was the lead Republican staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee under Norm Lent.   John left the Committee in 19992.   Since then John has worked in the financial services and gaming industries, where he has enhanced his political and Republican networking skills.   John in very short order would have extremely strong technical skills, atlhough he has been away from the industry for eight years.   I believe both candidates bring different but very strong talents to the job.   I have a second opening for an enviromental advocate.   I am discussing with Rick the possibility of whether we could redirect one of these candidates (probably John) to that slot.   That said, please let me know if I should have Nels pursue Andrew.\n"

As you know, Reliance and ONGC owe EOGIL approximately   $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including interest on non-payment).   The arbitration notices reflected only the non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for RIL and ONGC respectively.   We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July 29th and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July 31, 2000.   This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in other means, but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the only solution in the end.   While nobody likes to file arbitration, the good news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as I can tell, at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision.   If the issue gets external, I don't know how any of the parties will respond.   Our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible, but this is India and I would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it.I will be in contact with John Ambler today to discuss the details of the submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be necessary.   While both parties were expecting the notice, it may leak into the media over the next few days.   Please defer any questions or comments to either John Ambler, Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue.   Until John advises us otherwise, our comment will be as follows;\" The parties (ONGC, Reliance and Enron Oil and Gas India Limited) have had a dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party using the guidelines as set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement.\"Mike Smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with John Ambler and the appropriate staff.

He is contacting other attorneys in the firm to follow up on this immediately.   Varnum is one of the two major west Michigan law firms and is based in Grand Rapids.   John Stokes and I have spoken.   As soon as I learn anything from our attorneys, I will be in contact with him.I also have a call into our lobbying firm, Karoub Associates.   I doubt that they could be more effective than Varnum on this one, but I want them in the loop b/c they might have some pull with key officials in Grand Rapids.I will keep you posted.From: Steven J Kean on 111/02/2000 08:52 AMTo: John Stokes/HOU/AZURIX@AZURIXcc: Janine Migden/DUB/EEES@EES, Barbara A Hueter/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: Help in Michigan   John --- I'm copying Janine and Barb on this message as they are most likely to be able to identify someone.Janine and Barb --- could one of you get in touch with John?\tJohn Stokes@AZURIX\t111/02/2000 06:45 AM \t\t\t To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: Amanda K Martin/HOU/AZURIX@AZURIX\t\t\t Subject: Help in MichiganOnce again, I come to you for help.   We were awarded a biosolids dewatering contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.   We had bid against the incumbent, a company called Synagro.   You may recall that Azurix is in litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not related.   In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to award the contract to us.   Synagro has been working to get the award overturned, and appears to have been successful.   It is not yet clear whether they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.   It is not even clear what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may be pure politics.   Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand Rapids?   We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding to a publicly advertised bid.   Price and technical qualifications were the only issues.   Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a little flat-footed.   Any suggestions?   \n"

Laird Smith and I spoke with Eric Schneidewind this afternoon.   Varnum is currently representing the city on isolated matters.   Varnum is approaching the city attorney to obtain a waiver of any conflict of interest so that they may engage in lobbying activities on Azurix's behalf.   Eric is very confident that the city attorney will issue with waiver.   Varnum made it clear that should Azurix lose the contract and wish to engage in any legal action against the city, then Azurix would not be able to use Varnum b/c of their existing relationship with the city.   John assured Eric that it is extremely unlikely that Azuriz would ever pursue legal action against the city.John Stokes has asked that Varnum deal directly with Tom Maxwell in the Edmonton office once the waiver is obtained.They will keep us posted on progress.---"

Our amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies.   The BLM made a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate, but we had reached key Senators and staff and they got nowhere.Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House Conference members.   Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the key Republicans in the House.   We've already recruited the important Democrats.   Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him.   We trust he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg, formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight --- at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even meeting to discuss the issue.We continue, though, on several other fronts:1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and Congressmen writing BLM and USFS2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest Service have not gotten the message.   Our position is that we'll be satisfied that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood EBS build is retracted.3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the longer-term issue next session.   We have no trouble finding champtions eager to own the issue4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20 companies and associations now actively engaged.   Enron chairs this initiative, with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and stature as a serious communications player.6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from the end-user perspectiveBLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused.   We don't think they've given up though, and it's likely an issue of pride at this point.   So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the full court press.Steve\n"

There are still four important issues, however:IT still cannot commit to transferring messages across domains.   This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain.No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool, WebSphere, and will use WebLogic instead.   WebLogic is required by BackWeb, although it is designed by a separate company.HR, intended to be a key user of this tool, will not use BackWeb because survey responses cannot be made anonymous.   HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys.Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain, nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator.Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time, meaning users cannot retrieve them and read them later (as they can with e-mail).   This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely, because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned.The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative, but they lack commercial sponsorship.   They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company-wide.Please let us know if you have additional questions.- er---",

This bill may or may not be subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this summer.   Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise.   The call to Barton was to:   a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit for the defeat of price caps.   I hear from lots of DC sources that we have not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.   Numerous folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's first real role in the Committee.   Thus, even though this is a very limited bill, the call made sense.   I do not think that this means we should call the White House to push the bill with them.   The bill itself still has lots of obstacles and many potential threats ahead.   \n"

We are currently looking at either October 16 or 18.   All 6,2000 Houston area members will be invited to participate, however, we expect attendance to be closer to 75-1000 people.   The ages, experiences, and business affiliation of the members will be very diverse, but all will have the common thread of business excellence.The details of this event are still being finalized; however, at our last meeting the discussion encompassed possible speakers and topics.   Overwhelmingly the team decided on Electricity Deregulation in Texas, and since I work at Enron, I was asked to assist in locating a dynamic speaker.

Kelly is on vacation now, for the next week and a half, and I wanted to check with you to make sure that it is OK to share these documents with him.   They are what Kelly reviewed with you in your initial meeting regarding the subject.   He only asked for information on the people shifting to Corp, not the people on redeployment, so I could delete that portion of these documents.   Perhaps I could only send him the first document that is about budget, but with the redeployment information taken out.Sorry to bother you, but I am concerned about doing the right thing and following protocol in Kelly's absence.Thanks, Stacy\n"

More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking over their merchant functions.   On the policy side, we are working the issue on both a state and federal level.   Whether this country does anything meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda Breathitt.   Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.   We are working the RTO process hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.   In the current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona).   I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.Hang in there.Susan J Mara08/111/2000 111:56 AMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EEScc:   Subject: CA Price capsI heard you've been raising a ruckus about our activities on the price caps --- asking us to do more.

Amy is correct in the fact that EBS is not likely to buy the software Strategy that provides a strategic, top-down focus on competitive intelligence.   However,   EBS is doing tactical competitive analysis and market research.   We are providing the business units with the information that they need to make intelligent decisions at the business unit level. Amy's view is that competitive intelligence (CI) belongs at the corporate level and that CI should drive the strategic direction of the company.   You and I both know this is not the way Enron operates.   I hope this e:mail does not sound negative but I did want you to know that EBS is providing information and intelligence to its business units --- it is just not in the context   that   Amy thinks it should be in.If you have any questions, please let me know.Rita HartfieldPhone:   713-853-5854Cell:   713-304-5428Fax:   713-646-88861rita_hartfield@enron.net\n"

If no x-ray machine is available, you should scan you mail visually, looking for the following:- Priority markings such as 'Rush', 'Personal', or 'Confidential'- Excessive postage- False or missing return address- Poorly typed or handwritten address- Incorrect titles- Addressed to titles, but no names- Misspellings of common words or names- Oily stains or discolorations- Excessive or uneven weight distribution- Excessive tape, string or twine- Rigid, uneven or lopsided envelope- Protruding wires, screws, or other metal parts- Postmark is different from the return addressThe existence of only one or two of the above characteristics is acceptable, but more than two on the same peice of mail should be considered to be suspicious, and the item should not be opened.   In case of receipt of a 'suspicious' letter or package, you should isolate the item and call your local police imediately.\n"

The intranet site will be placed on the home.enron.com webpage by Tuesday morning for all Enron employees to access. However, today, this comprehensive database is available to you for your California Power Issue needs. The database has been populated with the latest information that I have received concerning this topic and has been broken down in three categories:California Power Issues, National Power Issues and Secured Documents. It has then been broken down further into subcategories.The secured documents sections will only be accessible to those that are receiving this e-mail. Please let me know if you believe others should have access to this information. The secured document section contains all the information that I have received that Luntz Consulting has helped us develop, i.e. principals, statements, speeches and facts, as well as, talking points and other statements developed internally. These documents can be easily switched to open access to all Enron employees if you believe that these documents should not be restricted.To access the intranet site you must be logged on to the network and then go to this link:   http:///nahou-lndev02d.corp.enron.com/GovtAffa.nsf   (It is best if you copy this link and paste it in your internet Explorer or Netscape browser.)Once you are at this site you will   be able to access all articles and information that I have collected/received concerning the California Power Issue. You can navigate the site by using the links on the left hand side of the screen. While navigating this site, keep in mind that the actual interface will be changed before we go live on Tuesday morning. To access the secured documents, click on secured documents and type in your user name, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network, and then type in your password, which is the same as if you are logging onto the network. However, if you have difficulties entering this site, you will need to change your Lotus internet password. Which is very simple to do and which you will need to do regardless if you decide to use this site or not, it is all part of the current computer migration. To change your internet password, go to this link   and then hit the edit person key. Go to the last field that says internet password and type in whatever password you would like, preferably your current network login password. (In the internet password section you will see a bunch of numbers and letters, delete those and enter your new network password.) There are still some bugs that will be worked out by Tuesday, but I thought since this is such a fast moving issue it was best to get this tool out so it could be used when needed. If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-4382.Thanks,Gavin \n"

But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.In short, little has changed since yesterday.Best,Jeff\n"

Under Steve Hopper's leadership, the Chorety spill became a non-issue by Friday.   During the crisis, I collaborated with my counterpart from Shell/London, Michael Megarry, in developing a Key Messages and Internal Q&amp;As document (attached).   At the daily meeting/conference call, there was an Operations Report from the site, an analysis of the day's newspaper articles (which I handled), and discussions on how to respond to media that were reporting or airing inaccurate information that was damaging Transredes' image.   I also developed a Stakeholders Action Plan (attached) for the Incident Commander to use in organizing and monitoring team member actions taken in response to stakeholder concerns.   The Plan was updated daily by the Transredes PR Office and given to team members prior to every meeting/conference call.   The Stakeholder Report is intended to complement the Operations Report.   I also want to acknowledge the support of Karen and Dennis during the early stages of the crisis.   It was extremely helpful.Regards, Keith \n"

Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey is not totally on board.   He specifically asked about capping the forward market.   He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24 months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage of their needs from this contract.A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market (presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that generation not be cancelled in California.Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.   Specifically, what is opportunity cost?   As long as the test is not known until after the fact, there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater incentive to sell elsewhere.Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be only for one month).Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission should not institute penalties only on the load.   They claimed this was one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied to the supply side as well.   They also argued that the load could not meet the 5% test.Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of today.   The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include stranded costs.There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.   A Court battle was threatened.\tSteven J Kean\t111/13/2000 08:51 AM \t\t\t To: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J Mara/SFO/EEES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Re: Comments on FERC November 1 orderThere are a few other issues we need to look into:Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO --- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.

Narrow because for every significant activity there are only a few who are in the loop and \"impermanent\" because very little information is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).   This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication.   We now have some solutions emerging --- software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML format on company intranet sites.

Especially if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron)   they take home every night and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well.   Since Enron has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion.I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line.   How can we (\"Enron\") be a world leading company if we don't have leading world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own.I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding expenses such as these.   Just because a person is an executive of the company why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can?Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.

Spears, the other Republican appointee is not at all free market, in my view.   I would not like this to mentioned anywhere else, but I have found that the farm reps on the Commission may sound deregulatory but are not, and have been really troublesome without a good free market person on board.   And there are no truly free market persons on   board at the Commission (every single other agricultural rep that I worked with on the Commission were trouble, even though they claimed to be deregulatory --- and they were far worse before I got there and after I left.)   I visited with Newsome a day before Inauguration, and I was appalled at what they were planning to do concerning agency structure --- that would have elevated the regulatory lawyers and diminished the role of the economists at the agency.   Misguided and showed to me a lack of understanding of how organizational structures can affect what comes out of an agency.   I am often at odds with \"the industry view\" regarding CFTC issues.   I don't think the futures exchanges, who have a lot of power, necessarily are pro-competition; and many of the non-exchange folks who lobby on CFTC issues are Washington or New York (Democrat - which is why they want to involve Ken at this level) lawyers who do not understand markets and who are more interested in being able to claim influence or impact.   The CFTC is in awful shape --- the quality of staff is horrendous, and the Commission is relying on some of the worst people for their policy work (same folks that Brooksley Born used, same folks who have advocated more regulation of the OTC market for years).   Many quality folks do not want the job as Chairman because it's been such a backwater.   I am looking for some good folks.   Have   at least one person who would be good at that job.   And it's not Newsome.   Please do not share this information with the usual folks, as they hate me anyway (I'm too free market and have argued against their \"fixes\").   Sorry for this scathing review, but this is an important appointment.   Wendy\n"

Drayton McLane will attend.   They are looking for $1000 to host or $5000 sponsor.   Congressman Edwards has been very helpful with our defense procurement issues, and we have contributed to him recently.   The Congressman's main request was to include Ken Lay's name on their invitation which Ken Lay graciously agreed to do so the Congressman is most pleased.   Thus, the remaining request to attend and give additional money is up to you, although if we have room in our budget and Ken Lay or Tom White were available, I would recommend their attendance.\n"

I realize that there is some concern that Wanda is a litigation threat, so for the purposes of soliciting legal advice and in anticipation of litigation, I am forwarding my recollection of today's meeting to you:Wanda remains very emotional about what she perceives as \"unfair and discriminatory\" treatment.   When I asked her what she meant specifically (and did she intend those terms to have their legal meaning), she said that she did not intend the legal meaning of those terms;   rather, she, on   a \"personal\" level,   felt that the company should have treated her better.   She mentioned specifically: that no one ever called to explain in detail why she had not been further promoted at Enron or given more responsibility at Enron, that she viewed the job in Sally Beck's organization as unsatisfactory (because Sally should be treated as a peer, not a superior), and that she felt as though she did not have the support of upper management of the company.I described several options for her:Take the job she was offered in Sally Beck's organization;Take the job in Rick Buy's organization (I said I would have to talk to Rick again)Take severence under the standard package;Take severence as a \"business reorg\" but consult with Enron for a period.At first she seemed most interested in the fourth option (although she wasn't particularly happy about any of the   alternatives), but at the end of the discussion expressed interest in the second option.A large part of the conversation involved discussion of Wanda's complaints about how she had been treated.   Most of Wanda's concerns focussed on jobs she did not get, or jobs she felt were taken from her, reduced scope of control, and the fact that she felt that her supervisors did not communicate with her sufficiently prior to or subsequent to making their decisions about job assignments.   I suggested that there were likely two sides to the story and that most of the problem was insufficient communication or perhaps some insensitivity.   I also pointed out that in all my conversations I heard good things about her performance and had no indication that anyone had treated her unfairly.Wanda did complain about many things, but never once complained about her pay at Enron.Mary, these are my recollections from today.   Do you have anything to add?\n"

We can communicate changes by email, or I'll be happy to arrange a short conference call.   If possible, I would like to distribute this by Wednesday or Thursday of this week.   After the four of us reach consensus, I suggest we preview Cindy (and maybe the HR heads) prior to distributing.   You will note that based on conversations I had with Skilling last week (where he emphasized his desire that we have one program, rather than a fractured program by business unit), I have added a review of the business unit distributions to the final meeting where we discuss the top perfomers.   I've also added Janet Dietrich (tent.) and another EES person (tbd) to the AA Committee, since they have a large group of AAs and no representation on the committee.   Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, and thanks for your help.   Ted and Terry did all the hard work.Regards,BillyClick Print Preview or print a hard copy - it's easier to read.We do not have the Europe groups included.   Should probably include, or note in the memo itself that info is forthcoming.\n"

These challenges imply the solutions we are proposing: a professional partnership model which provides opportunity and compensation incentives to attract and retain top talent and encourage cooperation across the company; capturing and exploiting knowledge within the organization; and a more formalized approach to business building through an accelerator.I will be in California on Monday, but let's try to set up one more meeting before we get together with Jeff.

Similar letters were delivered by Greenpeace Europe in native languages to Enron's offices in the UK, Netherlands, Spain, and Belgium.I have attached a copy of one of the letters below.   All the questions are the same in each.I have drafted a response with the goals of:1)   Being responsive to Greenpeace without being defensive or without \"greenwashing.\"   We have an already-published public \"statement\" on climate change and a very positive, solution-oriented story to tell, with many facts and accomplishments to back up our statements.   I think our letter can land in the stack that they consider \"positive\" responses, and not in the stack of non-responses or \"we don't care\" responses.2)   Steering away from directly answering the no-win questions about \"Kyoto.\"   I think we can respond to the letter in a way that provides meaningful answers to the general themes of the letter.   I have discussed this with many of you already, but I strongly feel that we should not get dragged down into debates over what we like/dislike, support/oppose about Kyoto...we'll quickly get into questions we can't now answer, and may never be able to answer.   I'd prefer it if we rise above the politics of the issue and look solution-oriented by saying counties and companies should continue to be engaged in this important issue.3)   Developing corporate-wide messages that we can use in multiple applications --- arming our PR and govt. affairs advocates with a tight script to use in their efforts; responding to shareholder inquiries and annual meeting Q&amp;A;   Ken Lay or other executive speeches and presentations; something for our Corporate Responsibility annual report.   Sorry for the long preamble, but climate change has become a very sensitive issue of late, and our message/strategy needs to be very coordinated and we need to have one clear set of statements that everyone in the company can understand and use.   With that said, I also believe that these messages should be used very carefully, as the subject matter is complex and straying too far from the basics can be dangerous.   We should designate one or two clear spokespeople that can answer any follow up to the Greenpeace letter by press or policymakers, and really stick to the boundaries of what's in our response letter.There is also the issue of customizing responses from the European offices, using this letter as a template and adding a few examples of Enron good deeds in the local areas.   I am not opposed to doing so, but would again appreciate being able to review these responses before they go.   Please let me know if you have other views.I would like to send our response by early next week, maybe even Monday 4/23 if we can turn it around that fast.   Thank you for your input and assistance and I look forward to your reply.Jeff Jeffrey KeelerDirector, Environmental StrategiesEnronWashington DC office - (202) 4666-9157Cell Phone (203) 464-1541\n"

It comes across as moderate in tone--- although probably no one else will ask to leave the rate freeze in place. I have a legal question --- Under AB 1890, I don't see anyway that the CPUC can raise rates without ending the rate freeze first.   Am I missing something? So, how is it clear that the CCPUC can raise the rates on Feb 1?   It's clear,however,   that once the retained assets are valued that the rates can be changed.\tJeff Dasovich\tSent by: Jeff Dasovich\t12/26/2000 01:15 PM \t\t\t To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EEES@EES, Eric Letke/DUB/EEES@EES, George McClellan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@ENRON, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jennifer Rudolph/HOU/EEES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kevin McGowan/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Lisa Yoho/NA/Enron@ENRON, Lysa Akin/PDX/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Roger Yang/SFO/EEES@EES, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Stoness/HOU/EEES@EES, skean@enron.com, Stuart Staley/LON/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EEES@EES, Wanda Curry/HOU/EEES@EES, MDay@GMSSR.com, Robert C Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mike D Smith/HOU/EEES@EES\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: DRAFT talking points for California PUC Hearings on the 27th/28th Attached is a draft of the talking points for the Commission's hearings.

In fact, they wanted a few more mitigants put in and then shot down, anticipating Jeff Skilling-type questions.   Thus, this regulatory risk idea if done in depth for each region/project, may be a bigger service for Enron than you guys had ever anticipated.   They also thought of one more tack to take on the renegotiation issue to figure out how far we could go.   Good deal.

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego.   Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.   Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.   The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets.   This session focused on Wholesale markets.   There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future.   My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market.Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present.   He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego.   He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority.The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch.   Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.   No questions were posed by members of the audience.   Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of:1.   Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley2.   Dr. William Hogan-Harvard3.   Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)4.   David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees5.   Dr. Gene Coyle6.   Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon SorbonneThe panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent.   While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.   The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.   None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.   There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.   I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.   Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.   He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability.   There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.   The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.   This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role.   Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods.   All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego.Today's panel included representatives from SDG&amp;E, SCE and PG&amp;E, TURN, UCAN and ORA.   While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.SCE/PG&amp;E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze.   SDG&amp;E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply.   SDG&amp;E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases.UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial.   He mentioned that C&amp;I customers are experience difficulties as well.   TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts.   Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested.   In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.

Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee hearing.2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - they wanted to gut all the expediting siting   language with regards to all facilities except for the peaking plants.   Rate Cap related bills1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or tomorrow. SDG&amp;E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press release. The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/000. The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the energy componentThe bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB22290.The bill focuses only on SDG&amp;E customers and our major principals are the following. The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, such as schools and hospitals.   The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 20001.The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates provided by the rate cap.   \n"

Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. \"We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money,\" said Larry Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. \"We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it, let's pay for it.\" Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he said, \"were wildly high.\" \"The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, \" Maviglio said. \"Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities, you can't conclude anything.\" The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&amp;E and Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion in debt. PG&amp;E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies. \"The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall,\" said John Nelson, a PG&amp;E spokesman. \"Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large.\" Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's energy situation to ratepayers --- and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor. COST VS. OUTAGESIf given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. \"I don't like either choice,\" said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store. \"But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the blackouts.\" Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within \"the existing rate structure\" --- a stealthy way of saying that January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place. But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. \"For the good of California, it's inevitable,\" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry association. Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. \"It's like gasoline,\" he said. \"I don't like paying higher prices for gasoline, but that's the price of doing business.\" Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. \"If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it,\" said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty. \"But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling blackouts.\" \"I'd rather have blackouts,\" agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. \"I don't want to pay rates that are so much higher.\" NOT EVERY COST PALATABLEThis is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way. Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond. \"Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation,\" said Tom Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison. Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to do so. Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures. \"It adjusts consumer behavior,\" Higgins said. \"People want to get their bills back down.\" RATES' EFFECT ON USAGEHe and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor --- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. \"It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this,\" Higgins said. Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear: No, no, no. \"No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals,\" said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. \"We need to get back to a regulated system.\" Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates, which delivered about $8000 million to consumers, his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento. \"We've paid too much already,\" Rosenfield said. \"A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease.\" However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. \"Big users should pay more,\" he said after a moment's reflection. \"I'm open to a tiered system but only if it's fair.\" Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis. MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATESClearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months, if not longer. PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. \"I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation,\" she said. \"People who use a whole lot of power should pay more.\" The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. \"That way, you have more convenience and electricity, more stability,\" she said. But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate increases and rolling blackouts. She's moving to Texas.

Metropolitan Desk; Section B   Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation   By KIRK JOHNSON   09/26/2000   The New York Times   Page 1, Column 2   c. 2000 New York Times Company   New Yorkers heard a lot this summer about why their electricity bills were going up and   why a new generation of power plants was needed, and the message centered on one   word: demand.   Millions of new air-conditioners, computers and other gadgets are humming, blinking and   draining electricity from the power pool, utility executives and state energy officials said   over and over again. The 40 percent jump in electricity rates that many in the region were   assessed in August was only a hint of what could lie ahead, those officials suggested, if   residents did not accept more power plants in their neighborhoods.   What the public was not told was that the people framing the argument for building power   plants have an abiding interest in selling more electricity. Nor was the public told that the   means already existed to dampen demand and reduce the amount of new power needed, if   the political will could be exerted.   Before New York's energy markets were deregulated, beginning in 19998, the state required   companies like Consolidated Edison to reduce demand in the system --- through energy   efficiency measures, for example --- if that choice was cheaper than building a new plant.   Under deregulation , that requirement has been lost. In an open market, every participant   wants to sell more energy, and the government agencies in New York and other   deregulated states that once compelled companies to think of alternatives have become   silent or powerless.   '''The reliability problems and price spikes in the last two years have led to a simplistic set   of solutions: build more power plants,''' said Richard Cowart, director of the Regulatory   Assistance Project, a nonprofit energy policy institute in Montpelier, Vt., that works with   state regulators and utilities.   On the new playing field, Mr. Cowart and other experts said, the incentives are all   one-sided.   Power generating companies have no motive to encourage people to use less energy or to   use it more efficiently because the most money is to be made when demand is at its peak.   And electricity delivery companies make more money by sending more electricity through   their wires. '''The incentive to sell more electricity is overwhelming,''' Mr. Cowart said.   Certainly, demand for electricity is rising in New York and across the country, and most   experts agree that some added generating capacity is needed. And New York State's top   electricity official, Maureen O. Helmer, chairwoman of the Public Service Commission, has   emphasized in her recent speeches that conservation and efficiency measures must be   part of the solution to rising demand.   The problem, environmental groups and energy analysts say, is that in an arena in which   government has taken a step back through deregulation , it is harder for regulators to   make those opinions count.   Given the tone of the debate in New York and the sharp jump in prices this summer, it   would be easy for the public to think that the region's energy situation is worse than it   actually is. Most long-term projections for the region say that demand will increase less in   New York State and New York City than in the nation as a whole during the next 10 to 15   years. New York, it turns out, is not an energy hog.   The most recent official long-term projection for New York, called the State Energy Plan,   issued in late 19998, said the state could get by with only a very modest expansion in   generating capacity for the next 10 years, or no expansion at all if the levels of electricity   that utilities are required to hold in reserve could be modified.   The rate of growth in demand is also slowing down, not accelerating. Within the territory   served by Consolidated Edison, which includes all of New York City and its northern   suburbs, peak demand, the highest single moment of energy use on the heaviest day of the   year, rose by 1.7 percent a year from the mid-19990's to the end of the decade. In the new   century, that growth rate is expected to be 1.2 percent a year.   '''It will be more modest,''' one senior Con Ed official said.   The main implication of those projections, economists and energy analysts say, is that   most of the increased capacity proposed for New York City may not be needed at all, at   least to meet new demand. In the Con Ed service area, meeting a 1.2 percent growth in   demand through new supply alone would require an increased capacity of 5000 to 750   megawatts over the next five years. Developers and power plant builders have proposed a   total increase six to eight times greater than that in the next three years alone.   '''No one plant can make the argument that it's really needed,''' said Ashok Gupta, an energy   economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private conservation group. '''Like   malls, power plants are now being built for market share.'''   Predicting energy demand is notoriously difficult. In the early 1970's, for example, the   accepted wisdom was that energy use would continue to grow at the rapid pace that it had   in the 1960's. Academics and utility industry officials said the country might need 1,000   nuclear plants by the turn of the century.   But the oil shocks of the mid-1970's and early 1980's forced the introduction of   energy-efficiency measures that made those forecasts worthless. Energy use as a   percentage of the nation's economy, called energy intensity, began declining and has done   so ever since.   Some energy officials have said the problem of rising prices and the overwhelming focus on   supply is the result of a still-new electricity market that is not yet functioning as intended.   Theorists who had envisioned competition as the door to a golden age of consumer choice   had predicted that companies specializing in demand reduction --- they sell ways to cut   energy use through technology or better management --- would compete with companies   selling supply. But that has not happened yet. Part of Con Ed's prediction of more modest   growth in demand in coming years is based on the expectation that demand-management   companies will emerge within the next few years, company officials said.   But state regulatory officials also made the political decision in the late 19990's to reduce   spending for conservation and efficiency measures. The state, which once led the region in   financing for alternatives to new supply --- an effort that included television commercials   urging people to think about saving energy --- now spends about a third as much per capita   as most states in the Northeast, including Connecticut and New Jersey, according to   figures from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.   Last month, a report filed with the State Public Service Commission recommended an   increase in financing for the efficiency program. The report was produced by representatives   of the electricity industry, working alongside consumer and environmental groups. But the   state's utilities, including New York State Electric and Gas, Niagara Mohawk and Con Ed,   refused to support the final report because they were unhappy with its conclusions.   ''' Deregulation undermined the role of utilities in promoting energy efficiency,''' said Edward   A. Smeloff, the executive director of the Pace Law School Energy Project, a research and   advocacy group that helped write the report. As electricity companies have become more   conscious of the bottom line under deregulation , Mr. Smeloff said, demand-reduction   programs have become a threat to profits.   For utilities that buy most of their power from other companies, moving more electricity   through the wires has become the primary way to increase profits, Mr. Smeloff said. '''That's   the business,''' he added.   Utility officials say that much of their demand problems come down to one hour each year,   that moment of peak demand when consumers are using the most electricity. To a great   degree, planning revolves around the need to have adequate supply for that crucial moment   so as to avoid blackouts. But experts like Mr. Smeloff say the tools already exist to   dampen those peaks, and reduce prices to consumers as well, if only a constituency   existed to push for the changes.   Many business and residential energy uses are routine and could be postponed for a few   hours to dampen load on peak days, a plan that efficiency experts say would be particularly   easy in New York City commercial buildings where energy use is centrally controlled and   monitored. In England, one electricity provider created lower rates for consumers who ran   appliances like washing machines and dishwashers in off-peak hours. The program became   so popular that power use in the middle of the night went up significantly during the   discount-pricing window.   Environmentalists also worry that increasing power capacity beyond the real demand in   New York could create a kind of self-fueling spiral. If too many new plants are built, they   say, prices will probably fall, encouraging people to use more electricity, while at the same   time reducing incentives to save energy or use more efficient products.   In New York and elsewhere in the country, much of the growth in demand is being driven by   the spread of air-conditioning, especially from people buying extra units to cool more parts   of their homes. Last year, Con Ed began a kind of visual history project in which employees   began regularly photographing 90 apartment buildings in New York City and counting the   number of window air-conditioners. In one year, the total went up by 5 percent.   Some energy experts say more air-conditioning could further increase the spurts in demand   that could in turn lead to more power plants, which many scientists say are prime sources   of the greenhouse gases blamed for global warming.   '''We have hotter summers because of greenhouse gases and more greenhouse gases   because of more air-conditioning,''' said Joseph Romm, the executive director of the Center   for Energy and Climate Solutions, a nonprofit consulting institute based in Virginia. '''It would   certainly be ironic if people decided that the solution was more power plants.'''   Chart: '''LEDGER: Efficiency Plans''' While New York State makes plans to increase its   electric power supply, it is doing less to promote the efficient use of existing power.

True customer choice proves otherwise. My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine.   One of these customers is a   paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of homes.   When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to do.   As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and residential customers didn't hear a word about \"brownouts.\" The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the regulatory elite.   It's proving true in Maine, why not give New York and other states the same choice?Dan AllegrettiEnron Corp.If you like it, send it to the Letters to the Editor section at the New York Times.

I think the referendum is very important for the city and will help us continue to show Houston as a significant metropolitan area.   I am not convinced that the ultimate form of the deal for minority participation in Enron Field was, in fact, what was intended.   In that agreement, Aramark owns all of the concessions, but has a 30% profit share with minorities.   My understanding is that there are no minority owned businesses in that deal.I would like to communicate this sentiment, but I would also, certainly like to reinforce Enron's position.Thanks,Mark\"Richard R.

This is the same commitment thatwe received from the Rockets in 1999.   We received a commitment from thesports authority and the mayor's office that the minority participation goalof 30% will be included in the contract.   We have met with Celena Garza andcommunicated with Al Luna our interests and they have expressed theirsupport for our position.   We have also asked Sen. Mario Gallegos for hissupport and received it.We are in the process of confirming that our language calling for such goalhas been included in the final document and that Al Luna and Celena Garzaare sufficiently satisfied with the language, which will be voted on laterthis week.Once confirmed, Sonny Flores, Chairman of the Economic Development Committeehas recommended to Massey that the Chamber be prepared to offer some sort ofpublic statement in support or not supporting a referendum to build thearena.   (We have been asked to address the Construction Committee of thesports authority by Billy Burge and Wayne Smith)   Sonny has indicated thatonce we have a confirmation from Al and Celena, our interests should besufficiently covered and that supporting the referendum would be good forHispanic businesses.Massey has asked that I poll the board for its input and get a majoritycommitment from the board so as to move forward in offering support or nosupport for the referendum.   Ordinarily, this would be discussed andconsidered at a meeting of the Board of Directors, however, since the sportsauthority posted its meeting notice (72 hours prior to meeting) and is readyto proceed with its approval of the Letter Agreement with the HoustonRockets we are seeking input in this manner.I am attaching a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Chamberand the Sports Authority for you review.   There have been no revisions tothe last copy that was circulated at the past Executive Committee meeting atTony Grijalva's office.Massey has asked that you respond with your input, suggestions and positionfor or not for the chamber offering its support for the arena via e-mailwithin 24 hours of this notice.   The chamber's position will be determinedby the majority of those respondents to this e-mail by no later than 4:000p.m. CDT on Wednesday, August 2, 2000. - Sports Authority MOU, July 20, 2000.doc\n"

We write to urg=\re=20\ryou and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable=\r=20\rshortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in t=\rhe=20\relectric power industry.   It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulato=\rry=20\rCommission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a=20\rcompetitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supply=\r=20\rof power at the lowest possible cost to consumers.\r There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that t=\rhe=20\rpower supply in the U.S. remains sufficient and is available at reasonable=\r=20\rprices.   For example, you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in t=\rhe=20\rnation=01,s electricity gird.   Under the current system, FERC regulations a=\rllow=20\rmany companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their=20\rtransmission lines by competing electricity suppliers.   The result of this=\r=20\rpolicy is shortages, blackouts and skyrocketing prices.   Like the interstat=\re=20\rhighway system, FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to=20\ranother just as freely as motorists do.   All electricity suppliers should=\r=20\rhave the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power =\rto=20\rwhere it is most needed.\r FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers=01, reliance on spot and=\r=20\rshort-term electricity markets for power supply.   Instead, FERC should urge=\r=20\rsuppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term=20\rcontracts.   Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers=\r=20\rfrom unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating.\r We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these=\r=20\rreforms.   Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more=20\rreliable and economical.=20\r Very truly yours,\r   \n"

Both are looking at information sharing mechanism to mitigate risks to IT systems.   The Banking &amp; Finance sector has been operating an information sharing and analysis center (ISAC) for over a year.   Discussions with members of the banking and finance sector indicate it has value.   If Enron is a part of the oil &amp; natural gas sector, are we willing to take a leadership role and enter into a potential LLC with other Council member companies to form an ISAC for this sector? Cost to Enron would be based on number of individuals receiving alerts etc., however, it could be as low as $13K per year.   An additional cost would be to appoint an employee to the LLC's governance body to ensure Enron's needs were addressed.   Archie Dunham, CONOCO's Chairman, has agreed to champion this initiative if the Council recommends it at the 6 June   meeting.Current coordination:The legal issues have been worked by a sub-group lead by Tom Carmel, CONOCO.   Mark Holsworth, Corp. Legal has been our representative.   Recent DOJ action regarding information sharing to mitigate IT risks seems to indicate that anti-trust will not be an issue.   Steptoe &amp; Johnson, LLP have undertaken a review of the liability issues and suggested ways to mitigate them.Mike Hicks and I have been working with Mark Thibodeaux, Corp. IT Compliance, and will be meeting with Steve Kean and others in the security and IT protection efforts in next two weeks. Recommendation:Enron participate fully in the oil and natural gas sector's efforts - As Enron becomes more and more dependant on IT, having a mechanism that provides tailored vulnerability information and solutions in a \"one-stop-shop\" format is valuable and can lead to reduced insurance premiums.

We hope to have agreed on the Q&amp;A's by then and to send it out the announcement on Thursday.JohnTo be sent to:   All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,   all Global Markets and all VPs and up around the companyEnron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year including Metals,   Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),   Coal,   LNG &amp; Weather.   We see significant opportunities in each of these businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to capture these opportunities.   However, while Japan continues to make progress towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power trading remain under the current interim market structure.   Until further tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?]   Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and seller of electricity in every deregulated market.   We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market.   [deleted text] Joe Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets opportunities in Japan especially Weather,   Oil,   LNG,   Coal, and Shipping.   We expect to continue our general recruiting   of Japanese nationals and as President of Enron Japan,   Joe will continue to provide the overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate program in Japan.   The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.   Our power trading group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around Enron.   The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their efforts throughout the year.The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing power plants in Japan.   We are pleased with the progress we are making on a number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chairman.Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through Enron Metals in London.By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing the Credit Derivative business.   These employees remain in   Enron Credit , a part of Enron Europe.EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand   by year end.The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo office in the next couple of months.In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.   Jane McBride heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report   to Mark Evans, General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to Fernley Dyson in London.   The   IT, HR,   Tax and real estate teams will also continue to functionally report to London. Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government &amp; Regulatory Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick Shapiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS &amp; Industrial Markets.We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.\n"

      "body": "\nGiven the way the numbers came out, I guess we don't need the talking points, but we should still try to get to the bottom of this because we will be called on to comment to regulators and media.   Unless we have strong evidence to the contrary, it seems to me that wholesale markets are working ... they are open and they are competitive.   On the other hand, retail gas markets suffer from the same problems as electric markets ... they are not open, customers don't have effective choices and price signals don't get through, so there is no demand response when prices rise.   On the points raised in the attachment, I'm still not sure I follow point 4.   Also what does\" electric disconnect\" mean?\tJeff Dasovich\tSent by: Jeff Dasovich\t12/12/2000 02:40 PM \t\t\t To: Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Janet R Dietrich/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron, Leslie Lawner/NA/Enron@Enron, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Shelley Corman/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: Draft Talking points about California Gas marketLeslie:   Looks good.   Just a couple of comments:1. GeneralMay want to point out that the roots of California's current gas woes are the same ones causing the electric problem---combined effect of California's \"import-based\" energy policy and the state's failure to invest in in-state infrastructure.   California imports about 25% of its electricity, but about 80-90 percent of its gas supply.   California has failed to invest in the in-state infrastructure necessary to support increased gas demand over the last decade.   So we've got an interstate pipeline superhighway to the border and a dirt road of in-state transportation once you get into California.The last bullet seems to suggest that manipulation may be taking place.   Can we support that suggestion, and is it one that we want to make necessarily?   If we do suggest that manipulation may in part explain current prices, do we need to propose ways to eliminate it?   Otherwise, seems that we may be giving FERC ammunition to take action without trying to \"steer\" that action in the right direction.   Maybe I'm reading too much into the bullet.2. SpecificCompetition for gas coming to California has increased significantly.   The midwest (via Alliance) is competing away Canadian gas.   The Southwest (Nevada, Arizona) is competing away supply from the Southwest before it hits the California border.\tMary Hain@ECT\t12/12/2000 111:58 AM \t\t\t To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Draft Talking points about California Gas market---"

(collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron Energy Marketing&lt; Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland&lt; General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")&lt;&lt; Harvey,&lt;&lt;   I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and&lt; phone calls between Michael Day, on behalf of the Enron Entities, and&lt; yourself during the past few weeks.   Here is the current status as we&lt; understand it.   Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6,&lt; 2000 and October 18, 2000 (date of your confirming email) the Enron&lt; Entities have made the following document productions in response to the&lt; subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission (the&lt; \"Commission\"):&lt;&lt; * October 13, 2000   Bate Nos. Enron Entities 0001-00025 on behalf&lt; of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos. 1-111, 20.&lt;&lt; * October 27, 2000 Bate Nos. P0001-00021115 on behalf of Portland&lt; General Responsive to Request Nos. 12, 14, 16 and 18.&lt;&lt; * November 14, 2000 Bate No. Enron Entities 00026 (Diskette with&lt; EES/EEEMC retail data) Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13, 15 to 17,&lt; and 19.&lt;&lt; * November 15, 2000 Bate No. P00021116-00021117 (Diskettes with Portland&lt; General Data, which include approximate 3555,000 wholesale transactions)&lt; Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13 to 17, and 19.&lt;&lt; We believe with these productions, we have complied with the October&lt; 6-18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES/EEEMC.   As you&lt; know, these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights&lt; to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims, defenses,&lt; objections, jurisdictional or otherwise, or other responses.&lt;&lt;   We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for&lt; EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by&lt; October 27th.   However, we were also mindful of your expressed expectation&lt; that any data provided be useful and reliable.   The collection of data you&lt; requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same&lt; location nor organized as you requested it.   In fact during our review of&lt; some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the&lt; methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.&lt; When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it&lt; would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved,&lt; we informed you of the problem.   We now understand that if we cannot give&lt; you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be&lt; available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to&lt; compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission&lt; (\"FERC\").   We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data&lt; immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the&lt; immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce&lt; accurate data.&lt;&lt;   Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number&lt; of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas&lt; served on the Enron entities.   First, we understand that many other&lt; parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the&lt; detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very&lt; sound legal grounds.   Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing&lt; on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is&lt; supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes&lt; sought by other parties served.   Third, the Commission has filed its&lt; motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data&lt; from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited&lt; hearing and production schedule.   We note that the reasons stated in the&lt; motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially&lt; different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application&lt; to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.&lt; Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a&lt; tentative order as of November 1, 2000.&lt;&lt;   Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept \"most&lt; favored nation\" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests&lt; by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that&lt; was available.   However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need&lt; for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite&lt; substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate&lt; Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described&lt; intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal&lt; objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's&lt; threatened motion to compel before FERC.&lt;&lt;   We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission&lt; has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been&lt; served with subpoenas.   We understand that there is a list for those&lt; entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been&lt; delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their&lt; rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We understand that the Commission&lt; intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities that&lt; object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We deplore&lt; these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described&lt; above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating&lt; list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.&lt;&lt;   If you have and questions or comments, please do not hesitate to&lt; contact me.&lt;&lt;   Sincerely,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Gary S.&lt; Fergus===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

I think you did a good job of summarizing our discussions, both as to content and context...   I fully understand what your two most important issues are and that you are optimistic we can come together on the other issues.   Nevertheless, the details are important as to all of those issues.   I look forward to talking more both about the details and about the business elements that underlie our views of the issues.   I agree that whatever happens as to outcome, these kinds of discussions are far more beneficial than mutual demonization.   I expect to be able to talk to my principles at EEI next Monday (our Financial Conference is just finishing up in San Francisco - I understand Enron had someone there).   Once I do, I will get back to you. In the meantime, I 'm absorbing the California Order and would be glad to share impressions with you when we talk.Ed   &lt;&lt;&lt; \"Richard Shapiro\" &lt;Richard_Shapiro@enron.com&lt; 10/31/000 03:51PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Ed- Thanks again for breakfast and for the very   good discussion we had on awide- ranging set of issues. Here's where I believe we ended the discussion: 1)On the range of issues( that were addressed in the document we forwarded to youand that we worked from) that would likely be addressed next congress relativeto electricity reform, the bottom line was that while there were many issues onwhich we voiced   our diffrences, mandatory RTO participation andnon-discriminatory access to transmission,i.e;unbundling,   are the two criticalissues from our perspective. While our discussion revealed the continuingdiffrences we have on the resolution of those issues and the \" political\"hurdles EEI faces with certain of its members to reach consensus on them, weboth felt further meetings and continued discussion were   warranted . On theremaining issues ( other than the two just mentioned)   for which diffrences werearticulated and discussed, I indicated that we fully understood your concernsand that Enron was sufficiently flexible on those issues to have a high degreeof confidence that they would ultimately be   removed as a source of disagreementbetween us.   Again, I come back to the two critical issues mentioned above -those issues must be adequately addressed as laid out in our earlier documentfor this process to come to fruition and for comprehensive federal legislationto make any sense for us. With that said, remember that we were quite receptiveto appropriate incentives being included as part of mandatory RTO particpationas well as to tax concerns your members must have addressed.   We also discussed the jointCEO letter that would be sent post - election that would jointly affirm ourmutual desire to get competitive electricity markets functioning well in thenext administration   and continued to agree on the value of that effort,   Next steps( my proposal):   1) EEIprepare first draft of CEO letter for discussion.   2) Schedule next meeting for more intensive discussionon key issues ( 4- 6 hour meeting) Ed,thanks again for taking the time to continue the dialogue- despite the distance(on issues) that still exists between our respective organizations, I feel thatthis is a doable exercise if the necessary commitment is made to the process. Nomatter the ultimate outcome, I believe that one positive result   that has andwill continue to come from this process is a better understanding of ourrespective viewpoints and a recognition that the mutual   demonization that hasoccoured in the past is completely counterproductive. Talk to you soon.\n"

Can we put the question differently:   what are the barriers to their concurrence and what can we do together to address those barriers?   If the barriers for EEI are insurmountable because of the recalcitrance of a few members, can they facilitate a dialogue between us and a more progressive group?\tJames D Steffes\t111/01/2000 05:25 PM \t\t\t To: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: EEI/ Enron consensus- building processSounds positive.

My discussions with others indicated that both (a) a curve validation process and (b) a deal-by-deal review would be undertaken.   The deal-by-deal review is especially critical during the implementation of a structured curve validation process.   In addition, even when the curve validation process is fully up and running, we should continue looking at major position impacts in new transactions.   There are many curves to review.   It seems reasonable to look at the critical rate curves as appropriate.Let me know.Jim SteffesScott Gahn04/15/2000 07:25 AMTo: John Neslage/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: David Gorte@ECT, Rick Buy@ECT, Scott Gahn@EES, Jeremy Blachman@EES, Scott Stoness@EES, Karen L Barbour@ECT, Steven J Kean@EES, James D Steffes@EES, Harry Kingerski@EES, Gia Maisashvili/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Re: EES - RAC Deal Approval Meeting   In the interest of clarity:   It was agreed that ongoing curve validation consistent with that followed on wholesale curves would be instituted.

List of each position by utility and by rate class within the deal 2. Regulated Rate forecasts by utility and by rate class for each position in the deal.   Not just the \"scalars\" but also the absolute $/Mwh.3. For each impacted position, the key assumptions contained within the curves -   a. deregulation date (if any) b. stranded cost roll-off date (if any) c. standard offer end date (if any) d. other rate reduction dates and amounts (if any)4. Revenue side or Cost side contract terms that impact the deal (for example, movement in pricing terms given some event)I also think that we should have at least 3 working days to review this package.   If anyone can think of anything else that would ease our analysis, I would be game.Thanks.JDS\n"

What we specifically discussed, and what scott s. left prepared and committed to do, involved looking at individual curves, the assumptions underlying them and some process (yet to be specifically determined) for addressing updates.   We agreed to start with the top 20 curves and especially those which are involved in the upcoming deals.I think the confusion is in what the term validation means.   In the ENA context it means one thing; in this context it means what we discussed (which was in Jim's memo and, as you'll recall, we went through point-by-point).   Let's just get this done.---"

The challenge as I understand it is that we have difficulty in quantifying the benefit and effectiveness of our ads.   We can measure on a periodic basis what the CEO/CCCO/CFO perception of Enron is on a periodic basis but this does not break down the impact of our PR efforts from an ad campaign.   I understand this dilemma.But one thing that we could measure that is quite important to me is what our employees think about these ads.   If all else fails these ads should make our employees proud to work for Enron - and this is something we should be able to measure on a consistent basis.I know you have an upcoming event in California where your organisation will talk about problems and challenges we have - so if you could consider this idea I would be very appreciative.   And of course don't get to hooked on God's country while you are in Napa.Thanks!John\n"

Phillips and Laura HeinauerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal03/07/20001The Wall Street JournalA2(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)WASHINGTON --- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.\"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,\" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 1000,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. \"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of this,\" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government relations. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 19997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. \"We'll be circulating them very broadly,\" Mr. Rice said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $5000,000 --- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials --- those of a libertarian persuasion --- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. \"That makes it a much more serious issue,\" Mr. Rice said. \"We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.\" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. \"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,\" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate BeneficiariesTop 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance forfiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millionsBoeing $3,3335Bechtel Group $1,075Distributed Processing Systems $3888Willbros Group $387United Technologies $3334Raytheon $156General Electric $150Halliburton $136Enron $135LSI Logic $120Source: Ex-Im BankCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Two other towers also are underway. In 1999, Hines began building a 1.2 million square-foot tower for Enron Corp. and late last year Crescent Real Estate Equities broke ground on a 27-story tower that will be anchored by Ernst &amp; Young. These three projects are the first major downtown office projects to get underway since 1986.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish ReformsBy Germana CanziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES03/07/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 1000,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 20001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 20001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +444 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Deal with state could take until 20002 to closeBy LESLIE GORNSTEINAP Business Writer03/06/20001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 20001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 20002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&amp;E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&amp;E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, \"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later.\" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&amp;E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. \"Trust me,\" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. \"There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare.\" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&amp;E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&amp;E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report03/06/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun reported Tuesday. The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report.A $3111 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. \"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,\" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently. Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and South, respectively. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 07/03/01 01-04GCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not FinalBy Jason Leopold03/06/20001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES --- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. \"This is not a done deal,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday --- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) --- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $4000 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. \"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,8000 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&amp;E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. --- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas03/06/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders said. Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.Some storage buying occurred in Texas \"if they could make it work,\" a trader said. \"It was a pretty uneventful day,\" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$333 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&amp;E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather. Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a range of $5.25-$5.30/MMMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar range of $5.26-$5.35/MMMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMMBtu. -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Phillips and Laura HeinauerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal03/07/20001The Wall Street JournalA2(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)WASHINGTON --- Angry and confused that a Republican administration has targeted one of their favorite programs for big cuts, America's largest exporters are appealing for help from lawmakers. Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Enron Corp., Halliburton Co. and others are launching an aggressive lobbying campaign on Capitol Hill to protect the Export-Import Bank from budget reductions; the White House labels the Ex-Im Bank as corporate welfare.\"The administration has fired its shot, and now we're firing ours,\" said Edmund B. Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 1000,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. \"Companies large and small who have similar interests here are banding together to provide an educational effort so people understand the impact of this,\" said Chris Hansen, Boeing senior vice president for government relations. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 19997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. \"We'll be circulating them very broadly,\" Mr. Rice said. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. At first, business lobbyists assumed administration budgeteers were just looking for savings anywhere they could find it. Before President Bush released his spending plan last week, companies appealed to Mitchell Daniels, head of the White House budget office, in an attempt to keep the Ex-Im Bank cuts out of the final proposal. The Ex-Im Bank's corporate clients include some of the country's largest political contributors. Boeing, the bank's largest user, received $3.3 billion of financing last year. The Seattle aerospace company and its employees contributed $1.8 million to politicians and parties during the 2000 election cycle, 61% to Republicans, according to federal election data assembled by the Center for Responsive Politics. Caterpillar, a Peoria, Ill., maker of engines and heavy equipment that secured seven Ex-Im Bank deals last year, and its employees contributed more than $5000,000 --- 96% to Republicans. Company officials deny they wanted to leverage donations to try to secure political support for the Ex-Im Bank. Many lobbyists have come to the conclusion that administration officials --- those of a libertarian persuasion --- oppose Ex-Im Bank as a form of welfare for corporations. Indeed, the White House budget plan criticized the bank's operations as unjustified public subsidies for companies. \"That makes it a much more serious issue,\" Mr. Rice said. \"We're concerned that the administration seems to be turning its attention in this direction.\" Barring intervention from Mr. Cheney, business groups now have largely given up hope of convincing the White House to back down, planning instead to use their muscle to convince Congress to restore the Ex-Im Bank's funding. Bank officials and U.S. companies argue that, far from being a subsidy, the bank simply allows American companies to compete with European and Japanese firms that receive assistance from their own governments. \"In many markets in Asia and Africa, the bank is absolutely critical to our ability to sell American-made products,\" said Bill Lane, Caterpillar's Washington director for governmental affairs. --- Corporate BeneficiariesTop 10 recipients of Ex-Im Bank loans, guarantees and insurance forfiscal year 2000, as measured by amount of financing, in millionsBoeing $3,3335Bechtel Group $1,075Distributed Processing Systems $3888Willbros Group $387United Technologies $3334Raytheon $156General Electric $150Halliburton $136Enron $135LSI Logic $120Source: Ex-Im BankCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

In another sign of the strength of the city's energy sector, Century is finalizing a headquarters deal with Reliant Resources Inc. to take more than two-thirds of the project's 850,000 square feet, says Edwin Murphy, a Century senior vice president. Two other towers also are underway. In 1999, Hines began building a 1.2 million square-foot tower for Enron Corp. and late last year Crescent Real Estate Equities broke ground on a 27-story tower that will be anchored by Ernst &amp; Young. These three projects are the first major downtown office projects to get underway since 1986. The surge is part of a renaissance of downtown Houston, where new sports facilities, hotels, apartment buildings and restaurants have been mushrooming in recent years. \"The new amenities have kept people from leaving and enticed people to come back,\" says Michael Hassler, of CB Richard Ellis.

Dutch Gas Competition Grows Despite Sluggish ReformsBy Germana CanziOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES03/07/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The Netherlands is emerging as an important testing ground for E.U. gas liberalization, as new trading hubs for competitive, short-term gas supplies from the U.K. and Norway emerge on the Belgian and German borders. However, much remains to be done. A group of large energy users and traders is preparing to confront Gasunie Thursday in a hearing organized by the regulator. The main issues of contention are the balancing system, which Gasunie conducts on an hourly basis, the extent to which transport tariffs are cost-focused and third-party access to storage facilities.The emergence of competition in the Dutch gas sector is mostly due to the initiative of new market entrants who, despite a difficult regulatory environment, have managed to develop a market for short-term gas virtually from scratch. If liquidity improves in these emerging hubs, the Netherlands could become an important transit country for freely tradeable gas supplies to other countries in northwest Europe, as well as being an important market in its own right. However, the difficulty of implementing transparent third-party access systems in the Netherlands and in neighboring Germany casts a dark cloud over recent progress in competition. Since December, Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), E.On AG (EON), RWE AG (G.RWE) and Electrabel SA (B.ELE) have been actively buying and selling gas, sourced in the U.K., the Netherlands and Norway, in a number of hubs between Emden in Germany and Emshaven and Oude Statenzijl in the Netherlands. David Gallagher, head of European gas trading at Enron in London, estimates that at least one trade a day of around 1000,000 therms for a quarterly contract is done at the Oude Statenzijl hub, where the Gasunie pipeline system connects to the network of Wingas GmbH. An important element kick-starting short-term trading was the sale, in December 2000, of a 2 billion cubic meter a year Norwegian gas supply contract to five Dutch-based power generators. Robert van der Hoeven, head of fuel procurement at Electrabel, the owner of Dutch generator EPON, said his company uses most of the gas it imports from Norway for its plants in the Netherlands and trades the rest on a short-term basis in the Oude-Emden area. This pattern is common to the other Dutch-based parties to that contract. Trading in Dutch hubs received a further boost when Nederlandse Gasunie NV (N.NEG) decided, after months of wrangling with regulator DTe, to lower its transport tariffs by 6.5% from January 20001 and to unbundle its combined commodity and service tariff, the so-called CSS system, from July 20001. Gasunie now claims its pipeline system is fully open and transparent. To prove this, it says it has lost 30% of its customers in the eligible market, but that figure hasn't changed much since March 2000. Small wonder that critics say the switching figure doesn't necessarily indicate an ideal system of third-party access. According to energy consultants The Brattle Group, around half of the gas used by alternative suppliers goes through the 1 bcm/year Zebra pipeline from Zelzate to Zeeland, which was built by Dutch utilities a few years ago precisely because Gasunie refused to provide access on favorable terms. Shippers have complained that the hourly system used by Gasunie to balance the pipeline system raises the overall cost of shipping through its network significantly. Gasunie imposes a balancing charge which effectively forces shippers to pay for the extra gas brought into the system from storage sites, in addition to the capacity and transmission price. Critics say Gasunie has so far failed to unbundle these charges, although it agreed to do so in January. According to the Brattle Group, another controversial aspect of Gasunie's tariff system is that it is based on theoretical costs of constructing new pipelines rather than its actual costs. The DTe is also considering ways of reforming the storage system to make it competitive. BP PLC (U.BP) and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij NV operate storage facilities and lease capacity to Gasunie through long-term contracts. The regulator is studying ways of allowing third parties access to storage facilities. Gasunie has so far shown little sign of negotiating more competitive tariffs with storage operators and passing on the benefits to customers, critics say. The growth of short-term trading in the Dutch gas market is also inevitably linked to its potential as a transit country for gas coming from the U.K.-Belgium gas interconnector and going towards the 82bcm-a-year German market. Market participants say liquidity at the Emden and Oude hubs has grown considerably since E.On and RWE started trading there earlier this year. However, the obstructive attitude of incumbents toward third-party access there has meant that so far most gas traded in the Netherlands has remained there. -By Germana Canzi, Dow Jones Newswires; +444 20 7842 9283; germana.canzi@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Rice, president of the Coalition for Employment Through Exports, an industry group that is leading the effort. Since they got wind of the proposed cuts a few weeks ago, business lobbyists have been trying to rally sympathetic lawmakers. And executives at Boeing, Caterpillar and other big companies plan to contact some 1000,000 smaller suppliers that benefit indirectly from the $12.6 billion of export loans, guarantees and insurance that Ex-Im Bank provided in the last fiscal year. Those small companies, the executives hope, will create a groundswell of support in Congress for the Ex-Im Bank. Corporate lobbyists also have dug up a speech that Vice President Dick Cheney, while chief executive of Halliburton, gave in 19997 praising the bank and scoffing at those who consider it a giveaway to big business. They plan to pass Mr. Cheney's comments to influential members of Congress this week. A spokeswoman for Mr. Cheney had no immediate comment. Ex-Im Bank officials aren't talking publicly, avoiding the appearance that they are battling the White House to overturn the proposed 25% cut in the bank's $865 million operating budget for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. But an Ex-Im official said the topic has come up in conversations between key lawmakers and Ex-Im Bank Chairman James A. Harmon, who is soon to be succeeded by Mel Sembler, a Bush campaign fund-raiser and a shopping-center developer. Copyright &amp;copy; 20001 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Deal with state could take until 20002 to closeBy LESLIE GORNSTEINAP Business Writer03/06/20001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 20001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.LOS ANGELES (AP) - A tentative deal aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from insolvency might not close in time to prevent the utility from begging creditors for more patience, Edison officials said Tuesday. The utility's tentative, $2.7 billion agreement to sell its power lines to the state could take until 20002 to be consummated, thanks to complicated legal issues and other paperwork, an Edison official told bondholders Tuesday.Once the deal is signed, Edison will try to borrow against the promised cash, but Edison International Chief Financial Officer Ted Craver admitted the utility might have to ask creditors to simply wait for their money until it has the $2.7 billion in hand. Energy suppliers owed money by Edison did not immediately return calls for comment Tuesday. At least four groups of suppliers have sued Edison for millions in unpaid bills going back months. Edison and fellow utility Pacific Gas &amp; Electric have said they have lost $13 billion on the open power market thanks to soaring prices paired with state-imposed price caps. PG&amp;E's parent company was able to recently borrow $1 billion to pay its stockholders and its debuts. It did not use any of that money to pay PG&amp;E's bills. Edison's disclosure, meanwhile, shocked state officials. Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, initially declined to comment on the status of the Edison deal, but eventually said, regarding its closure, \"We're optimistic it will be sooner rather than later.\" The pacing would have nothing to do with whether fellow utilities Sempra Energy and PG&amp;E also sell their transmission lines to California, Craver said. Among the things that could delay the deal's closing is Edison's need to find landowners on whose property its lines were built to assure no legal agreements are being violated by the sale. Edison would also have to pin down exactly what it would be selling to the state - terms that might not be decided until after a deal has been inked, Craver said. \"Trust me,\" Craver said in a phone call after the conference. \"There are a lot of legal-type documents - stuff that you and I ... would think of as a bloody nightmare.\" The disclosure comes at a time when an increasing number of power suppliers are suing the utility for millions in unpaid bills. Edison also disclosed Tuesday that two more lawsuits had landed in its lap - one by a group of wind-powered generators including Enron Wind, the other by two suppliers including New York-based Caithness Energy. Both suits were filed during the past five days, Edison Assistant General Counsel Barbara Reeves said. It was not immediately clear how much the complainants were seeking; neither Enron nor Caithness returned calls for comment. The two filings bring the total number of suits by renewable-energy suppliers against Edison to four, the utility said. The city of Long Beach and CalEnergy Operating Group, a geothermal supplier, have also sued for back payments. CalEnergy alone has said it is owed $45 million in November and December payments. The line sale, part of a multifaceted, tentative deal with the state that could save Edison from insolvency, could take anywhere from several months into next year, Craver said. The tentative deal, announced by Gov. Gray Davis Feb. 23, calls for the state to pay more than twice the book value for Edison's lines. It also would require Edison to sell cheap power to the state for a decade and for Edison to end its lawsuit against state regulators. The suit asserts that price caps imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission are illegal under federal law. Additionally, Edison's parent would have to return $420 million it collected from the utility over the past several years. The money was used to pay debt, buy back stock and pay dividends to investors. SCE, PG&amp;E and Sempra have complained they are near bankruptcy because of soaring prices on the open market combined with the state-imposed price caps for consumers. Sempra and PG&amp;E have yet to announce similar line-sale deals with the state, though they and the governor have said negotiations are ongoing. The total cost of the 26,000 miles of lines has been estimated at $4.5 billion to $7 billion.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Sierra Pacific CEO Doubts SEC OK Of Enron Unit Buy-Report03/06/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Sierra Pacific Resources (SRP) CEO Walter Higgins said in an interview last week that he doubts the company's $3.1 billion acquisition of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) utility Portland General Electric will be approved by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the Las Vegas Sun reported Tuesday. The SEC must find that Sierra Pacific is in a strong financial position before it will approve the deal, but the company is currently weakened by having lost millions of dollars in fuel and purchased power costs, Higgins said in the report.A $3111 million rate increase to cover those costs began March 1, but Higgins said that money would only pay back those expenses and wouldn't improve the company's stability to a level the SEC would find adequate, according to the report. The Public Utilities Commission can halt the rate hike and order refunds if it decides the hike isn't necessary. The PUC is holding hearings to determine the prudency of the hike, and members of the state's powerful casino and mining industries have filed to intervene. Sierra Pacific's plan to shore up its financial position through the sale of its 10 power plants, worth nearly $2 billion, may also be in jeopardy. The state Senate is considering a bill to block the sales, and Nevada Gov. Kenny Guinn recently sent a letter to the PUC asking that it reconsider its order allowing electric utilities to sell assets. Financial analysts have said that not allowing Sierra Pacific's two utilities to sell their assets would have a ripple effect on the company's financial position. The asset sales are tied to low-priced power contracts, and if the sales are canceled, the low-priced power will be gone as well. \"If the divestiture is stopped...the state may be dealing with a much bigger rate increase,\" Steve Fleishman, Merrill Lynch utility analyst, told Dow Jones Newswires recently. Sierra Pacific is the parent company of electric utilities Sierra Pacific Power Co. and Nevada Power, which serve customers in the state's North and South, respectively. -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872, jessica.berthold@dowjones.com -0- 07/03/01 01-04GCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Many Power Deals Announced by California Governor Still Not FinalBy Jason Leopold03/06/20001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)Dow Jones Newswires LOS ANGELES --- Many of the long-term power-supply contracts announced by California Gov. Gray Davis this week remain under negotiation or are the subject of ongoing lawsuits, power suppliers said Tuesday.The lack of finality to the deals raises questions about the state's success in covering its power needs, particularly going into what is expected to be an unusually tight summer. Generators said privately they were surprised the governor went ahead with his announcement Monday, given that many of the contracts haven't been signed. David Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, who negotiated the contracts on behalf of the state, conceded that details remain to be worked out. \"This is not a done deal,\" Mr. Freeman said, adding that credit concerns are keeping generators from signing the deals. Gov. Davis announced Monday that California has secured 40 long-term contracts that will provide California with about 629 million megawatt hours of electricity over 10 years, at a price of more than $40 billion. A megawatt hour is roughly the amount of electricity needed to power 1,000 homes. Several of those forward deals, however, involve contracts originally held by Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp; Electric at the California Power Exchange, previously the state's main power market. The governor seized those contracts earlier this year, just before the Power Exchange liquidated them to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in power bills the utilities had failed to pay. The contracts, which total about 1.3 million megawatt hours of electricity and have a market value of about $1 billion, according to market sources, have yet to be paid for or signed over to the state. Duke Energy Corp. (DUK), one of the suppliers that sold the contracts to Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, has sued Gov. Davis for unlawfully commandeering those contracts. Although Duke has reached an interim settlement to continue providing power to the state Department of Water Resources until April 30, the company and the Davis administration still have to \"develop a comprehensive long-term settlement to pay for the power supply contracts,\" said Duke spokesman Tom Williams. The governor went ahead with the announcement, because the California Department of Water Resources believes it will be able to finalize and sign the contracts over the next several weeks, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Separately, several suppliers named in the governor's announcement Monday --- including Duke, Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Sempra Energy, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Avista Corp. (AVA) --- said they have yet to sign final agreements with the state, although negotiations were ongoing. \"We are working in good faith with the DWR toward a long-term contract,\" said Art Larson, spokesman for Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra. Mr. Larson said Sempra signed a terms of agreement with the water-resources department and expects to reach a final agreement over the next several weeks. Reliant said it has only signed a short-term contract with the state that expires in about two weeks. The company will only sign a long-term contract once it's paid more than $4000 million owed by Pacific Gas and SoCal Ed, spokesman Richard Wheatley said. Mirant said it also won't sign contracts with the state until it's paid. Enron said it's reached agreement on terms with the state, but has some credit-related details to hammer out. \"Everything's been agreed to except for some credit technicalities,\" Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said. Meanwhile, small, independent power plants in California that are capable of generating 1,8000 megawatts of power are shut down because their owners haven't been paid by the state's two main utilities, the California Independent System Operator said Tuesday. The decline in small-plant output has contributed to the state's power-supply problems the past two months. Partnerships involving El Paso Corp. (EPG), for example, shut down 350 megawatts of generation last weekend due to nonpayment, the company said Tuesday. SoCal Ed hasn't paid the owners of the smaller generators, known as \"qualifying facilities,\" since early December, which means the generators are still owed for electric production in October, while PG&amp;E has paid only a small percentage of its qualifying facility bills since its last full payment in early January. The plants, one-third of which are powered by renewable sources like wind and solar power, meet almost 30% of California's electricity needs. Almost all of the closed generators are fueled by natural gas, and many haven't been able to pay their gas suppliers and have been cut off from their gas supply. The California Senate Energy Committee plans to vote on legislation to create a new pricing system for all qualifying facilities this week. The proposed bill would cut the prices to qualifying facilities from about 17 cents a kilowatt-hour the past eight months to about eight cents, depending on the price of five-year natural-gas contracts the generators can sign. The plants that run on renewable resources would be paid 5.4 cents a kilowatt-hour. --- Mark Golden contributed to this article.

US Natural Gas Prices Fall As Demand Slips In Most Areas03/06/20001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 20001, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Tuesday as demand eased, except in the Northeast and Southeast areas of the country, traders said. Heavy snowstorms in the upper Northeast supported some pricing, as did cooler weather in Georgia, the Carolinas and the Florida panhandle.Some storage buying occurred in Texas \"if they could make it work,\" a trader said. \"It was a pretty uneventful day,\" a Gulf Coast trader said late Tuesday. Also, because of the snowstorm in the Northeast, traders had purchased gas ahead of time to make up for needed load, he said. A scheduled work outage on Enron's Transwestern San Juan lateral in New Mexico was completed, and the return of a power plant in California alleviated demand in the West, traders said. At the Arizona-California border hub, buyers paid around $13-$333 a million British thermal units, West Coast traders said, down as much as $15 from Monday. At PG&amp;E Citygate, prices were mixed, with buyers paying $9.75-$10.65/MMMBtu, down 25 cents on the bid, up 15 cents on the offer. In the Midwest, Chicago Citygate prices fell 7 cents-8 cents to a range of $5.42-$5.53/MMMBtu. Alliance Pipeline into Chicago traded around $5.47-$5.52/MMMBtu, down 4 cents to 9 cents from Monday. The Nymex April natural gas futures contract settled at $5.315/MMMBtu, down 2.1 cents in a tight, range-bound, uneventful session that started late due to bad weather. Physical gas prices at the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana ended in a range of $5.25-$5.30/MMMBtu, down 2 cents-6 cents from Monday. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line at Station 65 deals were made in a similar range of $5.26-$5.35/MMMBtu, down 2 cents on the bid, unchanged on the offer. At Katy in East Texas, buyers paid $5.21-$5.30/MMMBtu, down 5 cents-6 cents. At Waha, prices fell 9 cents-12 cents to a range of $5.15-$5.30/MMMBtu. -By John Edmiston, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9209; john.edmiston@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

      "body": "\nI need you to run these items by Rick.   I take full responsibility for approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services for something other than WTO.   In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be better spent on other activities.   My inclination is to do the bare minimum necessary to keep the machine going.   If we have specifically committed to certain things, then let's follow through.   If there are things we can avoid, let's avoid them.   Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.   With respect to the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific strategies we are now working out for the regions?   These are the kinds of things we need to consider.Joe Hillings@ENRON04/19/2000 04:13 AMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EEScc:   Subject: Enron and the Energy Services Issue Before The WTOSteve: This is a brief extension of our conversation yesterday afternoon putting in print some of the upcoming dates and possible committments for your consideration and decision.We have no exit strategy at this time and in order to follow your general instructions to withdraw gradually (I'm not quite certain that is possible at this stage) you need to know the following.The April meeting at the WTO in Geneva (Committee on Specific Committments) spent considerable time discussing how energy services would be considered in the WTO GATS (General Agreement on Trade and Services) . The USTR raised the issue, tabled the issue and guided the discussion. We did not send anyone to that session.As planned for several months, we issued the Rachel Thompson study which is completing its basic distribution now. There has already been considerable interest in the study and I fully expect it to generate discussion in the days ahead. I have sent you the correspondence from the Japanese Ministry. Tonight I am hosting a small dinner for the top staff person for the leading Japanese business organization affiliated with the CSI organization. He raised the issue of Japan's industry feeling energy services was going too fast too soon when Ken addressed the WTO Ministerial Forum last December in Seattle. Now he has told Bob Vastine, president of CSI that he was told later by his collegues that his statement was a misstatement. We'll hear more tonight.Later today, the ESC Executive Committee is meeting with the DOE to discuss how they can support energy services for the USTR who has lacked technical advisers since Donna Bobbich and Russ Profozich left DOE earlier this year. DOE has appointed a group to help USTR and this is an orientation meeting held at their request.Next week I have scheduled the first ESC full meeting since January to update members (now 50 since Schlumberger joined on Friday) on developments which is essentially a report by USTR Carol Balassa who is the responsible official handling energy services.She has given a couple of us a debriefing on what happened at the WTO meeting and a request to prepare more detailed information for the May 10 meeting in Geneva where she tells us that energy services will be even more involved in the discussion. We should have Bob Fisher go to that meeting to be of assistance. This is a decision point for you.We have made some other committments which are also decision points although the Helsinki meeting on June 18th has been agreed upon based on my feelings that when I discussed it (the SCO/FSN Showcase Europe) in Houston with you and Rick, you raised no objection which I took as agreeing that it should go forward.   We have done this meeting annually where I have brought in someone from Enron companies to brief them and host them for dinner. These are the commercial people in the US embassies throughout Europe and the former Soviet Union. They are important points of contact for our commercial people.   This year they want to have energy services in the WTO and as we would like them to exist in their territory. A few members of the ESC Executive Committee will do the former and Peter Styles the later. I have organized the dinner.Following that meeting is one that EC Trade staffer Uta Klinkers wants the ESC Executive Committee to put on in Brussels which is a joint meeting she is organizing with European energy industry representatives. This is a dialogue on energy services. The EU is an important player in the WTO and Uta, who recently met with the ESC Executive Committee in Washington is quite supportive of liberalized energy services. At the EC she reports directly to Commissioner Pascal Lamy. Rick's memo this week suggested we have Peter Styles do this briefing. Peter is not an American and is not affiliated with the ESC. Therefore, unless we participate, Europe's energy industry is not talking with US industry. If this is what you want, then I should tell Uta that we are unable to do the meeting.The last meeting is the presentation by Ken Lay at the OECD Forum 2000 on June 26 which I engineered with Doug Worth, Secretary General of the BIAC (Business Industry Affairs Committee) to the OECD. This is a major world conference and Ken is addressing e-commerce and services. Doug, an American and former head of the Washington IBM office wants to have Ken meet with OECD Commissioners in a smaller meeting to discuss trends for the future.   I had planned to be there with Ken for the day, day and a half he will be in Paris. I introduced our company to the OECD several years ago and it has become increasingly involved in issues of interest to us.Well, these are the near-term items that require your fine hand if we are to proceed. A dramatic drop off at this time will have its effects and no one is likely to pick up our leadership. There is growing support for what has been accomplished and the USG plus others are now hooked on the energy services agenda. I cannot easily see an exit strategy that can do anything but cause criticism at this point. This is definately a longer term committment that I thought we had made when approval was given to hire the Hills firm. However, if you want to exit, other than pulling back from the Brussels meeting, I think the other meetings are firm committements at this point.These are some thoughts for your consideration and decision.Joe\n"

Confidentially, this is a case of a developer overselling use of the Enron name for approximately $5 million equity stake.   We have caught him in many half truths and are uncomfortable going too far with this since we might get be placed in an awkward position.   Because of EOL and our own concerns, we intentionally toned it down.   I believe, in fact, that it is just another platform as well as an investment.   Consequently, we would prefer to keep this to the minimum of allowing them to issue a press release as included in the contract.   Your concurrence would be appreciated.

My take, after discussions with Terry, was that she was brought on to handle the environmental side of sustainable development, but that Palmisano was utilizing her for greenhouse gas related issues since not much had occurred on the other front yet.   Burt Mike and I learned last week that she actually reports to Palmisano---he is the one who took her from consultant to employee status.   I spoke with John on Friday and told him that I wasn't going to poach her now that I knew where she fit in the scheme of things.   This actually solves a dilemma for me anyway.   As you know, I need a more senior environmental person with good high level relationships with NGOs and I didn't want her to feel slighted when I found someone.   Moreover, she has just advised us that she and her husband are moving to San Francisco and wants to telecommute.   This should work fine for John but I feel it is important for my person to be in DC or NY.

This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social issues, from non-governmental organizations and potentially other businesses, to advise us on trends and issues in this area.   An outline of the advisory council structure, along with categories of experts and proposed names is attached below.We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year, inviting the Enron executive committee and board of directors, as well as the Corporate Responsibility task force, to engage in a dialogue.   We plan to present a slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month, and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16.Thanks for your consideration.\n"

Here are some more thoughts:FERC should take a hard look at why the ISO is almost always in an \"inc\" situation in real time.   Without structural incentives to go short into real time, I would expect the CAISO to \"inc\" in some hours and \"dec\" in others --- with no consistent patterns.The IOU's have four choices for purchasing power:   PX Block Forward, PX Day Ahead, PX Day Of, and CAISO Ex Post.   They had ample opportunity to purchase lower cost power in the PX Block Forward but didn't buy enough.   That left them short in the Day Ahead.   They can reduce Day Ahead prices by moving some of their load to the Ex Post market.   Dave Parquet did an Econ 101 presentation on this incentive at the CAISO board meeting in June.The ISO remains primarily in \"inc\" mode even during the shoulder months when prices are lower, another indicator that the real time \"inc\" problem is driven by the load side rather than the supply side.   The IOU's continue to go short into the ISO Ex Post market even when the CAISO Ex Post price is consistently above the PX Day Ahead price.There is evidence that the IOU's are not willing to pay above the CAISO price cap for energy from the PX in the Day Ahead market.   Does it matter that the price cap for the ISO also acts as a PX price cap?The NOx market in California is very tight.   How has this contributed to higher costs and has the complete lack of available NOx credits prevented any generators from running?How large was the impact of the below normal water year on the supply side?   The attached presentation quantifies this effect in the Northwest.   (I have a theory on how hydro capacity completely overstates reserve margins in the west from an economic perspective.   I can go into more detail if you wish.)Friction between California PX and ISO markets and other western markets.   For example, why are actual flows going into the state yet prices out side of the state are higher?   Another example of anomylous behavior is at COB on 8/111 and 8/12.   There was congestion from California TO the northwest those days in the Day Ahead market.   In real time the NW ended up being a net seller of about 3,000 MW from the NW TO California.Demand Side - we really need to press on this issue because all of the proponents of price caps claim that as soon as the demand side is \"workably competitive\" then there is no need for price caps.   Is large-scale economic demand response required for a competitive market?   What if demand response is there, but at very high prices?   The demand response in California is a joke.   With 27000 MW of interuptible, why did the utilities and the CAISO only get around 6000 MW of economic demand response.   Much of this response comes at $15000/MWh.   The assymetric treatment of supply side resources and demand side resources can be justified on environmental grounds, but not economic grounds.   So why this assymetric treatment?   This gets to the question of the fine line between \"scarcity rents\" which are ok, and market power which is not.   If power is scarce, and demand truly values it at $15000/MWh then shouldn't that be the price.   At what price would the rest of the interuptible load economically curtail?   Bottom line --- there are about 2,000 MW of load that should be able to respond to price signals that chooses not to or values power at more than $15000/MWh.Burden of proof --- what empirical measures should be used to assess market power?   The reports published to date have been unimpressive.   The Market Analysis Unit report, for example, does a bunch of handwaving and then concludes that there is market power.   But they never explain why.   I would think that proof might be something like this:   Generator X sets price y% of the time when loads exceed Z MWs.   Or, four generators set price 80% of the time when prices exceed $2000/MWh.   They have all the data to be able to tell, yet they don't provide any empirical measures.   The only test I've heard of so far is the UC Energy Institute report that demonstrates that generators are submitting bids above their marginal cost.   The PX report states that supply bids are fewer and at higher prices than last year.   They fail to mention the fact that there are 5,000 fewer MW of hydro this year relative to last.James D Steffes@EES08/17/2000 06:18 AMTo: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EEES@EES, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/SFO/EEES@EES, Mona L Petrochko/SFO/EEES@EES, Bruno Gaillard/SFO/EEES@EES, Sarah Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES, Richard Shapiro/HOU/EEES@EES Subject: FERC INVESTIGATION IN CA - What should they be looking for?As we begin to meet with FERC Staff on the Wholesale market issues related to CA problems, I think that we need to put together a list of questions that FERC needs to be asking Western power market participants.

Non-affiliated competitors continue to build straw men and describe abuses with no real evidence to back them up (the funny money argument and capacity hoarding are two examples.   The funny money argument assumes marketing affiliates will bid above market rates for capacity because they excess payment is going to the corporate bottom line.   Hoarding capacity to drive up price   may be an issue, but it is not a marketing affiliate issue, as anyone can do it). FERC staff did not seem terribly sympathetic to the points made, but at least one FERC staffer seemed to believe that one solution would be to require the pipelines to offer capacity in smaller blocks to let smaller entities put together bids.   FERC also indicated they were in fact auditing compliance, but in a non-public way.There were some concerns voiced which I agree with and there is an opportunity to file additional comments on Apr. 30.   I would like to put the following in these comments:Evidence of affiliate abuse/preference is just not there.   The best folks can do is make up stuff.We welcome FERC monitoring if that is needed to bring confidence to the marketplace that abuse is not occurring.   But the issue is really whether we do have a crisis of confidence or merely a bunch of disgruntled competitors who are just seeking to neutralize the affiliated competitors).The FERC rules and the information reported (with a caveat) under those rules are adequate for detection and enforcement and deterrence.That said, the definition of marketing affiliate should be expanded to include affiliated electric generators, who are siting plants along affiliate pipelines.The pipeline 637 reporting and internet systems should allow users to download and manipulate transportation related data, which is not currently the case.We also need to address a deal on Northern where ENA took capacity at a discount, albeit after other parties had an opportunity to match our bid.   This was a deal brought up in the conference.Let me know how this sounds. Thanks.\n"

For the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this group that would let them access only those data elements needed.I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting your approval as well.   These people have basically been prevented from being able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc.   for the past week.Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional information.Thanks.Jo Ann ---Original Message---From:   Taylor, Deana   Sent: Friday, July 13, 20001 4:37 PMTo: Hill, Jo AnnCc: Choyce, Karen; Lindsey, Mark E.Subject: Request for PR2 AccessJo Ann,As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR2 Enterprise access re-activated for the following employees:   Karen Choyce   HR View Basic Data &amp; Org ENTP   Deana Taylor   HR View Basic Data &amp; Org ENTP   Joanne Cortez   HR View Basic Data &amp; Org ENTP   (starting in the group 7/16)   Rebecca Tran   HR View Basic Data &amp; Org ENTP   &amp;   View Payroll and Time   Roy Comeaux   HR View Basic Data &amp; Org ENTP   &amp;   View Payroll and Time   George Howell   HR View Basic Data &amp; Org ENTP   &amp;   View Payroll and Time   Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department,   the list of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed this type of access. Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed.The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job.   Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc,   through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly.   Equally as important,   the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger).   Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC.   I hope this \"pleads our case\" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.   Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey, if you need additional information. Thanks,Deana3-4593\n"

There is not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and power lines --- its largely a state and local decision.   Further, the problem has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.   Once utilities are in the open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to connect to the grid.   The answer is open access, so power can get from where it is to where it is needed.   This has been clear for a long time, yet the current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their authority to make this happen.   The result: spiking prices and reliability problems.\t\"Hunt, Hunter L\" &lt;HLHunt@georgewbush.com&lt;\t09/27/2000 111:25 AM \t\t\t To: \"'skean@enron.com'\" &lt;skean@enron.com&lt;\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: FW: fact sheet- latest draft - FactSheet-LatestDraft-09272000.doc\n"

I stressed to him that it would be difficult to come into Enron to run a business, but he could build to it over time.   His main concern was that he not get \"lost in the system\" if he came in at a level below business unit head.I think Robert would be a good addition to Enron if 1) he is willing to come in to a commercial role at a more junior level to learn the system and 2) we can make sure that he gets the opportunity to have contact with senior levels of the organization from time to time.\tKayla Ruiz\t01/04/20001 09:08 AM \t\t\t To: Mark Frevert/NA/Enron@Enron, David W Delainey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: Nicki Daw/NA/Enron@Enron, Kay Chapman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron@Enron, Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t Subject: Feedback on Robert Mallett InterviewMr. Lay has requested feedback from your interview with Robert Mallett on December 20th.

As you'll recall these were:a) to get the BLM to withdraw any \"interim\" policies, the first of which split fiber cables into 1444 different ROW certifications, and a later version that re-packaged the issue, mandating that ROW certificates be issued each time a fiber owner subleases or sells capacity on its line, with a retroactivity clause that added extra sting;b) to get the Forest Service to retract its May 2nd memorandum which changed its fiber optic ROW policy from published fee schedules to individual \"comparable\" assessments (the first such assessment, which compared ROW fees in urban centers in downtown Portland and Seattle to Oregon forest lands, increased the cost of a segment of our FTV fiber build 150 fold);c) to block both agencies from implementing any proposed or final rule in FY 20001; andd) to create an open rule making process that involves all interested stakeholders, including Enron.Thanks to the considerable pressure we orchestrated from Congress and the Administration, BLM Director Fry and USFS Chief Dombeck have backed away from points a and b above, and have agreed to points c and d.   The language we inserted in the Interior Appropriations Bill, which has been agreed to by the Conferees, forces both agencies to revert back to the published fee schedules, prevents them from implementing any new policies in FY 20001, and forces them to work with industry and to come up with a common policy for future rent determination.The reference in the opening sentence to gravitationally-challenged women is because the issue still hasn't quite closed.   The Interior Appropriations Bill may very well be vetoed.   But since our issue was settled at the staff level, and is now off the table, we're likely to remain safe from being re-examined and challenged.   In fact, any changes would likely only increase the strength of our hand: some members of our coalition are trying to insert even more detailed language in the report that prescribes exactly how the agencies will proceed to determine the new rental fee schedules over the next 18 months.   Through outside consultants, we've had a series of constructive discussions with the agencies over the past two weeks that have forged agreements on timing and specific ways forward.   Details are forthcoming, but Enron would be involved closely in the process.   The agencies were clearly surprised by the clout we wielded, and are now more than willing to negotiate.But the bottom line, again, is that we have stopped both agencies from implementing their costly interim policies or launching a rule making process either now (which they originally intended to do) or in the coming fiscal year.   And by engaging key Members of Congress and the White House, and organizing and leading the 20-member   Fiber Optic Public Land Right-of-Way Coalition, we've succeeded in branding Enron as a leader in the communications field.

We have debated from time-to-time whether we would be better off with a pure \"loads pay\" transmission pricing scheme because it would leave fewer places for utilities to hide the ball (when they pay for transmission they are just transferring money from one pocket to the other) and it would allow us to reach the maximum number of counterparties for each MW (thereby increasing liquidity).

It will take place the 16th of January at the Commission's offices in Montreal.&lt;&lt; In August, I had the opportunity to visit the NACEC's Montreal headquarters to discuss a number of the key issues to be addressed by the electricity restructuring expert report and to get a better feel for the nature of the guidance and input the Advisory Board can contribute to this initiative.   More than ever, I am convinced that the outstanding group of individuals serving on the Advisory Board can play an important role in defining and deepening our understanding of the key trade and environment issues at play on a continental scale.&lt;&lt; The Secretariat has made considerable progress in conducting a thorough scoping analysis, compiling a searchable database of renewable energy definitions and portfolio standards and initiating work in the area of market access and trade disciplines.   At this early stage of development of the expert report, I believe it is an ideal time to schedule our first meeting of the Advisory Board to familiarize ourselves with major issues and provide advice on the scope and content of the report, as well as the broader initiative.&lt;&lt; The Secretariat has been in contact with you in advance to select a date for our first meeting so that the greatest number of Board members can participate. Accordingly, we will hold a one-day meeting in Montreal on Tuesday, the 16th of January 20001. The NACEC will cover all travel expenses along with accommodations and per diem. The Meeting Coordinator at the NACEC, Leticia Villeneuve, will be in touch to assist you in making your travel arrangements. If you wish you may contact her at 514-350-4313. Those Board members that cannot attend will be able to join portions of the meeting by conference call.&lt;&lt; I have included a draft agenda for your review along with the list of current members of the Advisory Board.   The Secretariat will soon establish a web site and list serve to facilitate our communications, including the exchange and review of documents. The Secretariat will also prepare, in advance of our first meeting, a brief but detailed report outline, including the major themes that are being considered for the report.   The Secretariat is seeking our views on the key issues that warrant special analysis.&lt;&lt; I very much look forward to meeting you soon in Montreal.   As always, feel free to contact me if you would like to talk over any aspect of our work together. Or, if you have any questions regarding the logistics of the meeting, please contact Alicia Chica at the Secretariat at 514-350-43330, or by e-mail at achica@ccemtl.org .&lt;&lt; Sincerely,&lt;&lt; Philip Sharp&lt; Chair&lt;   North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation Electricity Advisory Board&lt;&lt;   ---&lt;   Name: AGENDA.DOC&lt;   AGENDA.DOC   Type: Download File (application/msword)&lt;   Encoding: base64---***Christine ElwellSierra Club of CanadaSenior Policy Analyst517 College St. Suite #237Toronto, ON, Canada, M6G-4A2Phone#:416-5333-51777 Fax:416-960-00020E-mail: scenergy@web.net*** - program.doc\n"

Thank you for generously offering to help usexplore this connection.   We believe there are strong synergies between Professor Bill Moomaw'sInternational Environment and Resource Policy program and Enron's business model.   There iscurrently a strong recruiting relationship between Enron and Fletcher; there are nine Fletcheritesat Enron at this time.   I'm confident that our strong recruiting relationship is a solid first stepfrom which to launch an even stronger partnership.In order to explore expanding this relationship Ms. Elise Kalmans, Director of CommunityDevelopment, agreed to arrange a meeting for Bill and me last spring.   Unfortunately, the schedulingdid not work out, and Ms. Kalmans then began a maternity leave so we had trouble identifying a newpoint of contact.I appreciate your suggestion that we aim to work through Stephen Kean.   As Senior Vice President forPublic and Environmental and Government Affairs, he does sound like the ideal contact with whom todiscuss Professor Moomaw's program and its students. How do you suggest we proceed?   Should we senda letter from Interim Dean Trachtman to ask if Mr. Kean would be willing to meet with ProfessorMoomaw?   May I mention that you suggested we write him?At Betsy's suggestion, I have attached the presentation outline we prepared for Enron, along withthe letter we originally mailed to Elise.   I would be very interested in any suggestions you mayhave.   If you have any trouble opening the powerpoint file or word document, please let me know andI would be happy to mail or fax them.   Thank you again for your kind offer of assistance.Sincerely,Laura KarchAssociate Director, External RelationsFletcher School of Law and Diplomacy617-627-2720 - IERP enron.ppt - enron Kalmans.doc\n"

The school is also happy and wantsto strengthen its relationship with Enron.   They had earlier this year contacted a Laura Kalmans, Director of Community Development at Enron, to discuss various ideas for cooperation with Enron that would strengthen our capacity in environmental matters and give the studentsexposure to real world issues, but nothing happened and they lost contact.   They asked me who they should contact to find out how to pursue this and I said I thought it might be you or someone under you.   They now want to send a letterto someone at Enron on this proposal.   It is OK if it is addressed to you or should I tellthem another name?   Please advise me how to steer them in the right direction.   Many thanks.   David Merrill ---"

Am I understanding your position right? Is it going to be something like a 5 year contract? Will it help your business at all?2)California Power Exchange has decided to cease its operation by the end of April. Do you think this is the right decision? How do you think you can set up a new competitive market? Or, won't you need such a market? Will it be better to use the markets outside Califorinia or to rely on direct trading?3)How much supply do you have in excess from which you can offer power to California?***I understand you are very busy but I would really appreciate if you could send me a reply at your earliest convenience.Thank you very much.***Kiyoshi AndoNIKKEI NewsTEL 202-204-2104FAX 202-737-0170e-mail andou_wdc@nikkei.com815, Connecticut Ave. NW #310Washington DC 20006\n"

We knew this was coming!!!&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Bill 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent chargeon&lt; &lt; every&lt; &lt; delivered E-mail.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Please read the following carefully if you intend to stay online,   and&lt; &lt; continue using E-mail. The last few months have revealed an alarming&lt; &lt; trend in the Government of the United States attempting to quietly push&lt; &lt; through legislation that will effect our use of the Internet. Under&lt; proposed&lt; &lt; legislation, the US Postal Service will be attempting to bill E-mailusers&lt; &lt; out of \"alternative postage fees\". Bill 602P will permit the Federal&lt; &lt; Government&lt; &lt; to charge a 5-cent surcharge on every E-Mail delivered, by billing&lt; Internet&lt; &lt; Service Providers at source. The consumer would then be billed in turnby&lt; the&lt; &lt; ISP.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to preventthis&lt; &lt; legislation from becoming law. The US Postal Service is claiming lost&lt; &lt; revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail is costing nearly$230,000,000&lt; &lt; in revenue per year. You may have noticed their recent ad campaign:&lt; &lt; \"There is nothing like a letter.\" Since the average person receivedabout&lt; &lt; 10 pieces of E-mail per day in 19998, the cost of the typical individual&lt; would&lt; &lt; be an additional 50 cents a day - or over $180 per year - above andbeyond&lt; &lt; their regular Internet costs. Note that this would be money paiddirectly&lt; to&lt; &lt; the US Postal Service for a service they do not even provide. The whole&lt; point&lt; &lt; of the&lt; &lt; Internet is democracy and non-interference. You are already paying an&lt; &lt; exorbitant&lt; &lt; price for snail mail because of bureaucratic efficiency. It currently&lt; takes&lt; &lt; up to 6 days for a letter to be delivered from coast to coast. If the US&lt; &lt; Postal Service is allowed to tinker with E-mail it will mark the end of&lt; the&lt; &lt; \"free\" Internet in the United States. Our Congressional representative,&lt; Tony&lt; &lt; Schnell (R) has even suggested a \"$20-$40 per month surcharge on all&lt; Internet&lt; &lt; service\" above and beyond the governments proposed E-mail charges. Note&lt; that&lt; &lt; most of the major newspapers have ignored the story - the only exception&lt; &lt; being the Washingtonian - which called the idea of E-mail surcharge \"a&lt; useful&lt; &lt; idea who's time has come\"   {March 6th, 1999 Editorial).&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Do not sit by and watch your freedom erode away! Send this to E-mail to&lt; &lt; EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your friends and relatives write&lt; their&lt; &lt; congressional representative and say \"NO\" to Bill 602P. It will onlytake&lt; a&lt; &lt; few moments of your time and could very well be instrumental in killing&lt; &lt; a bill we do not want.   Please forward!&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

After the meeting, we will have the remainder of the day for some fun activities, along with a buffet dinner served that evening to complete the day (on-site dinner location TBD).   Block of Rooms - A block of rooms have been reserved for Government Affairs.   I will be turning in a rooming list to the hotel next week so, I   would like to know by Friday, April 27 your plans to attend the meeting.   Shuttle Service -   See attachment for shuttle times.

However, fares are not guaranteed until actually booked.   Let's book early!!!The activities to choose from are as follows:   Please let me know by May 4 your choice of activity!!!Whitewater Rafting - A bus will leave the Omni Interlocken Resort at 2:000pm to head for an afternoon of exciting adventure on Colorado's Clear Creek.   The Arkansas River is one of the most popular whitewater adventures anywhere, combining spectacular scenery and action packed rapids.   Teamwork is the name of the game as your team paddles down these tumbling cascades.   Continuous class II and IV rapids will thrill guests throughout the run. Drop over Nomad, surge through the Phoenix Holes and take on the class IV climax, the Outer Limits.   Good physical condition and the ability to swim are recommended.   The group will have three thrilling hours on the river and will return to the Omni by 6:15pm.Chautauqua Park Hiking Adventure - One of the most popular access points for mountain hiking trails in Boulder is Chautauqua Park. The focal point is the 1000-year-old dining hall.   The Colorado Chautauqua is one of only four of the original Chautauquas still operating in America, as opposed to when thousands dotted the nation and culturally enriched rural people in the early 19000s. The tour includes: transportation, professional guide service, two hours of guided hiking - total time for excursion is 4 hours. (Dress code: Shorts or hiking attire, appropriate footwear, sunglasses, sunscreen and hats).   Departure time and return will be relayed at a later date.Spa Services -   The Spa at Omni Interlocken Resort offers a number of spa services (massages, facial &amp; skin care treatments, body treatments or nail services, to name a few).   If you are interested in this as an activity, please let me know and I will fax a detailed list of their services.   You will need to call the spa and schedule your own appointment if this is the activity you choose.Golf -   For the golf enthusiasts, an afternoon of golf at the Omni Interlocken 27-hole championship golf course which stretches out over 3000 acres of verdant fairways is another activity to select from.   Spectacular panoramic views from three 9-hole courses, which feature more than 4000 feet in elevation changes.   If this is the activity of choice please respond via e:mail and I will add you to the list.   The game of choice will be \"best ball\" play.Biking -   Scenic bike paths are located near the hotel for those with interest.   If this is your choice of activity, please let me know and I will reserve a bike and map for you enjoyment.After reviewing the choices above, please select an activity you prefer to take part in.   Due to the fact that our group is so large, (which makes it more difficult to coordinate activities) once you select an activity, we ask that you not change your selection.   So, please talk to your colleagues ahead of time before making your choice.Thanks and don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions.Gngr - SuperShuttle.doc - Directions from DIA with map.doc\n"

It's hard to sort out what happened there but perhaps because of LaRence's lack of interest in the area, which he apparently expressed to Brad, he has not done much structuring work and Brad is not inclined to promote him or keep him in the organization.

Several of our offices (Spain, Belgium,Netherlands) have received a local language version of the letteroriginally sent to Jeff Skilling, and other CEOs, on 5 April 20001. Theemail chain below gives an indication of what is in circulation.Greenpeace is expecting a response within the next week. Jackie Gentle hasmade me the point of contact in the PR department for this issue. We havediscussed this issue briefly and we would support issuing an initialstatement to acknowledge receipt of the letters, perhaps followed by astandardised, corporate- approved letter, but would like to ensure ourapproach is supported, and consistent with any actions, by Corporate. Assome of the countries in which we operate have tangible \"green\" focusedprojects e.g. we have acquired a wind project in The Netherlands, it may beappropriate to allow such countries to personalise their response in locallanguage.If we follow up an initial acknowledgement with a fuller response toGreenpeace's questions, I suggest we consider the following issues raisedrecently by Jackie Gentle:\"In response to several requests for clarification, I have spoken with MarkPalmer who has provided the following information on Enron's stanceregarding Kyoto:Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workablesolution to dealing with CO2 emissions.   However it is not the principlesbehind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that hasbeen devised to deliver the results.We firmly believe that there is work to be done in reducing greenhousegases and Enron has put in place a number of programs that have measurablyreduced carbon dioxide as well as SO2 and Oxides of Nitrogen (Nox)By way of example ...   emissions trading programs have been put in place where these can be   implemented   Enron is one of the largest developers of natural gas-fired power plants   which produce about 50 percent less carbon dioxide than coal or   oil-fired plants   demand-side management programs through EES to reduce energy usage   the Catalytica program   focus on renewable-related projectsAt the current time there is no formal statement from Enron Corp on theKyoto issue.\"Before we proceed, I would be grateful if you could contact me to shareyour views on this.Many thanks.Best regardsKateKate BauerManager Public Relations and Communicationsext: 32495---",

The letter is attached way at the bottom of this e-mail, and was received in several Enron European offices as a copy of what was sent to Jeff Skilling and other CEOs of major companies.   I have not confirmed our receipt of such a letter from any of you, but am assuming it was delivered.I think we could respond in a very positive, constructive manner to Greenpeace, based on the statements we've already documented and the strategies we are developing.   Lisa Jacobson and I are currently working on developing some tighter climate change and clean air \"messages\" that we can use in multiple areas ASAP --- upcoming Ken Lay speeches and interactions with the Administration, revising the Statement for the 20001 Corporate Responsibility Report, Enron Business articles and other internal uses, responses to environmental group inquiries and shareholder meeting Q&amp;A, and use in everyday speeches and advocacy work.The Greenpeace questions are tricky, and set up no-win answers for the most part.   I doubt they will get any direct answers to questions like:   \"Does your company support President Bush in his opposition to the protocol?\"   In my opinion, we can respond to Greenpeace without directly responding to these types of questions.   Addressing Kyoto directly is a slippery slope --- its best to stick with the solution-oriented approach we've always taken.For this reason, I was a bit concerned to see in the e-mail chain below a characterization of Mark Palmer's statement on Kyoto (given to Jackie Gentile in London) --- \"Enron has always taken the view that the Kyoto protocol was not a workable solution to dealing with CO2 emissions.   However it is not the principles behind Kyoto that we take issue with, rather it is the vehicle that has been devised to deliver the results.\"   I believe it is dangerous to make such statements for a number of reasons --- Greenpeace would absolutely beat us over the head with it, Friends of the Earth could step up its shareholder initiatives, etc.   Also, this sets you up for a number of follow up questions that I don't think we have answers to, like:   What about Kyoto is not workable?   What would make it workable and would we help make it workable?   If not Kyoto, what is Enron's preferred \"vehicle?\"   I'd really rather stay with a constructive, solution-oriented approach and avoid reference to Kyoto altogether.I will talk with Kate Bauer in Enron Europe about this, but I think we need to decide on a global, corporate-wide response to Greenpeace.   I would be happy to set up a quick conference call on the subject, or just field comments by e-mail --- whatever works best.Thoughts?Jeffrey KeelerDirector, Environmental StrategiesEnronWashington DC office - (202) 4666-9157Cell Phone (203) 464-1541\tLauren Iannarone@ECT\t04/17/20001 111:20 AM \t\t\t To: Jeffrey.Keeler@enron.com\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: Greenpeace letters to Enron Europe concerning our position on KyotoFYI:   I   defer to you on this but assume we are in a good position to respond to Greenpeace.

We were awarded a biosolids dewatering contract in Grand Rapids, Michigan about a month ago.   We had bid against the incumbent, a company called Synagro.   You may recall that Azurix is in litigation with Syangro over a busted acquisition, but the two events are not related.   In any case, we were low bidder, and the recommendation was made to award the contract to us.   Synagro has been working to get the award overturned, and appears to have been successful.   It is not yet clear whether they are going to award the deal to Synagro, or re-bid.   It is not even clear what the grounds are for overturning the award, which indicates that it may be pure politics.   Do we have any good political consultants that could help us in Grand Rapids?   We do not have much of a presence in that area, and were responding to a publicly advertised bid.   Price and technical qualifications were the only issues.   Politics did not enter into it until now, so we were caught a little flat-footed.   Any suggestions?   \n"

Important decisions\rregarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at=\r=20\rthe\rCalifornia Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state Legislature,\rincreasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already percei=\rve\rin the quickly evolving California market. Sudden changes are being made to=\r=20\rthe\rmarket structure, changes that used to require years in California=01,s com=\rplex\rregulatory and legislative proceedings.\r As rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of Northern Califor=\rnia\ron January 17 and 18, including in portions of downtown San Francisco,\rSacramento, and the Silicon Valley, state officials are scrambling to set u=\rp\rthe appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarc=\re\rwestern energy supplies to California=01,s two largest utilities. Even at p=\rrices\rnear $8000 per megawatt-hour (MWh), the California Department of Water=20\rResources\r(CDWR), attempting to buy power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E=\r)\rand Southern California Edison (SCE), has been unable to secure enough to k=\reep\rthe lights on. In the mean time, legal actions by some energy suppliers\rthreaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy=01*and are being held at bay =\ronly=20\rby\rdirect intervention of California=01,s governor.\r Below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently:\r *California governor. California Governor Gray Davis continues to attempt t=\ro\ract on behalf of PG&amp;E and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from\rmerchant generation owners and marketers in California. On the same front, =\rthe\rgovernor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them fr=\rom\rseeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utiliti=\res.\rCourt-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy.\r *Legislature. Bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchas=\res\ron behalf of PG&amp;E and SCE by the CDWR, to restructure the independent syste=\rm\roperator=01,s (ISO) governing board to consist of five members appointed by=\r the\rgovernor, to restrict the ability of the ISO to enter into a broader=20\rinterstate\rregional transmission organization (RTO) without the explicit approval of\rCalifornia=01,s Electricity Oversight Board, and to prohibit the divestitur=\re of\rthe investor-owned utilities=01, remaining generating assets until 20006. Th=\re\rvehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition =\rof\rtransmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still\rbeing developed.\r *California Public Utilities Commission. On January 18 the CPUC adopted a\rdecision prohibiting the sale of SCE=01,s Mohave Generating Station to AES.=\r This\rvoids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed=20\rdecisions\rregarding SCE=01,s application to end its rate freeze and the prudency crit=\reria\rfor utilities entering into long-term supply contracts.\r Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their\rrespective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass=20\rthrough\rmultiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to\rdecrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to\rCalifornia=01,s two largest utilities, or the level of uncertainty in devel=\roping\rnew generation to supply California in the future.\r The ISO anticipates that it will call stage 3 emergencies (reserves less th=\ran\r1.5 percent) for January 19 and will most likely continue to curtail\rinterruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are be=\ring\rstrained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water=20\rsupplies\rare already as much as 25 percent below average, owing to low precipitation=\r=20\rand\rcontinued plant outages near 9,000 MW in California. The gravity of the\rfinancial condition of California=01,s two largest utilities is exemplified=\r by=20\rthe\rneed for other, more creditworthy intermediaries, including California\rmunicipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers,=\r to\ract as temporary   guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PG&amp;=\rE\rand SCE.\r ***end***\r Follow above URL for full report.\r ***\rCome Shoot the Rapids with us at CERAWeek20001, \"Shooting the Rapids:\rStrategies and Risks for the Energy Future\" in Houston, February 12-16, 2000=\r1!\rFor more information and to register, please visit\rhttp:///www20.cera.com/ceraweek/ ***\r   E-mail Category: Alert\rCERA Knowledge Area(s): Western Energy,\r ***\rTo make changes to your cera.com account go to:\rhttp:///www20.cera.com/client/updateaccount   Forgot your username and password?

I also can tell you that the feedback from participants regardingyour briefing has been terrific.We are reviewing all the material this week to begin the process ofre-creating the session on the Secretary's webpage for the Forum, and I willbe going over the video and audio clips for posting.   Recognizing that yourslides were proprietary, it would be most valuable if we could post as muchof your powerpoint briefing as possible---whatever you feel comfortable withsharing.   Whatever that turns out to be, if your staff could email that tome, I will make sure that only that, and not the original that you sent tome, gets posted.I am not sure where the senior leadership of the DoD will be going in thecoming months, however, I know that the discussion of your experience atEnron and the experiences of your panel mates will have an influence.A more formal letter of thanks will be forthcoming, but for now, thank youagain for joining us and helping to make this a memorable and most importantHighlands Forum.Best regards, DickDick O'NeillThe Highlands Grouphttp:///www.highlandsgroup.net301-469-74000301-469-5878 fax\n"

Commissioner Massey kicked off the discussion on this issue citing a transport basis differential into CA of $10, when it was less than a dollar in other areas.   He then noted that the high gas cost would adversely affect the power price under the auction, and that FERC must act regarding the high transport differentials- \"We will never get a handle on electric prices unless we get a handle on gas prices\".   That opened the floodgates of discussion, culminating with the announcement by Commissioner Breathitt of FERC's technical conference (notice of which issued today) on the topic of current and projected interstate pipeline capacity, and adequacy of infrastructure within CA.   She said that this would shed light on basis differentials and gas prices.Freudian slip?   Chairman Hebert was heard to say by various attendees that price mitigation in the WSCC would apply at all times (in contrast to the order, which proposes mitigation only during times when reserves reach/fall below 7%).   Whether he mis-spoke, or not, remains to be seen.   Regarding the issue of how often mitigation would be invoked in CA (i.e., Stages 1, 2 or 3): Hebert opined \"Most of the time\". Breathitt said \"Likely 80-85% of the time\". Massey was unconvinced.Several Senators railed at the Commission for \"not doing its job\" and threatened that if the Commission did not act, Congress would act.If you have any questions or need additional detail, please feel free to call.

House hearing was in the Barton Subcommittee (Energy &amp; Air Quality).   Senate hearing was on last week's FERC order on a \"soft price cap\" and related issues.   The House witnesses were dominated by California officials: Cal Energy Commission, Cal Air Resources Board, Chairman of Gov Davis Generation Implementation Task Force.   In addition, there were witnesses from the Western Area Power Admin and Bonneville PA.   The Senate witnesses were the three FERC commissioners.HIghlightsChairman Barton said it is still his intention to try to mark up the Barton bill, H.R. 1647 next week (many on and off the Subcommittee doubt this will happen; we are gathering political intelligence on those prospects and will report back with more information and conclusions once that is done); Chairman Barton also said he may go to California next week.There was considerable emphasis at both hearings about the alleged role that higher natural gas prices into California play in the electric power rate increases; several witnesses focused on difference in alleged transportation costs for similar differences between California and non-CA states; FERC at the Senate hearing said that today the commission announced a staff technical conference for later this month on all aspects of the natural gas market as it relates to California; a House member from Southern Illinois coal country attacked California for using only natural gas in its new power plants.The House witnesses, primarily BPA but also the California witnesses, attacked the negawatt provision in sec. 102 of the Barton bill; the criticism was that BPA would be forced to purchase power on the open market at a high price since it is short, sell it to the DSIs under contract; let the DSI sell it at market rates and capture the difference; BPA witness said that thus sec. 102 would make it difficult if not impossible to implement their strategy to avoid as much as a 2000 percent rate increase on 10/1/01; BPA testimony will make it tough for Members of Congress from that service region to support sec. 102.Both hearings also touched on how difficult it would be to actually devise a price cap; at the House hearing, none of those advocating a price cap among the witnesses could answer excellent questions about exactly how this could be done; the witnesses just said \"cost plus a reasonable profit\" and said leave the details to FERC; at afternoon Senate hearing, Chairman Hebert had the staff bring in 15 boxes from one FP&amp;L case to show how a price cap would take too long to bring any relief to California this summer; he said last week's soft price cap is much better.Also on the price cap, Rep. Walden (R-OR)   got the Cal Energy Comm chair to admit that if the price caps had been in place earlier, California would NOT have taken the conservation and new generation steps that it has taken recently. The interplay among the FERC commissioners was much more contentious than it was a House hearing on Tuesday, although it could have been worse; when Senate Chairman Murkowski (R-AK) said that \"help is on the way\" in the form of the nominees for the two vacancies, Sen. Dorgan (D-ND) made a comment that suggested that the confirmation process will not be smooth; the same concern came from the interplay among the Senators, which was also somewhat contentious at times.Please advise if you have any questions or would like further details.\n"

I'm not sure we can convince Massey and others not to cap the secondary market for example, but they need to understand the facts before they run off attacking the pipelines:gas utilities in California opposed interstate capacity expansions into the state.gas utilities had just as much opportunity as anyone else to participate in open seasons for capacity.gas utilities fialed to fill storage.gas utilites have failed to build adequate take away capacity at the Cal borderI suspect Socal gas is using its interstate capacity and its in state storage to line its own pockets.In short, if FERC wants to get to the bottom of the problem they need to look in California, not outside.Ray Alvarez05/04/20001 09:02 AMTo: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enroncc:   Subject: House and Senate Energy Hearings Today on California/Western Electric SituationSteve, I've been thinking about the intense preoccupation with gas prices lately and decided to pass this info along because I think it's a red flag.   My concern is that there might not only be a backlash affecting our interstate pipelines, but that our gas marketing efforts might be adversely affected.   It might well be found that the holders of the firm capacity (i.e. marketers?), and not the pipes themselves, are at \"fault\" for the large basis differentials between the basins and the CA delivery points.   Whoever is blamed might not really matter.   My gut feeling is that the other shoe is about to drop, with calls for price caps on gas commodity prices into the West.   This, of course, could affect years of effort on the gas marketing side in establishing competitive markets.   Pipeline open access is of no avail if there is government intervention in the gas markets.   Commissioner Massey, Senator Feinstein and other Western Senators were saying some very concerning things about gas prices, the impacts in their states and that something needed to be done.   FERC responded with an announcement of their technical conference on interstate pipeline capacity   and intrastate take away capacity (which, by the way, doesn't appear to address storage).   Everyone wants an explanation as to why the basis differential is much higher than in other states, since they thought it should only consist of transport costs.   Ray---"

Market based rate applications for transmission-owning utilities merit the same level of scrutiny as that given to merger applications, i.e., a competitive screening analysis followed by a more detailed behavioral analysis whenever the screen reveals potential market power.   Modernizing this type of market power analysis required with market based rate applications is of equal importance to that of improving the analysis for merger applications, as recognized by the Commission in its recent Filing Requirements Rulemaking, Order No. 642, Revised Filing Requirements Under Part 333 of the Commission's Regulations, 93 F.E.R.C. ? 61,164, 65 Fed.

Credit worthiness will be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).   This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.   This is essentially the PG&amp;E/QF \"deal\" for the gas guys.   For the renewables, it is more of a fixed payment approach. A \"Technical Conference\" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to work out some of the implementing details.\n"

I attended a meeting this afternoon of the Coalition of Service Industries, one of the lead groups promoting a wide range of services including energy services in the upcoming WTO GATTS 2000 negotiations. CSI President Bob Vastine was in Delhi last week and met with CII to discuss the upcoming WTO. CII apparently has a committee looking into the WTO. Bob says that he told them that energy services was among the CSI recommendations and he recalls that CII said that they too have an interest.Since returning from the meeting I spoke with Kiran Pastricha and told her the above. She actually arranged the meeting in Delhi. She asked that I send her the packet of materials we distributed last week in Brussels and London. One of her associates is leaving for India tomorrow and will take one of these items to Delhi. JoeJoe Hillings09/08/999 111:57 AMTo: Sanjay Bhatnagar/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ashok Mehta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES, Jeffrey Sherrick/Corp/Enron@Enron (bcc: Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron)Subject: India And The WTO Services NegotiationSanjay: First some information and then a request for your advice and involvment.A group of US companies and associations formed the US WTO Energy Services Coalition in late May and has asked the US Government to include \"energy services\" on their proposed agenda when the first meeting of the WTO GATTS 2000 ministerial convenes late this year in Seattle. Ken Lay will be among the CEO speakers. These negotiations are expected to last three years and cover a range of subjects including agriculture, textiles, e-commerce, investment, etc.This morning I visited with Sudaker Rao at the Indian Embassy to tell him about our coalition and to seek his advice on possible interest of the GOI. After all, India is a leader in data processing matters and has other companies including ONGC that must be interested in exporting energy services. In fact probably Enron and other US companies may be engaging them in India and possibly abroad.Sudaker told me that the GOI has gone through various phases of opposing the services round to saying only agriculture to now who knows what. He agrees with the strategy of our US WTO Energy Services Coalition to work with companies and associations in asking them to contact their government to ask that energy services be on their list of agenda items. It would seem to me that India has such an interest. Sudaker and I agree that you are a key person to advise us and possibly to suggest to CII or others that they make such a pitch to the GOI Minister of Commerce.I will ask Lora to send you the packet of materials Chris Long and I distributed in Brussels and London last week. I gave these materials to Sudaker today.Everyone tells us that we need some developing countries with an interest in this issue. They may not know what we are doing and that they are likely to have an opportunity if energy services are ultimately negotiated.Please review and advise us how we should proceed. We do need to get something done in October.JoePS Terry Thorn is moderating a panel on energy services at the upcoming World Services Congress in Atlanta. The Congress will cover many services issues. I have noted in their materials that Mr. Alliwalia is among the speakers but not on energy services. They expect people from all over the world to participate.\n"

      "body": "\nThanks so much for your message.   Your communications are always complete, firm, clear and polite.   I am sorry that perhaps the most critical aspect of your efforts --- security--- has been so confused by our end.   I understand from John Brindle that the confusion generated by our end has not kept you from accomplishing a great deal of the work anyway.   I have asked John to lead the effort, to the extent you need him.   John and his team are very experienced and have been in contact with and coordination with the London office.   Mike Hicks is a good hand, but for the most part, all I have asked him to do is be in a position to identify outside resources skilled in the area in question.   It is a bit too much to ask Mike to be hands on for all of Enron's corporate security needs.   A little background I'll bore you with:   after Andre Legallo (formerly VP of Security for Enron) left, we did not replace his function.   Most of the operating companies had their own security and business controls groups.   When Andre left, we reduced the corporate function to a \"default provider\" role --- if a business unit had a need it was not otherwise meeting, Mike Hicks (as well as an outside consulting firm) would help identify competent resources in the area.   With the reorganization of EBS, I have inherited the very competent and experienced team they had assembled (led by John Brindle).   John identified some concerns regarding India mid last week.   I urged him to get in touch with Rebecca; he did.   It was clear after further inquiries by John that the India team had already addressed many if not all of the concerns and much of the remaining work involved implementation.   John volunteered to send some people over to help and I said OK.   He had already been in touch with the London team and Mike Hicks (who I have asked to return to Houston).The last thing you need right now is confusion caused by a group saying \"we're from corporate and we're here to help\".   If you don't need any \"help\" or if the situation gets anything other than significantly better, let me know.To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Rebecca McDonald/Enron@EnronXGate, James A Hughes/Enron@EnronXGate Subject: India HelpSteve,As you are well aware, we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India. We are using several parts of your team, and are very pleased with most. I want to mention a couple of areas, HR and Security.1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20 hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR, and Drew had his team there for us.2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team on the ground, and John has provided leadership and all coordination with Houston. Great efforts and productive work.3. Security: This area has not worked as well, and if you ever want feedback on our one-time experience with this group, I will provide it. I don't have any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night, and Mike has informed us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate with that person.On a side note, the people who have really been helpful were brought in through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he would come.At Mike's earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill &amp; Associates to help on security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been overseeing include coordinating with Hill &amp; Associates, removing (in a lowkey yet rush manner) over 4000 boxes of files and documents and getting them through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from servers, desktops and laptops. In addition, she has coordinated security for all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony Duenner of EBS Asia.Again, we appreciate all the help. Wade\n"

Enron is a supporter of WWP, and Joe Sutton is on their corporate cabinet.   What do you think about her idea below, and Enron's involvement, if any?   Please feel free to pass this along to others who you think might want to consider it, or who might be more appropriate to consider it.Thanks, Stacy   x3-3583I have an interesting idea that I wanted to share with you.   Just last weekhere at the Kennedy School, I met with a woman named Susan Bird, who sitson the Women's Leadership Board of the Kennedy School.   She is the Founderand President of Women.future in New York City, NY.   She headed the launchof the organization (part of which was held here at KSG, the main body ofwhich was held in NYC and telecast to KSG).   It was a masterfully conceivedand brilliantly orchestrated three-phase global event for businesswomen.   Iimagine you heard about it.Susan told me last week that one of her current, burning interests is inhow women business leaders (corporate leadership across the private andpublic sectors) can change and influence public policy.   She wants tocreate a public venue, invite women business leaders, and discuss thecentral question, \"If we assume that today's global problems require moreand more from the business world, would these problems look any differentif women business leaders/owners were involved?\"Susan and I wonder if this is something Enron (and/or potentially othercorporate sponsors) would like formally to sponsor.   Furthermore, Susan'scompany could video this executive forum, streamline the video, and link itto the Women Waging Peace Website.   My sense is that it's a win-win foreveryone.I told her that I would contact you and discuss the possibility.   Wouldlove to hear your thoughts first, before I engage in further conversationwith Susan.   If this is something in which Enron is interested, I couldeasily arrange a phone conversation among Swanee, Susan, you, and me in thenear future to discuss the idea in greater depth.I am available for a conversation about the idea anytime, and I can bereached directly at (617) 495-83330.\n"

Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan.While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services.kind regards Nicholas O'Day08/29/2000 07:43 PMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES, Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Mika Watanabe/AP/Enron, Takashi Kimura/AP/Enron Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister   Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 6000 of Japan's corporate leaders.The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation.kind regards\n"

Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious conference on IT in Japan.While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services.kind regards Nicholas O'Day08/29/2000 07:43 PMTo: Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES, Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Mark Schroeder/LON/ECT@ECT, Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON, Mika Watanabe/AP/Enron, Takashi Kimura/AP/Enron Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister   Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for approximately 6000 of Japan's corporate leaders.The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the seminar. Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the key note speaker's presentation.kind regards\n"

PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal eBiz publication.   I am working on a story about the recent issue with respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to President Bush's as well as the coal industry.   I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher electricity prices causing problems similar to California.   I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees.   A quote from you about this issue would be great.   I would also be interested in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2.Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks, Ann Schmidt (x54694) \n"

Comments welcome\"The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy.   His decision was based on some very important factors --- the nation's energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form.   \"I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative \"anti-environment\" reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations.   Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts of action regulate CO2 emissions.\"\"\"The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market.   We are well-positioned through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management.\"\"\"A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint.   Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way.   If we're able to make meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants --- NOx, SO2 and mercury --- and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on CO2 whether it is regulated or not.\"In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy and environmental problems.---"

MITI and the Government are currently examining why the initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and looking to move the 20003 review forward to next year. There are currently two multi party committees looking at the energy sector. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy. In addition, MITI is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to consider the next stage of deregulation. As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved. Recently, with the addition of Kimura, we have increased our level of contact with senior political figures in Japan.Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enron's views on issues relating to the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity deregulation. We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist in the deregulation process in a positive way.What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be structured in the future.Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will receive a cabinet position if Gov. Bush is elected. As a result, Mr Lay currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in Japan. In the period prior to the Presidential election, we have an ideal opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese Government through Mr Lay.A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government members would significantly increase Enron's profile in Japan and assist in conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation.If Mr Lay were to visit Japan, possibly in late October or early November, we would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and arrange a number of high level commercial meetings. Prime Minister Mori and the US Ambassador have already expressed an interest in attending the office opening. Both Joe Hirl and I would like to speak with you further about the above. When would be a convenient time?kind regards \n"

As we get things organized here I want to do a better job of maximizing the use of our corporate execs when they are in town.   This is hard to do without some advance notice of travel arrangements.   I do not want to be intrusive but I do think we can bring added value to Enron's presence in DC.   What most immediately brings this to mind is that I learned from news sources today that Ken is giving a speech (participating via panel) at the Club for Growth's event tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. in Senate Dirksen.   We have been busily planning all of Enron executives' trips to the inaugural and I thought I had something of a handle on each executive's itinerary.   So this came as a surprise.   A second   problem with this is that it is being hosted by Craig Shirley Associates.   I am told by Cynthia that Craig Shirley Assoc. is the group that last year hired private investigators to ferret out our tactics and strategies on electric restructuring.   Ken may not know this relationship.   Some vetting of the invite might have brought this to his attention.   I appreciate your thoughts on this and how I can most effectively add our input.   Thanks.\n"

Time is of the essence and noton your side.   Nor are the facts &amp; the law on your side.   Therefore, youneed to find a way to get us to be on your side.   Due to the urgency and foreseeable and announced forthcoming eventhorizons, I believe you may wish to provide copies of the attached tothe proper persons at Enron for their immediate attention.   Please letthem know that if I have to continue to give information &amp; documents tothe U.S. Senate and the proper others, that I will do so and then alsoshow that the failure of Hughes interests/companies to take remedialmeasures was indeed blatant refusal.   We have already logged whereHughes companies/interests have been tohttp:///willgriffin.com/hughes.htm thus you might as well continue tovisit there and see where we have posted changes and new information.The knowledge of the Hughes companies/interests of these matters is nowclearly established.   We've already submitted some of our visitor logsand other documents to the proper others, establishing the knowledge ofHughes companies/interests to others.   This is something I am sure willbe most meaningful to the lawyers, along with a few other things I'msure which will get their attention...   Also please have someone forward the attached to William RiceLummis, James A. Baker and others and advise them that surprises,attention getters &amp; wake-up calls are just around the corner.   They needto contact us soon, before it becomes improper to discuss how areasonable (fanny &amp; facing-saving) resolve for Hughesinterests/companies may be achieved.Will Griffinhttp:///willgriffin.com/hughes.htmX-Mozilla-Status2: 000Message-ID: &lt;3A8970D3.C2FBB4441@bellsouth.net&lt;Date: Tue, 13 Feb 20001 111:37:24 -06000From: Will Griffin &lt;griffgrp@bellsouth.net&lt;Organization: Griffin GroupX-Mailer: Mozilla 4.7 [en]C-bls40   (Win95; U)X-Accept-Language: enMIME-Version: 1.0To: corpcomm@hughes.com, diana.ball@hsc.com,   investor-relations@enron.com, parkem@hhmi.org,   brickhil@hhmi.org, stumpfs@hhmi.org, mullinsr@hhmi.org,   james.doty@bakerbotts.com, bruce.kiely@bakerbotts.com,   walter.smith@bakerbotts.com, tolson@gibsondunn.com,   whowell@gibsondunn.comSubject: Advisory of Your Legal/Political Exposures Coming TrueContent-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=\"---C4135F3BD40002931C95C2CA\"Dear Hughes Electronics, Enron, HHMI, and Hughes Lawyers, et. al:   I am fully aware how many of the Hughes interests visitedhttp:///willgriffin.com/hughes.htm after I sent you an e-mail on Feb. 6,20001, advising you of your impending difficulties and exposures.   I have made some changes to these Hughes related pages, includingposting my advisory to you to http:///willgriffin.com/letterto.htm foryour convenience and reference, with active e-mail links to you and eachother.   Also since I contacted you last week (the next day), Enron has beenin the news as being the biggest beneficiary of the California energywoes, while also being the largest contributor, fund-raiser and generalbenefactor to President George W. Bush.http:///www0.mercurycenter.com:80/premium/business/docs/enron07.htmAnother article goes even further showing the relationship of JamesAddison Baker II to Enron and Hughes \"Bush's Biggest Donors Gain FromHigh Prices in California Crunch\"http:///www.villagevoice.com:80/issues/0106/ridgeway3.shtml   You may wish to re-visit the updatedhttp:///willgriffin.com/hughes.htm (refesh/reload the page to clear yourbrowser's cache of the previous copy) after reviewing the news articleslinks about Enron provided above.   You should know and reasonablyforesee that you are not the only visitors to my Hughes pages.   Youshould also know that I've had contact with the proper authorities andthis to include correspondences within this past week.   Then again, I'msure many in the pipeline of those who review this and my previousadvisory know this to be true, or to reasonably foresee the interest ofmany others at a minimum.   I believe you to foresee more to soon become public difficulties foryou and that the intensity will no doubt increase significantly.   Youshould know that any political related problems will include Democratsin volumes, but there exists quite a few Republicans who will disavowand distance themselves from you.   The China-Hughes missile &amp; satellitetechnology transfers, that were cited in the Cox Committee report, andthe arming of Sadaam Hussein with Hughes technologies issues are aboutto pop up their heads and see a longer shadow than the groundhogrecently did.   This, in addition to the recent articles about Enron,current activities and forthcoming event horizons, is not good news forHughes interests.   You just might want to ask William Rice Lummis and James A. BakerII, et. al. how they intend to solicit the help of the guy who holdsthe keys to resolve, who they've got a little miffed at them, because ofwhat was done to him in an ad hominem attempt.   Certainly, when it istrue that if he now does nothing and a profound correlation existsbetween how bad things go for you and how good things go as a result forhim, then why should he help y'all?   It appears if you ask Mr. Bakerabout the Matter of Hughes and how we hold the keys to an amiableresolve, that he will stipulate that it will take some real \"Politics ofDiplomacy\" to persuade us to help you, but that this needs to beurgently accomplished.Will Griffin - griffgrp.vcf - griffgrp.vcf\n"

There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one thing we also want, people.   I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.

Recently, Chris Calger has asked me to set up a meeting with Sempra.   ENA's seeking deals with the two big CA gas IOUs (PG&amp;E and SoCalGas) that would give ENA access to their assets.   In short, ENA wants to offer a complete outsource deal for the IOUs' core gas load (i.e., rez and small commercial customers).   ENA would take responsibility for providing service for delivery at the city gate and in return would manage all of core's assets (upstream of the city gate).   We're meeting with Sempra's \"Chief Regulatory Office\" (Bill Reed) and Sempra's CFO next Thursday to discuss.Given the fact that Sempra's primarily focused on electricity, the plan is to lead off the meeting with a couple of electricity solutions as a bridge to the gas offer.   For electricity, the plan has two pieces:   1) a commodity offer that beats the 6.5 cent cap (i.e., nothing fancy) and 2) \"Deal Bench\" services with the intent of establishing a procurement mechanism for SDG&amp;E that the California PUC could pre-approve (thereby eliminating some of the immense regulatory risk SDG&amp;E now faces).Wanted to run this by folks to gauge reactions.   We'll distribute the slides we're putting together as soon as they're drafted---hopefully by COB Friday.Best,Jeff\n"

It is looking positive that he may be positioned to make the announcement Monday.   However, DOE will likely need to revisit some folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet   like APX, Altra, and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.)   Too, I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel as a model since their timeline was slow, but rather suggest the TVA Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only four meetings.   I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week.

Bob appeared comfortable with establishing a \"Blue Ribbon\" panel, similar to the reliability panel, to address this issue.   In fact, Bob suggested that the reliability panel, which includes a balance of key stakeholders, could be re-tasked with this issue.We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure (governance, segments, executive committees) and scope of the organization (retail, wholesale, gas, electric).

Two weeks ago I met with the Mayor and City Attorney on the Mayor's political business and they told me of their concern about the future of Azurix.   They wanted some assurance from Ken or Jeff that Azurix would be around as a part of Enron if it were awarded the Northeast Water Plant Project.   I believe they had some communications with Azurix officials but they really wanted to hear from someone at Enron.I sent the word back to Enron through Joe, that someone high up should contract the Mayor and the City Attorney to give them whatever assurance they could concerning their concerns. I believe Joe discussed this with Steve.Last Wednesday night I saw the Mayor and asked him if his request through me had any results.   Had he heard from Enron?   He said no, and that he needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix.I assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my conversation I would think we need to give some communication to the Mayor from someone high up in the Enron organization.George\n"

He has been an articulate critic of the current state of ourelectricity markets, and we definitely would like the genco perspectiverepresented.Naturally we are hoping to get a quick answer because our publicity aboutthe conference will be going out shortly.A brief description of the conference is appended below. Please let me knowif you need any additional information.Thanks very much for your help and advice.LeeThe summer of San Diego has prompted the School, in collaboration with UC'sEnergy Institute and Competition Policy Center, to sponsor a high-levelsummit conference on electricity deregulation. The focus, and the audience,will be national, but heavily informed and influenced by the Californiacrisis.   The conference will evaluate (1) the wisdom of deregulation and (2)how the pitfalls encountered so far can be avoided and remedied. TheUniversity will facilitate an open, honest and reasoned exchange betweenexecutive-level players from various perspectives: industry, regulators,consumers, legislators, academics, and market and system operators.The format entails two roundtable discussions with six speakers and amoderator.   During the panel sessions, the speakers will engage in adebate/dialogue on the current situation in electricity deregulation, wherewe have come from, what the future holds, and what solutions lie on thehorizon. Each speaker will have uninterrupted time to speak, followed by Q&amp;Aand discussion.   We expect a live audience of about 2000, including a largepress presence.   One sponsor has tentatively offered to provide internetstreaming video services.   We hope to have a balanced group of sponsorsranging from the American Public Power Association to energy companies.The speakers are being arranged at this time. We have commitments from:Loretta Lynch (Chair, CPUC), and PJM CEO Phil Harris. We have a preliminaryacceptance from Steven Littlechild (England's former primary electricityregulator) and Laura Tyson (former Chair, President's Council of EconomicAdvisors and National Economic Council, currently Dean, Haas School ofBusiness). We have invited FERC Commissioner Curt Hebert, and U.S.Representative EdwardMarkey, executive-level managers from several energy companies and statelegislators. Former DOJ chief economist Carl Shapiro will be on one of thepanels, as will economist Severin Borenstein, Director of UCEI and Professorof Business and Public Policy. Michael Florio from The Utility ReformNetwork (TURN) will be a consumer advocate on one of the panels. LeeFriedman, economist and Professor of Public Policy, will briefly provide anintroduction to the panel discussions with his talk \"Lighting the Stage: TheElectricity of Deregulation.\"A dinner for the panelists and organizers will be hosted at UC's GoldmanSchool of Public Policy following the conference proceedings. We havereserved rooms for our speakers at Berkeley's landmark Claremont Hotel. Wecan reimburse those speakers who request it for coach airfare expenses andother ordinary local expenses.Forfurther information, please contact:Lee S.

Personally, I would like to attend but don't have much interest in speaking (assuming that they would allow low lifes like you or me to speak).   Your call on all of this.   Call bob Badeer with questions about the BEEP as I am heading out of town in a couple of hours.Tim:   I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.   So I'd rather keep our powder dry and use Skilling at another time.   Not top-shelf enough in my view.   If you want to discuss further let me know.Also, one question:Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?   I have that right?---"

They made the following points:\r The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20\rissues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).\rThe Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but=\r=20\rthey put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=\r,=20\ra big part of the problem is a \"dysfunctional market\" --- a thinly veiled=20\rreference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.\rThe Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20\rcustomers and generators) must \"behave responsibly\".\rEveryone must \"share the pain\".\rThe legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20\rreturns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=\rve=20\rproposals in the next couple of weeks.\rWhile staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the=\r=20\rattached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was=\r=20\rfairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.\r The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of=\r=20\rnew information.   The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments=\r=20\rabout the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=\ron=20\rsiting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.   The=20\rstaff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=\rt=20\rremains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=\rnd=20\rremain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=\rte=20\r(at least at peak times), etc.   One approach they appear to be toying with =\ris=20\ra \"share the pain\" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=\re=20\rdeferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=\rrm=20\rof higher rates.   That leaves generators ... who they might want to either=\r=20\ragree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.\r The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis=\r=20\radministration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the=\r=20\rproblem. =20\r I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.   We should, as=\r=20\ralways, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.   I think we should=20\rprepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)=\r=20\rthat takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar=\rd=20\r(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps=\r=20\rthem in a more political context.   In other words, we have already=20\rarticulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20\raround our proposals --- a set of arguments which responds directly to the=\r=20\rpolitical opposition those answers are likely to encounter.

I think that tying rankings to clear objectives does not reflect the fluidity of our charge, though, and will lead to expectations which may not be met.   I also feel strongly that the ranking needs to be a relative one --- I would go to a pure number system.   We are going to need to assess at each PRC whether the organization is strong (in which case I think it's ok to have a disproportionate number of high ratings) or whether the organization has weaknesses that force us to grade tougher.   You don't get that in an absolute system with preset expectations.   I think your group in particular has done a good job of emphasizing team work ( and punishing those who don't play well) so we need not create a competitive or jockeying environment so long as that emphasis is communicated explicitly.I agree with Paul's points about giving clear, specific feed back (though I don't think we can give a clear target for what one must accomplish to be superior).   I also like the idea of the abbreviated mid year PRC to deal with those we need to counsel more vigorously.   I'm not sure we can get away with it but I am willing to give it a shot.I think Paul is to be complimented for taking time to focus on the larger organizational issues ... very vice presidential of him... no overstepping of bounds ... quite the contrary.\tRichard Shapiro@EES\t10/31/2000 02:52 PM \t\t\t To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: PRC StuffCan we discuss?---"

I tried to apply the information you provided and to describe qualities of an employee's performance . I'm   not sure whether this is any better, but would appreciate your input.   What I am finding most challenging writing descriptors which are interchangeable with all levels and job groups within the company.   The behaviors these describe and measure need to be general in nature so that they can apply to a VP and an admin assistant, as well as to all four Peer Groups within Enron.   Likewise, I would appreciate your thoughts on the necessity/value of changing the feedback forms to reflect the same numerical ratings.   presently the feedback forms use the same descriptors as the cluster (i.e. Superior - Issues).   In your opinion should these also be 1-5 ratings with one = to highest and 5= to lowest in scale?   I look forward to hearing your thoughts and impressions.   You may either e-mail me or call me on 713 345-333777.

I want to know if you want to go in with me. He'll getthe PC in the near future but I don't expect anyone to contribute until hisbirthday.Here's the way it would work: we give Phil a new PC, I send an old Compaq ofours to Kathy and Alan Wedig, Phil sends his old PC to some friends of minewho live in Duluth, MN.   That means that our entire family will beconnected.If not, I would send the Old Compaq to Phil otherwise and then he could sendhis old one to Kathy and Alan.   The only problem with this scenario is thatPhil's old PC is getting a little too old.   Our friends in Duluth wouldn'tmind getting an old PC because they've never owned one.   I thought that Philwould benefit the most from getting a brand new PC.   The old Compaq is willstill be okay for a while and Kathy should be fine with it.What do you guys think?   If i do this right, Kathy would have a PC for herbirhtday in March.Rob\n"

It is forthcoming in the next Harvard Business Review and will send you some reprints once the magazine hits the newsstands. Also wanted to gauge your interest in a possible even at the Harvard Business School in April 20001.   We are currently finalizing our plans for the Entrepreneurial Manager---a first year course on entrepreneurship taken by all 1,000 of our MBA students.   As part of the course, we will feature an entrepreneurial company as the capstone class in the course.   Last year we featured Intuit, taught an Intuit case study and hosted Scott Cook who spoke to the entire MBA class.   The session was a huge success---the highest rated class in our course and had a lasting impact on how our students think about entrepeneurship.   We were wondering whether you and your colleagues might be interested in being our featured company this year.   If you decided to proceed, we would first write a case study focused on the process of creating new ventures within Enron.   The case would probably consist of three portions:   an overview of the Enron corporation, an in-depth description of one or two ventures successfully formed in the past, and a profile of someone currently attempting to start a new venture within Enron.   In preparing the case, we would draw heavily on existing case studies, articles, and book chapters profiling Enron to avoid duplicating effort.   We would then supplement our desk research by interviewing approximately 15-20 Enron employees, including top management team members (especially Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling), some folks involved in past ventures, and the people currently attempting to start a new venture.   Each interview would take approximately 60 minutes.   We could probably complete the bulk of the interviews in a two to three day visit to Enron, supplemented by telephone interviews.   The ideal timing for these interviews from our perspective would be the last week of November or the first few weeks of December.   We would then return to Boston, write a draft of the case and then submit that to you for review and clearance in January.   We could then make any last minute changes before distributing the case to the students for the April discussion.   In addition to writing the case study, we would like to invite a group of Enron executives to HBS when we discuss the case in April.   The ideal date would be the 27th of April, but we could schedule the Enron day the 23rd, 24th or 25th if the 27th were impossible for you.   Last year Intuit sent along six folks---some junior, some senior---each of whom sat in at least one of our class discussions.   In addition, Scott Cook spoke to the entire MBA class.   We would like to follow the same format this year, so it would be super if either Jeff or Ken (or in the best of all worlds, both!) could speak to the MBAs as a whole.   With Intuit last year, we kicked off at about 8:30 and wrapped everything up by approximately 1:000.   We would shoot for roughly similar timing this year.   Many of our students equate entrepreneurship with start-ups, and this day is designed to show them that it is possible (although extremely difficult) for large companies to be entrepreneurial.   As such, you and your colleagues would be providing an invaluable service to our students, and we would be deeply grateful for your contribution.   The event might also have some direct benefits to Enron in terms of increased profile among our students.   If you were interested, we could also explore opportunities to leverage this event to further increase Enron's profile as a leader of the New Economy.   We might, for instance, bundle the case study with a teaching note and edited video as a module on \"entrepreneurship in large companies\" and distribute it to other business schools through Harvard Business School press.   My colleagues and I would be most grateful for your cooperation and would be happy to explore ways that you might increase your return on the time invested.   Please let me know if this opportunity might be of interest to you and your colleagues and how you would like to proceed.   I very much look forward to hearing from you.   DonDonald N.

I read an interesting lawreview article   on \"The Imposition of Martial Law in the United States,\" fora discussion of presidential powers.   There is no general emergencyauthority granted the President in the U.S.   Constitution.   Also, thearticle discussed the famous \"Truman steel mills case,\" Youngstown Sheet &amp;Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), in which the Supreme Court declaredunconstitutional President Truman's seizure of the steel mills during theKorean War.   In that case, in light of a threatened national-wide strike inthe national steel industry, President Truman, concerned about the nationaldefense, issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of Commerce totake possession of most of the steel mills and keep them running.   TheSupreme Court said that if the President had authority to take such   anaction, he had to derive it either from an act of Congress or theConstitution itself.   Since the Supreme Court could not find any seizureauthority, it invalidated the President's action.   The Supreme Court alsorejected the argument that the President had any powers that could beimplied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution.Based on the Truman steel mills case, I thought it the wiser course ofaction to look for specific authorities given to the President by statutewhich might prove useful.I could look into this question further, if you would like, but we would beentering \"martial law-type\" legal territory, where the President would beacting outside of specific Constitutional or congressional authority (whichhas been described a \"zone of twilight\"), and in light of the Truman steelmills case, I don't know how fruitful that might be.Please let me know if you would like me to do anything more.

Donna sent me this quick write up about what she has looked into so far.   Because these questions go beyond a FERC practitioner's expertise, we asked Donna to work with a Constitutional Law expert at V&amp;E to determine whether, and under what circumstances, the President's authority may be extended beyond the authorities discussed in the memo.

I could solicit the members of ARM to identify a key customer contacts for interviews.   We could check with our lobbyists and see who they would recommend (wine growers, dairy industry, etc.)   We should also consider the water agencies and the rural counties and the City of Pittsburg.   While the immediate message is responding to San Diego's situation, this latter group of potential coalition members would go to the larger message (keeping benefits of competitive markets) from a state-wide perspective.

This obviously takes a lot of my time as well because of its importance, in some ways   like you or Stan Horton, in terms of drivers of my P&amp;L.   However, Jose manages this pretty much on his own without much involvement from Houston (it is a local effort by its nature), which was the point I was making at the PRC.   He has a good grasp of the commercial, regulatory and political elements of all of this and keeps them all balanced well.   He is methodical and systematic (which can also be perceived as not especially dynamic), and English is really his second language, which may have hurt him in the PRC.   He is on the job I would wager as much as 80 hours a week.   Do we have anyone at his level with as much or more responsibility elsewhere in the company?---",

They list a fundraising goal of $1,6660,000 (just a bit aggressive!)   If we are not able to make an additional contribution,   he asks that we renew our 20001 annual membership of $40,000 now instead of in January of 20001.   If we do anything, my recommendation would be to cut a check now for our annual membership (the downside of doing that, of course, is that they will hit us a number of times in 20001 for incremental contributions to specific events/causes).I bring this to your attention for two reasons-one is that if I know Governor Gilmore, he will probably make a call directly to Ken Lay and you and Steve may want to have an answer available if Mr. Lay gets the call.   Secondly, what are your thoughts on my response to RGA?   My preference would be to not commit to any additional dollars, with a fall back that if Gilmore does call Lay and he wants to respond positively, we then commit to renewing our membership early.   I think you are pretty busy over the next few days---please respond as your schedule allows.   THanks.\n"

This is another indication that a 'travel policy' for travelers to Colombia should be in effect.   What happened to the one we were discussing earlier?   The steps outlined there would go a long way in improving the security of our travelers.Control Risks' report discusses responses to the media - be sure you have the approval of Enron's media people before making any response.The report also recommends suspending bidding on new projects - probably not viable advice, but reinforces the importance that additional security measures be built into all new projects from day one.Now that our name is in front of the Colombian public, we could see retaliation for various acts, not all of which we have control over.   Recent US Government actions such as extraditing criminals to the US for trial and training Colombian anti-drug troops have done little to endear American businesses to the Colombian public, who see such actions as interfering with Colombia's right to govern themselves.   These actions have significantly raised the risk of all American companies and their employees in Colombia.A meeting I had about two years ago with David Beddow of Control Risks in Bogota indicated that we could see some changes in the methods of attack in urban areas by FARC/ELN.   With an elevated risk level, we should begin thinking about these threats.   FARC seldom uses the car bomb method of attack because it generates little interest among the domestic or international media.   FARC plans on using letter bombs mailed to select targets, i.e., head of an American-owned corporation who may have an office in Bogota.   This method will generate headlines in the press and generate a fear of FARC among businessmen who may be targets.   Control Risks' reported timetable for this change in FARC's tactics was to be three to five years, but now that our risk is higher, the timetable may well be moved up.On a related note - did you employ the security person we recommended?Please let me know how I can help you.Regards,Mike HicksGabriel Sanchez-Sierra@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/05/999 08:15 PMTo: David Haug/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Frank Stabler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shawn Cumberland/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Michael Hicks@ECT, Elaine Rodriguez/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Security Assessment ReportFYI please find attached the \"Security Assessment Report \" carried out   by Control Risk   .

Long time no talk.   I hope you are well - I KNOW you are busy!   Ijust have a couple of matters for your attention:1.   We, as part of a group of Northwest IOUS, are exploring the possibility ofretaining former Montana Governor Racicot to work BPA issues on our behalf. PGE will continue with Mike Andrews as our lobbyist but Racicot would work forthe IOUs as a group.   Does this cause you any concerns?   Incidentally, we maystep up our efforts somewhat in the general area of BPA because of thesituation out here.   Please let me know if I or Mike should be coordinatingwhat we do with any of your folks in DC.2.   One of the major Northwest issues is who will be the next BPAAdministrator.   For a variety of reasons, there really aren't any goodcandidates from the Northwest and we're probably all to close to the situationanyway.   I was wondering if the Enron net could come up with any good ideasfor someone with good energy and policy experience from outside the Northwest? Someone who would appeal to the Bush administration?   3.   With the delay in closing our sale to Sierra, we would very much like theability to use Enron Online for trading.   I believe we can get the regulatoryapprovals necessary but apparently when we raised this some months ago, therewas strong opposition from within Enron, particularly Joe Hartsoe.   Do you seean issue with pursuing this?   How do you suggest I move this forward?Thanks, Steve.   As you may hear from time to time, things are going well herein Oregon.   We are proceeding on our restructuring, which is beginning to getnotice from NARUC and others as a possible model for states that have not yetproceeded.   It's an interesting world.   I look forward to hearing from you.\n"

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants).   Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.   Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.   Their message was simple (and simplistic):El Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.   It's attached.   Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics.Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling.Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of   the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.Best,Jeff\n"

The discussioncovered the chances of stand-alone reliability legislation.Where do you stand on this issue?As you are aware, ELCON has been opposed to any kind of stand-alonelegislation --- including reliability.   At first, we were not stronglyopposed to the stand-alone reliability piece.   However, we have become moreopposed as time has passed and we have seen how the vertically-integratedrecalcitrant utilities have been able dominate NERC and stifle anyprogressive market-oriented movement.   We think things would be as bad ---if not worse --- with the stand-alone creation of NAERO.   The establishmentof NAERO --- alone --- would not be good for the development of markets.Given this, we are concerned about how things are going.   However, wearen't doing much on our own since we would be very ineffective.   We areopen to ideas.John\n"

      "body": "\nI believe it is timely to discuss this again and I agree with Cynthia that stand alone legislation does nothing to address the essential transmission structural issues.I am open minded on the issue if someone can make a compelling case to support stand alone legislation, BUT my gut reaction is that it would be   a serious mistake.   Congress would happily put off dealing with this issue for years if it passes reliability only legislation.   I think the legislation itself makes little or no progress on our issues and may even set us back on making progress at FERC and in other fora.I realize that if this gets going it may be hard to stop, but it would be such a cynically ineffective approach to the real reliability problems that we should help whomever we can to put a stop to it.   If it gets through committee, I have no confidence in this Congress to actually amend it into something better and broader, so, again, I have difficulty seeing why we should go that route.I look forward to the discussion.Cynthia Sandherr@ENRON07/17/2000 02:20 PMTo: Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRONI cc: Richard Shapiro/HOU/EEES@EES, Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES, dwatkiss@bracepatt.com, cingebretson@bracepatt.com, Joe Hillings/Corp/Enron@ENRON, ed@buckham.com, Jeff Brown/HOU/EEES@EES Subject: Re: Stand-alone Reliability Legislation   Joe:   thanks.   Allison is arranging a brief (thirty minutes) Conference Call for sometime tomorrow   so we can assure that we are all on the same page on this issue.   Although we had supported the policy agreement, we had been on record to oppose for political reasons the bill's movement on a stand-alone basis since policing the grid does nothing to address the essential transmission structural changes the market is crying to have addressed in order to provide reliability.

The rates are not much lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates.   The tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into effect by the Supreme Decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down.   The deliverables here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via Supreme Decree that would make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2) file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology.   This second deliverable has now been completed.   Transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that Transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about 5 minutes!   This ruling should also significantly increase Transredes's market value, relative to Enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company.---",
        " Ray Alvarez/NA/Enron on 05/14/20001 111:38 AM ---Doug Farmer05/111/20001 06:09 PMTo: Peter E Weidler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Hansvander.klink@shell.com.br, Hans.h.vanderklink@si.shell.comcc: Jan van den Berg/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, John Naphan/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, Cyro Camacho/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, Pedro Elio/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES, Fernando Gonzalez/TRANSREDES@TRANSREDES Subject: Tariffs ApprovedGentlemen,I am delighted to report that SIRESE approved substantial increases in TR's tariffs consistent with the Law and Regulation.   The details are :-   Existing Tariff SIRESE Approved % Increase TR/CLHB Proposed TR/CLHB % IncreaseGas Export (including surcharges)   $0.18   $0.22205   222.5%   $0.26 (excluding RG)   444.4%Liquids Domestic   $1.05   $2.46   134.3%   $3.25   209.5%Liquids Export   $1.555   $2.31   49%   $3.35   1116.1%CLHB's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19   $2.20   84.9%   $3.528   196.5%As you can see we did substantially better than CLHB (comparable with our liquids domestic) !!!We will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by SIRESE to reach their conclusions on Monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :-1. Export gas volumes increased to 1000% TR capacity, and 1000% GSA + Cuiaba 2 assumed for SDA and TEMIN purposes2. RG Compresion project deleted3. Interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue4. Liquids expansion in the South reduced5. Some continuity of service CAPEX reduced6. Unknown OPEX reduction and maybe a change to the OPEX allocation between concesions7. OCC in service date slipped from 20003 to 20004.8. Debt/Equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30Our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :-1. Volumes.   Covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back here.   Clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term i.e. 20002/20003.2. RG Compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the support of BG3. Interest Rate - We'll get this back when we do a tariff   revision and actual rates are used.   When we get the detail we will appeal if Jan feels we have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited.4. Liquids Expansion in the South.   Here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production will be shut in.   If possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers (PB, BG, Vintage and Chaco).   We will then write to those producers(copy SIRESE , VMEH etc.) stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by SIRESE.   We will give them an estimate of the lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from this decision.   We will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal.5. Continuity of Service Capex.   We need to see the detail here.   We will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards.   We need to see exactly what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services (e.g. LPG transportation) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision.   Again since this is Capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the SIRESE budget process.6. OPEX - need to see the detail on Monday.7. OCC - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an OCC strategy.8. Debt/Equity ratio.   Strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the Law/Regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 40%.   However, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for CAPEX (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 1000% of CAPEX we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 60/40.   We intend to fight this one very hard using all the external/independant help we can get.As you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut.   This has not happened SIRESE has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases.   Having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases.Attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions (i.e. the worst case).Regards,Doug\n"

Co-chaired by Alaska Governor Tony Knowles, IOGCC Chairman and Ohio Governor Bob Taft, with the participation of other governors, this forum promises to be an outstanding exchange of ideas among leaders of government, energy producers, transporters, distributors, and end-users on the subject of the current and long-term outlook for natural gas resources and markets in North America. A very distinguished group of speakers is assembling, including senior government officials and senior executives of companies critically involved in the energy value chain.Primary Goals of the Summit include: * Exploring and clearly communicating the current dynamics of the natural gas market * Informing the industry and the public about the current and future supply potential for gas * Providing governmental and industry leaders with an opportunity to discuss natural gas in the context of national energy policy, with the input of interested State Governors.The Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) and the governors have asked CERA to help organize the Summit and has invited senior CERA staff to moderate panel discussions on the Natural Gas Marketplace and the Supply Response for North America. In addition, I will be providing an opening framework for participants and contributing to the wrap-up of the Summit at the close of the day with the governors.? We are very pleased to be working with the governors and with the IOGCC and its executive director, Christine Hansen.We hope that you can join us for this important event, and encourage you to view the Summit agenda on the IOGCC Web-site at: http:///www.iogcc.state.ok.us/MEETINGS/2000_Governors_Natural_Gas_Summit.htm\n"

I believe there are discussions to consolidate Enron websites and also to develop a Knowledge Management infrastructure.   You and I have shared some thoughts on these subjects. Properly managed, these are potent tools in the strategic mix that would help keep Enron innovative. I know that no concrete plans have yet emerged from your deliberations but I can foresee when you might want someone to lead this effort full time.It is eminently sensible to move towards consolidation in both areas. Among the several benefits, a common infrastructure would sharply reduce both development and maintenance costs.   Also, we would eliminate duplications and give coherence to the look and feel of websites that would emphasize corporate branding.   I am doing some great things here at EBS and generally speaking I am happy. Nevertheless, I see a tremendous potential in this role and very much would like to be considered a prime candidate for the lead position in this effort. Everything I have done here at Enron has richly prepared me for this position. My relationship with business units has given me a unique education.   I have developed information value chain, built and managed three websites in three different operating companies. At all times my products were considered benchmarks. In addition, I shall be able to manage potential political problems that are likely to attend any consolidation. I should be grateful if you would think about this. Once again, thank you for your time.TonyEnron Broadband Services713-853-3939\n"

        " Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 02/15/2000 01:45 PM ---Jose Bestard02/15/2000 01:45 PMTo: Terence H Thorn/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc:   Subject: Re: Trade Mission   Terry. The Key message for the trip, in regards to energy, should be: \"Achieve regional integration, based on the principles of open access, greater reliance on competition and customer choice rather than regulated monopolies\"The vision is that a customer in any of the countries will have choices \"several competing providers\"; \"different service options\", and the providers will have the flexibility and agility to assemble an attractive package by combining transactions   with other suppliers and customers.   This approach maximizes the utilization of the existing infrastructure (reduces idle or redundant facilities) and gives customers the ability to more closely tailor their energy purchases to the their needs.There are barriers to achieve this vision. It is in the interest of the governments to work in a common protocol to progress rapidly.Development of infrastructure .- Still not well developed. Needs to attract project financing. At this stage, the customers have few alternatives. Government policy should be to allow access above and beyond what was initially contracted to justify the financing. Terms of financing have to be honored. Long term, competing facilities (pipelines, refineries, transmission lines, power plants) will be fighting for customers.Threat. Control of these facilities: Petrobras through the BBPL; YPF in Argentina Cross-border Licensing.- Very time consuming, bureaucratic delays to grant, export, import, re-export permitting.   Present regime cannot accommodate   the rapid transaction scenario which will be required to support real integration.Cuiaba Power plant,- As of today we have not received all the permits. Latest issue is the Bolivian-Argentina border dispute due to YPF denial to accommodate a transaction of Bolivian gas into Argentina.Operationally, the plant will receive daily instructions from Brasilia. The gas supply from Argentina/Bolivia, including spot market transaction   has to be nominated within 48 hours notice.   There are no mechanisms to change quickly the approved volumes.Commercial entities need to be given the opportunity to export/import to aggregate the requirements of different suppliers various customers.Taxation.- Transfer taxes (i.e. receipt taxes ,stamp taxes) for each step down the chain needs to be eliminated for commercial entities, particularly for export transactions.These commercial entities buy pieces of the services on behalf of the ultimate customer (act as their agent) and package the final offer. The objective to   reduce the cost of the product, which would not be met by adding a further taxable event. There should not be   more, nor any less taxes because of the services of the middle company, except for the larger amount of income taxes generated by increase commercial activity.Money Transfers.-   Central Bank Controls to authorize the transfer of currency needs to be made more agile. Currently these procedures are very time consuming and cumbersome (Brazil --- I am not as familiar with the other countries)This is affecting us in Cuiaba. The Central Bank has not approved the gas contract, specifically the Take-or-pay provision that has a one-year make up period. They want a longer make-up period, but that was negotiated with YPF as part of the larger agreement. YPF may agree but at a higher price. The Central Bank does not want to send US$ out of the country, so they view TOP as a devise of paying for a commodity never received. So they are meddling in contract negotiations. Below are other notesThanksJoseTerence H Thorn02/09/2000 09:222 AMTo: Jose Bestard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Richard Shapiro@EES Subject: Trade MissionI have forwarded to you the final schedule of meetings for Daly's trade mission.   I am very comfortable with issues for Argentina and think we need to focus mainly on the stamp tax issue.   Secondly, I would raise the issue of open access pipelines, especially allowing Bolivian gas to flow to Argentina.   The question I have on this latter issue is whether this is a matter of changing the law, changing policy or pressuring YPF to allow the gas to flow on it's section of pipe which I understand is not under the jurisdiction of Enargas. What can the government do?JB.- I am not familiar with the genesis of this situation, how these pipelines escaped the jurisdiction of the regulator.   If it is determined that they are not part of the regulated pipeline network, in time a bypass pipeline may be built. But an immediate solution needs to be developed.In Brazil, I am not sure what to raise.   On Monday we have meetings with the Minister of Development, Industry and Commerce and the Secretary of Energy and Mines.   What do I need to have Daly raise with them in private?   Myself in public? or the Minister of External Affairs?JB.- For background, the Brazilians have rising concerns of the rising dollarization of their economy, \"desnacionaliza?ao\". Their concern is not the US$, it is control. It is that the Old-boys network in Brazil Government/Industry, has been disturbed by the New-boys taking control of high visibility sectors, Banking, telecommunications, energy.   Malan, Finance is criticized by the clique that wants the government to be active in direct investment and support of big projects.Complaints about BNDES (Brazilian development bank) lending to foreigners for privatization (Recent AES incident)Tourinho, Mines and Energy--- pushing a new privatization model --- sale of stock at the market, not sale of control to a given company. This allows the existing management to stay in place. If it is the Secretary of Energy, Carraro, his big mission is to coordinate the developement of emergengy thermal plants. Big Picture Governement Porgram --- Petrobras provides that gas;   Eletrobras buys and remarkets the electric energy;   BNDES provides the financing   --- All within the family.Foreign companies will not play by the rules of the old network. Enron has been actively complaining about the gas policy under Petrobras control.The One Issue I would raise is the lack of competition in the gas sector. Petrobras control of the BBPL and national gas. There cannot be true competition in the energy sector because the marginal power plants, price setters, gas power plants.As a note, there was a commitment with the World Bank to sell the part of 51% control of the Brazilian part of the BBPL pipeline. What Petrobras is doing is locking-up the capacity long term, and building a second pipeline.Of equal importance is our meeting with the Sao Paulo Governor.   What issues do we have or what do you want me to say to him regarding our assets in this area.   Even if it's to compliment on something, that's fine.JB.- The State of Sao Paulo, Mario Covas team are to be congratulated by the skillful manner that they have conducted the gradual privatization of energy sector.   Covas is very influential. His current battle deals with tax reforms in Brazil. He is fighting a system of tax-preferences in other states to attract industries, which ultimately creates a Federal burden and consequently a Sao Paulo burden.The Petrobras control issue of the gas sector should have resonance.I assume we have no key issues in Chile at this time.   JB.- There may be some but I a blissfully unaware of them. I would be interested on what you pick upThanks.---",

GAZETA: Energia , o alvo dos empres?rios americanos???BRAS?LIA, 15 de fevereiro de 2000 - Empres?rios norte-americanos que ?acompanharam o secret?rio de Com,rcio, William Daley, destacaram o setor de ?energia ?no Brasil como a principal ?rea para investimentos no Pa?s. Segundo o ?vice-presidente da Enron, Terrence Thorn, por,m, 'o monop?lio exercido pela ?Petrobras? tem que acabar para que o setor se desenvolva. Todos devem competir, ?inclusive a estatal'.?Um dos obst?culos ,,, de acordo com ele, 'a sombra que a Petrobras faz sobre o ?mercado de energia no Brasil'. O executivo norte-americano lembra que a ?decis?o do governo brasileiro de estabelecer um pre?o ?nico para o g?s ?natural em todo o pa?s , um claro exemplo de medidas que devem ter seus dias ?contados. 'Ficamos confusos ao saber de tal decis?o'. Terrence Thorn acredita ?que um monop?lio estatal pode ser negativo . concorrncia e que a privatiza???o da Petrobras ter? que ocorrer um dia.Para ele, o processo de privatiza???o de energia no Brasil vem sendo conduzido de forma eficaz, 'mas o Pa?s ainda n?o concluiu o projeto de desregulamenta???o (liberalizar o pre?o do g?s natural, por exemplo) e h? muito trabalho pela frente'. Segundo Thorn, as empresas estrangeiras de energia podem oferecer servi?os inovadores para o setor.'O problema , que o mercado n?o est? preparado'. Ele defende que as novas fases da desregulamenta???o do setor energ,tico no Pa?s sejam debatidas por toda a sociedade.O interesse dos norte-americanos pelo setor p\"de ser visto na pr?pria composi???o da miss?o de empres?rios ao Brasil. Das 20 empresas que viajaram com Daley, dez eram do setor de energia. O representante da Agncia de ?Desenvolvimento e Com,rcio dos Estados Unidos (USTR), Albert Angulo, ainda ?informou? que o ?rg?o est? analisando cinco oportunidades de investimentos dos EUA no ?mercado de energia do Brasil. 'Realizamos estudos de viabilidade para que? empresa venham ao Pa?s, mas o certo , que uma maior desregulamenta???o do ?setor energ,tico seria muito positivo para as empresas norte-americanas', diz.?A vice-presidente da empresa Energy Conversion Devices, Nancy Bacon, defende ?que o governo brasileiro deixe de gastar recursos com a gera???o de energia ?em locais distantes e passe a comprar tecnologias alternativas dos ?norte-americanos.

      "body": "\nTerry was acting with full coordination from Jose.   The problem was this: Daly insisted someone speak on behalf of the group to the press (and designated Terry to be the one); Terry did not have the updated information that we were about to meet with the government officials and deliver a slightly different message (i.e. that we needed to know if the government planned to really open Petrobras or not --- the implication being that we would work within either decision but we needed to know one way or the other); Terry was simply not in possession of this information and no one had given it to him (probably because they had no reason to assume that Terry would be thrust in front of the press); moreover, it's hard to see how Terry could have taken such a position publicly anyway.   By my eyes Terry did the best he could and we had an unavoidable communications bust.

Report was completed, submitted tothe governor and released on August 2.On July 27, 2000, Governor Davis called on federal and state regulators totake swift action to extend the caps on wholesale electric rates inCalifornia and provide San Diego ratepayers with million of dollars inrefunds.In letters written by the governor to two state regulatory agencies and twoCalifornia-based panels charged with overseeing California's power market,he called for a coordinated state effort to urge federal regulators to takestrong measures to reduce power rates in both the short- and long-term.On August 2, 2000, Governor Davis issued three Executive Orders designed toreduce energy consumption by state government and speed up the time it takesnew power generating facilities to win approval from state agencies.On August 9, 2000, Governor Davis called on the Public Utilities Commission(PUC) to establish a two-year plan that would cut electricity rates bynearly half for residential and business customers of San Diego Gas &amp;Electric.The governor also reached an agreement with the California GrocersAssociation that will save enough electricity to provide power to between50,000 and 60,000 homes during periods of peak demand, as grocers agreed toreduce power consumption by 10 percent during Stage One emergencies.On August 10, 2000, Governor Davis wrote a letter to President Clintonurging him to expedite FERC's investigation to determine whether currentelectric rates in San Diego were unjust.On August 222, 2000, Governor Davis called on President Clinton to releaseemergency funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)to the state to help low-income Californians pay their rapidly-risingelectricity bills.On August 23, 2000, President Clinton responded to Governor Davis' requestby releasing $2.6 million in emergency funds to help low-income SouthernCalifornians cope with the surge in their electricity bills. The Presidentalso asked federal regulators to speed up their investigation into theoperation of U.S. power markets and urged the Small Business Administrationto use its credit programs to help small firms hurt by the price increases.On August 23, 2000, Governor Davis reached agreement with legislators onlegislation to provide relief to San Diego ratepayers. The governor signedtwo bills into law on September 6, 2000.Please see attached letter (below).# # #SEPTEMBER 12, 2000STATEMENT OF GOVERNOR GRAY DAVISTO THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION CONCERNING ITS INVESTIGATION OFWHOLESALE PRICE ESCALATION IN CALIFORNIAThe Summer of 2000 has confronted California with an electricity crisis thatseriously threatens the safety, health and well being of citizens andbusinesses throughout the state. At the heart of the crisis is theextraordinary run up in prices for wholesale electric energy and ancillaryservices, accompanied by deteriorating service and reliability. In SanDiego, electric customers' bills have more than doubled this summer,threatening permanent harm to businesses and the health and welfare ofresidential customers in the warm southern climate. All remaining Californiaelectric consumers are faced with similar prospects as their legislated ratefreeze periods come to an end. In San Francisco we saw rolling blackouts forthe first time in our history.As soon as the dimensions of the crisis became evident, I directedCalifornia regulators, including the Public Utilities Commission and theElectricity Oversight Board, and the Independent System Operator, to takeimmediate steps to identify and implement specific measures to mitigate thedamage, including restoring price caps at Summer 1999 levels. I am happy toreport that those measures have been adopted, although not withoutconsiderable resistance from self-interested parties.In recent weeks, I have worked with the California Legislature to enactfurther relief within the existing framework of options now available to thestate. These include provisions to stabilize retail rates, expeditegeneration licensing where possible, implement targeted demand reduction anddemand response and remove constraints in transmission and distributionsystems. I have also established a task force comprised of key stateofficials which is developing measures to increase energy efficiency andalternative supplies and to expedite permitting by state agencies.While these actions should provide short-term rate predictability andlonger-term benefits to customers in terms of improved supplies, thefundamental problem of exorbitant wholesale prices still exists and remainsthe responsibility of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to address.No combination of state actions can substitute for federal action toameliorate the problems in California's wholesale markets.A joint report submitted to me on August 2nd by the Chairman of theCalifornia Electricity Oversight Board and the President of the CaliforniaPublic Utilities Commission concluded that exorbitant wholesale prices inCalifornia result from wholesale market dysfunction and the exercise ofmarket power by sellers. Subsequent reports by the Market AnalysisDepartment and the Market Surveillance Committee of the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator reach the same conclusions. Subsequent behaviorof wholesale electric prices during August confirms their conclusions, andsubjects California to further economic damage. While I remain hopeful thatCalifornia wholesale markets may ultimately become competitive and becomecapable of serving the interests of consumers and the public, I cannot andwill not accept the liabilities to California that result from the currentsituation for even a short period. I intend to take any and all stepsnecessary to restore economic stability to the electric serviceinfrastructure of California.FERC bears the responsibility under its organic act to assure just andreasonable wholesale electric rates. FERC bears responsibility to ensurethat a workably competitive market exists before California consumers andCalifornia's economy are subjected to unconstrained, market-basedelectricity prices. Consequently, I renew my prior request that theCommission act with utmost speed to intervene to the fullest extent possibleto restore wholesale prices to fair levels and to remedy harms that haveresulted from the exercise of market power.###OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR---A000:245FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASESeptember 12, 2000GOVERNOR DAVIS NAMES KAHN CHAIR OF THE GOVERNOR'S CLEAN ENERGY GREEN TEAMSACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today announced the appointment of MichaelA.

A representative from the White House transition team joined the conversation.   I was asked the terms under which we were prepared to negotiate and I told them at a minimum upon a commitment by the Indian authorities to serious negotiations which would include full compliance with the terms of the contracts and progress in the reform of the MSEB.   I made clear that we do not see the Godbole Committee as the basis for such a discussion. I think the USG wants to be on record politically encouraging the Indian Govt. to engage in discussions all parties consider to be meaningful in hopes of working things out before it is too late, even while through OPIC and EXIM it is supporting the move towards PNT.   The administration may be concerned that without such a diplomatic overture on its part it could be concluded that the USG has politically taken a position on the project. In Trakya, for example, the USG has been quite proactive in pressing the Turkish govt on the payments issue and even in discussing the payment concerns with the IMF so that the payments issues for the BOTs (two of the four in Turkey are US sponsored) are taken into account as the IMF program moves forward. So I anticipate that the USG will shortly be meeting with the Indian ambassador here and the US Charge in Delhiwill likely be directed to make the rounds and meet with senior government officals on the project. I wanted you to be aware of this; also any guidance you can provide would be helpful.   Thanks John   \n"

The \"Who wants to help Millions\" game begins next Wed. (7/19) via email.   I think Steve could encourage participation from his group with an email sent out Tues. 7/18 similar to this:Subject:   Millionaire Game!Want to have fun?   Want to get on a game show?   Want to help Millions?   Tomorrow you will receive an email that allows you to answer 15 questions via email responses (about United Way, Enron, and other fun items).   Participation with correct answers puts you in the drawing for the employees to represent Corp. in a \"Who wants to be a Millionaire?\" game that will be played to benefit United Way on August 9.   The lucky and smart representatives will be playing for great prizes.   I encourage your participation in the game, but more importantly, encourage your generous participation in Enron's United Way campaign.   Thanks for your help and HAVE FUN!Other items:Corp. will be sponsoring DePelchin Children's Center through Day of Caring and other activites during the year.   Other Enron business units will choose other UW agencies to sponsor through activities.   We need to provide promotions/prizes for our group during the campaign.   Do we have Enron Field tickets, dinner at Ruggles at Enron Field, use of Steve's car, etc. that we could use for drawings a couple days after the kick off on August 9?   We could send emails to Steve's group encouraging them to get their pledge cards (now online) in early and draw from the early participants.\n"

During this two week period Dale has been asked to obtain stakeholder input into ways to address concerns about whether the spot price in the Alberta Power Pool is a product of interaction among competitiors in a efficient market.   In our discussions with the Power Pool and ADRD today and yesterday Enron expressed its willingness to work with the Power Pool to provide feedback on suggested rule changes but has also made it clear that we do not agree with the premise that there is a \"problem\" that requires \"emergency\" amendments to the Pool rules.   Our position has been that Alberta is short supply, and significant changes to the rules and/or market design will only discourage new generation development. Dale McMaster had just left the Power Pool Council meeting when he called and had not yet put much thought into how to define the issue he has to address and what the process will be.   We discussed the process and it appears he will likely receive comments from stakeholders at large and also assemble a small committee of 4-5 stakeholders (which would include Enron) to work with the Power Pool to consider possible changes to the Pool rules.   Dale said he would try to pull together a \"terms of reference\" document that would define the mandate of the small committee by tomorrow.After my call with Dale McMaster, Peter Keohane and I spoke to Aleck Trawick and we have asked Blakes to assist us in three areas:1) Once the terms of reference of this small committee are released (and assuming Enron is asked to participate on the committee) Blakes will assist us with preparing a letter that states that Enron's participation does not represent acknowledgement or agreement that the Power Pool Rules must be amended to address the concerns of some stakeholders about real time pricing in Alberta and that Enron's participation on the committee is on a without prejudice basis;2) Enron needs to obtain the final memo from Frontier Economics in which Frontier provides its opinion on how the proposed rule changes: i) would introduce price discrimination into the Alberta electricity market, ii) would be contrary to the development of an efficient, fair and openly competitive market for electricity, ii) would compromise the independence of the Power Pool, and iv) would have the expected effect of artificially depressing the real time price of electricity in Alberta.   Once Blakes receives a copy of the Frontier Economics memo, they will prepare a memo for Enron advising: i) whether the two week process of consultation by the Power Pool is in accordance with the standards required of the PPC as an administrative tribunal operating in Alberta; and ii) whether such rule changes offend the provisions of the EUA;3) Blakes will advise Enron of the possible avenues of recourse (i.e. appeal to the AEUB, and/or legal action in the Court of Queen's Bench) in the event the proposed rule changes (or similar changes) are approved by the PPC at the end of this two week period.   GPC and Eric Thode will also be consulted on this issue and obviously input from all those within Enron working on this project will be sought prior to any decision being made to pursue any possible legal remedies.   Please advise if you have any comments.Regards,Rob \n"

The legal arguments are one piece of our 5 point action plan (it relates to action items 2,3, and 4) that I outlined in my November 13 e-mail to the group.   Action item #1 (and I agree this must be our primary focus) is to communicate to the Alberta Government: i) Enron's views on what mistakes are being made by governments in other jurisdictions in response to high price levels,   and ii) Enron's plans for Alberta if the Alberta Government \"stays the course\" and does not interfere in the market.   We are hopeful this can be done through Milnthorp and Delainey meeting with Premier Klein and/or Minister Cardinal.   If such a meeting isn't possible we will simply have to get the message through to them via lower level officials in the Alberta Government. On Tuesday Rob Milnthorp left messages for Premier Klein, the Premier's Chief of Staff, and Minister Cardinal, and the Cardinal's Deputy Minister, Ken Smith.   I also spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD.   The speaking points that we prepared to guide us through these calls are as follows:Enron understands that electricity prices in Alberta are an important issue for the GovernmentEnron has concerns with a number of recent rule and market design developments in the electricity market Enron feel that it would be helpful for the President and CEO of Enron North America and Rob M to sit down for a brief meeting with the Premier and Minister Cardinal to: 1)   Explain Enron's current plans to expand commercial operations in both the electricity and natural gas sectors;2) Express Enron's concerns that the Alberta electricity market \"may not indeed be open for business\" given recent developments, including:   (i) The MAP and its adverse effect on the PPA Buyers and the \"no harm\" commitment;(ii) Power Pool rule changes of the sort recently proposed will irreparably damage existing suppliers such as Enron, the ultimate effect of which will undoubtedly be the lack of development of much needed new supply and longer term high prices for consumers.   3) Express Enron's willingness to draw on our experience in other markets and explain our vision of how the Government can work through this difficult period in the shortest possible time frame.Ken Smith returned Milnthorp's call this morning and Rob Milnthorp advised that he covered each of the above speaking points and the conversation went very well.   Smith asked him \"what would you do if you were us?\" and Rob replied that the Government must stay the course as the alternatives will make the situation worse.   Rob also told Smith that Enron's preference is to continue to work with the Government on these difficult issues and Enron \"doesn't like sending letters that threaten legal action to the Government or the Power Pool\", especially since we share a common vision on electricity restructuring with the Alberta Government.   Smith indicated that with the Alberta Legislature back in session it would be difficult to get a meeting for us with the Premier but he would try to do so and would get back to Milnthorp.   Whether we get a meeting with the Premier, or not, we still need to prepare a new briefing note for the government within the next week and at the very least Rob Milnthorp and I can meet with Larry Charach and Ken Smith to walk them through this document.   As you say, our document must focus on \"the adverse effect on consumers\" and the implications of the Government moving off the strategy it continues to publicly support (the Premier said again this week in question period that the problem is that we are short supply) which is to \"allow the market to work\".

We developed a 5 point action plan to deal with the proposed Power Pool rule changes that would have a significant impact on the value of Enron's PPA investment in Alberta.   By way of update to Steve, you may wish to brief him that: 1) It appears the Power Pool will not proceed with the rule change designed to exclude importers from setting pool price.   They will proceed with dispatch risk rule changes but we have given input on those too and I am optimistic that Enron will be able to live with these rule changes, the final wording of which we should see on Monday, 2) We   have set up a meeting with the Minister of Resource Development (you, Rob Milnthorp and I will attend) on December 111 to encourage the Alberta Government to stay the course, and 3) This week we will finalize our \"Lessons from other Jurisdictions\" document (that Steve sent me materials to include in) and will provide it to the Alberta Government and Power Pool and then follow up with them.   ---",

Governor Davis refused to come to California, so a video conference was set up with two locations:   one at DOE in Washington and one in Los Angeles for the Governor and his entourage.   It was tentatively set up for 2:30 pm CST.   I have had no reports on the meeting yet. Ken Lay, Steve Kean and Rick Shapiro attended for Enron.Long-Term Forward ContractsGood progress was made and the report was completed by 4 pm.   It includes a draft RFO, draft standard contract, a table of utilties' needs, products required and a timetable that would have power flowing by February 1.Participants were fairly pessimistic about the eventual outcome, however, given the absence of any buy-in or participation by the State of California.Debt and ForebearanceGroup also worked to have draft documents completed by COB Friday.QF Contract ReformationParties continued discussionNo information was available by COB Friday.Major IssuesState interest in resolvingState willingness to raise retail ratesUtilties' desire to offload all risk to the State as its portfolio managerWillingness to \"call off the dogs\" for the suppliers and to release them from legal actionState willingness to offer up sites for power plant developmentAbility to reach deal on QF contract reformationNext StepsIf definitive agreement is not reached by the principals at Saturday meeting, this work ends immediately and utilities will likely file for bankruptcy the week of Jan 15.If agreement is reached, a massive amount of work is required immediately, such as:FERC filing of settlement and ISO Tariff change by Tuesday Jan 16.RFO completion and release by Jan 18Introduction and passage of necessary legislation to be executed by February 2.Preparation of contract between utilities and state (probably DWR)Preparation of formal agreements among the parties on the terms on this settlementAnd more...\n"

The first time through is the   hardest and slowest.   After we have run all the traps once, the subsequent requests move faster.   But we have to get it right.   Even in Europe, where our contributions were small and routine, we attracted a bunch of attention just because of who we are (as in Japan Enron attracts alot of attention in Europe --- even where other American companies don't).\tNicholas O'Day\t12/04/2000 07:12 PM \t\t\t To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: Joseph P Hirl/AP/ENRON@ENRON\t\t\t Subject: Urgent - political functionSteve, the purpose of this note is to get your sign off on attending a cocktail function to be held by a senior Japanese political figure this evening. Timing for approval is at issue.We have been invited by Mr Kamei a senior political figure in the LDP to attend a cocktail party this evening. The price is Y20,000 (about $190) per head and we were proposing to send two people. My rough estimate is that half of each ticket would go to the LDP ie a total of $190. We have been developing a good relationship with the LDP through Kamei and most recently, he assisted us in arranging a meeting for Ken Lay with the MITI minister. Accordingly the purpose of attending is to maintain good relations with the Japanese Government with a view assisting to further Enron Japan's business interests in Japan. It would be viewed negatively if we were not to attend.   We have external legal counsel sign-off that this type of function is legal in Japan. The function also has the support of Joe Hirl. I am aware that there is a procedure for political donations, however, given the number of Enron hands that the application needs to pass through, we will not have approval in time for this evening. Hence this note.Through the course of today, I will seek to get the application approved through Mark Schroeder and John Sherriff and on its way to   Elizabeth Labanowski and then to you. As mentioned, Elizabeth is unlikely to get the application until after the function this evening. In the meantime, I would be grateful if you read this email this evening if I could have your preliminary OK.kind regards\n"

If that's \"doable\", I'd love to talk more.   Let me know your availability next week.Terrie   \tFrom:   David Mims @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS   02/111/2000 03:57 PM To: Bill Donovan/EPSC/HOU/ECT@ECT@ENRONcc: Elizabeth Tilney/HOU/EEES@EES@ECT@ENRON, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Pam Benson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ECT@ENRON, Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES@ECT@ENRON, Terrie James/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Video Screens in EB Elevator Cabs   I have arranged a tentative agreement with Bowne Business Solutions (13th floor graphics) to provide content digitization, encoding and storage for video productions.   They will have the capability to output from S-VHS, Beta SP and electronic sources, along with minimal editing and creation of basic multimedia images suitable for the Enron channel.   Additional costs would be incurred by individual departments incrementally as they produced video content for the monitors.   Enron would then have a choice of vendors, including the in-house graphics group, Innovision (Beth Stier) and others.We also need to determine the point of demarcation for the \"head-end\" of the video signal for these and any other building monitors.   I don't know if your estimates include any of this head-end equipment which would include VTRs, modulators, distribution amplifiers, CATV contracts and receivers, satellite, etc.   Regardless, we need to talk to the folks who will be producing content for these monitors to see what types of capabilities they want to have.Finally, someone will have to \"own\" the channel and pre-approve content for distribution.   I'm pretty certain that Mark Palmer wants to control the content, though I don't think that he wants to manage the production group, or create any overkill.I'd be happy to discuss alternatives with all of you for the content side of this project.   Again, I think that the costs will be incremental expenses related to creating content rather than capital outlay.Beth, Mark, Pam, Setev, Terrie, et al. - Are you interested in addressing what in-house capabilities you'd like to have with me?DMMTo: Elizabeth Tilney/HOU/EEES@EES, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Pam Benson/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, David Mims/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EES, Terrie James/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Video Screens in EB Elevator CabsBeth, Mark - I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14\" monitors per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.   Will try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, attractive look.   Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.   such that   we know total costs are below $5000K (more in $350-4000K range plus whatever temporary, non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).   We have a 3 month implementation schedule.Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc.Let me know next steps.   We can discuss funding sources.   - Bill\n"

Any suggestions on anyone we might retain if this becomes a big \"government to government\" issue?\tJohn Hardy@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT\t01/26/20001 03:000 PM \t\t\t To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Washington Actions re DabholSteve With regard to Dabhol, Tom Briggs and I have already provided a status briefing on the Dabhol situation to agencies across the government - including DoEnergy, DOCommerce,DOState and DOTreasury.   The briefing was with staff and brought them up to speed on where we stand.   As the new administration moves into the positions relevant to the situation we will brief them - all the way up to the cabinet officals.   I understand that Colin Powell has already been briefed on the situation   and I know the Ambassador has been front and center on the issue. If we were to move into a crisis mode, we will need to brief senior officals of the new administration at each of the   above agencies as well as the VP's office.   Given their interest I think we will be able to do that quickly. We have also briefed OPIC and EXIM about the situation - they are comfortable at this point. I am also getting the World Bank re-engaged to the extent that it is helpful and not a problem.   They have resources that can help MSEB reform themselves if MSEB will view it has a help.   It is a sensitive issue because the Bank has historically been anti-Dabhol so I am taking it step by step. If you have any other questions just let me know.   thanks John \n"

Here are notes for your staff meeting.Buyer/Seller have executed Offer Letter on Falcon EX ($32,750,000 price).   Aircraft goes to pre-purchase inspection this weekend.   Close is no later than June 6th.   All indications are that buyer is very motivated to complete the deal.Enron Center South (ECS) Project remains solidly on track.   We are 10 weeks out on initial occupancy with Level 3 occupancy (EGM moves Aug. 3rd).   Levels 4 (EIM, ENW, &amp; Credit.Com) occupies two weeks later (Aug. 17).   Level 5 (Power) occupies two weeks after (Aug. 31st   - Labor Day weekend).   Level 6 (Gas) occupies two weeks after (Sept. 14th).   Level 7 (Executive) and the 1st floor public spaces occupies year end.   Level 2 (Cafeteria) opens Nov.Found a Law firm interested in Azurix's present space in Three Allen Center (3 floors).   Goal is cut deal and have them in by year end.Enron Broadband indicates an intent to remain on their present ECN floors (Levels 444 and 45), plus backfill balance of operations into Wholesale's vacated trading floors.   This splits them into two elevator banks and becomes problematic for ETS - who wants continuous floors, ECN Levels 39 through 46.We are seeking subtenants for Broadband's Portland office space.   They plan to vacate the Riverplace building by Oct. Negotiating new food service contract with Sedexo Marriott to add ECS cafeteria.   Total compensation will be based on 3% fee on gross revenue - only on individual sales of $2 or more (promote greater # of meals served) and bonus based on sharing of net operating income with Enron.   Global Sourcing is participating with us in negotiations.Need to decide if Executive Car Care program is going to be continued (30 executives participate with employee paying $70 per month and business units subsidizing $275 per month).   Decision needed because new Garage will require $60K in improvements to get set up for car washing.   Present lease on remote car washing facility (@ $5k per month) expired and we are on month to month holdover.We are two weeks out to close on Beltway 8 land deal ($1.7 purchase price).   Real estate being acquired for construction of new $18 mill. Data Center and Disaster Recovery Facility.   Phillipe and I meet with Frevert next week to get approvals.- Bill\n"

Should I be putting Steve Kean on these email updates?As you all know, there were several governors events over the past 3 to 4 days in Washington DC:Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringer's office.   They would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could participate in an Energy council that is being formed (actually commissioned by the legislature) to study energy issues for the state.   Geringer would also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an assets based to a market based entity.   We had contacted Scott Cealy (spelling) with Arizona Governor Hull's office last week and   Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and had a chance to thank her for her   leadership in opposing price caps. Mr. Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to see them. I will schedule that meeting (boy that Paul must have been charming at dinner!!!)I sat with Gary Smith, political guy with Gov Kempthorne's office who indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on Tuesday afternoon.   Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting with Cheney, but there was speculation that he may not come.   I have not confirmed the outcome of that meeting, but was invited by Mr. Smith to call him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow.   I will place that call and see what I can find out.   Mr. Racicot was going to get back to us on what he found out from Kempthorne---has Linda or Rick heard from him?   I will be continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to him.We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March 30 that Governor Owens is sponsoring.   Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens staff.   As most of you know from previous updates, Owens is strong in his support against price caps and market based solutions.At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber.   Linda---how do we want to follow up on that request?Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door open to future discussions.   Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for now.We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt.   I will continue to work on setting that up.   Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock on that door.   We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some commercial reasons.There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info, etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights. \n"

I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received this morning at the White House energy \"messaging\" meeting.   These are very close hold.   Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone.   Ed asked us to give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be giving them comments).   After glancing at the TPs, the obvious missing point is open access.   However, I am not sure we should be alarmed about that.   There really isn't any policy in the TPs.   This is a typical WH message document.   Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access.   Also, Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House outreach effort.   Any thoughts? 2.   I am faxing to you EPSA's summary of the generators meeting with Secretary Abraham.   I am glad I did not attend this meeting.   As you will see from the summary, there were three parts to the meeting:   a) an exchange of policy views, both long and short term, b) discussion of how to maximize generator output in Calif; and c) a request that industry participate in a DOE reliability group.   I don't see any follow up for Enron, outside of our normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials.   Let me know if you have additional thoughts.   \n"

Specifically I think we should determine a fair market value for the PR we received from the event overall and I would like to transfer pay that amount from Corp to EBS.   I know that sounds a little agressive but if you think about it the analysts are very focused on EBS's streaming revenue, which has been tough to come by.   Also it really is a net zero dollar amount to Enron at the end of the day but hopefully value creating to the stock price.   Hope this is not a problem.---",

I have summarized the main visibility we received.   There were several more \"freebies\" in the end, but they are not accounted for in the following:We had a total of 40 thirty-second commercials that ran on NBC and TNT (the Turner Network). We also had 8-10 billboards which said \"This portion of Wimbledon was brought to you by Enron, a leading energy and broadband services company.\" The broadcaster who announced the match also gave us plugs by saying, \"Watch this on the net at ww.wimbledon.net, streamed by Enron.\" There was a banner floating across the bottom of the page saying that as well.Additionally we received ad time and billboards on ESPN, CNNsi and several other networks.   We had banners streaming on up to 10 websites, including ww.msnbc.com, ww.cnnsi.com and ww.wimbledon.net.   There was also a static banner on the Wimbledon Channel, no matter which site you watched it on (Wimbledon, CNNsi or MSNBC).   All the banners took you to a jump page we created, located at ww.enron.net/wimbledon. At Wimbledon we had 12 courtside seats and 24 grounds passes.   I was also told that we had a small paid contract with FastTV.com to stream the archived site. We released a press release on our services with IBM, IMG, TWII and Wimbledon several days into the event; and EBS sent out an email to top clients/potential clients directing them to the site.   Business Week is also releasing a profile on Enron in their upcoming eBiz section, which features the Wimbledon Club as a customer. Please let me know if you have any questions I can answer.   Have a great day, Margaret\n"

For the speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of energy development.   Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the commission is charged with the development and promotion of such.   But the Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters in the traditional sense.   We will continue to have the status of a colony if we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are evolving.   If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role in this evolution.   I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a short Qand A period.   But your message can be as succint as you can make it and get the point across.   You may have to present the Enron case a number of different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point.   You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address role playing by the state and the commission.   Plan to join us for lunch.   If you need more detail, let me know.   Thanks!   Stephen\n"

We're also looking to increase your exposure with employees.   We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a couple of weeks ago.   It's called \"Jeff's Corner\" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet --- which can be accessed by 999.9% of our employees.   This is how it will work.   We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking about what's top of mind at that moment.   The tone and style will be like your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and conversational.   We suggest the first topic be \"The State of Enron.\"   There is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about the widespread re-deployment efforts.   These recent events are   beginning to affect morale.   Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year.   You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force.   Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost.   We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly.   The nice thing about this medium is we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you speak to employees gives the message credibility.   Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc.   We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to discuss.I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this now.   I will check your calendar with Sherri.   Let me know if you have any questions.Mary\n"

I still think it's important for our security people to be able to recognize all of our senior executives and make sure their guests get where they are going quickly.To: Steven J Kean/HOU/EEES@EEScc: Susan Skarness/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Follow-upSteve - Following up on our conversation Friday, we have advised Cliff Baxter's Assistant that effective immediately Cliff and his quests can pass through Security on the Plaza, without showing his access card or requiring his quests to sign in or identify themselves.   All he needs to do is approach the front Reception Desks and asking for entry.   The receptionists will recognise Cliff by sight and ensure that he and his quests pass through - without delay - by lifting the adjacent rope.We are asking Cliff to use his badge at the card readers, as per standard procedure, when he is entering the building by himself.We are also refining procedures and upgrading our IT systems/data base @ the Reception Desk, to make it easier on a visitor of any employee.   For example if you call down to the Plaza Reception Desk and advise that a visitor is expected, the receptionist will have a pass prepared so as to eliminate the sign in process.   The guest simply has to exchange their business card for the visitor pass.   Or if an employee shows their access card at the Reception Desk and asks that their guest gain entry, that guest can get a badge without signing in.   Again, we ask that the guest exchange their business card for a visitor pass.We are   working on installing a new data base @ the Desk that will pull up a digitised photo of the employee (duplicate of what's on their badge) on the screen.   This will allow employees to get a temporary access badge without showing other ID and will speed process.Finally, we are testing a small proximity access card which is designed to be a duplicate back-up for executives.   It is sized to fit on a key chain and works with our standard card readers.- Bill   \n"

As he is on sabbatical from Washington University, he will have no teaching requirements of us but has offered to give some talks around and about for us.Since Ken Lay once worked for Murray when Murray was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, I wondered if Enron might be interested in jointly sponsoring a breakfast or luncheon talk by Murray sometime after the first of the year. He is giving a major address to the Detroit Economic Club in Janurary and I suspect that he will have the basis for a great talk in Houston as well.In any event because of the title he will hold and because of our many joint ventures, I wanted to begin the process of finding a partner in this endeavor.Let me know what you think.gil\n"

Please let us know which of these options (or a derivative therein) you'd prefer.   For continuity through the year-end process, we might consider having the existing MD VP PRC Committee review the VP slate; and   the former EC and two newly appointed EC members   who are also VP PRC Committee, (John   Lavorato and Jeff Shankman were suggested), ratify the VP slate and review the MD's.   The newly appointed EC members who are MD level will remain in the \"Not Rated\" category, so that Jeff and John may participate in the overall discussion and depart before discussions relative to them and their EC colleagues.   Alternatively, we might disband the existing MD VP PRC Committee in favor of having the newly appointed EC   (13   of whom are MD VP PRC) review the VP slate.   Thereafter, the Enron Corporate Policy Committee would be responsible for ratifying these results and for reviewing the MD's slate.   Insofar as the Policy Committee might require further   information on individual MD's, selected EC members could be invited for an appropriate period of time to provide the necessary details.   If we opt to disband the existing MD VP PRC we'd need to notify those members who aren't part of the new EC that their services are no longer required.   In so much as some of these people are currently assigned to, and attending, BU and functional pre-rankings clearly the sooner we are able to do this, the better.Your immediate attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated, since we are eager to begin the year-end VP/MD PRC planning process.

I have had a rethink and believe that as a matter of courtesy (Japanese style), it would be preferable in the first instance if the contact with Mr Okuda is done from chairman to chairman. Mr Lay's letter will serve as an introduction to Jeff Skilling, and will also permit Enron Japan to follow up directly with Mr Okuda's staff in Japan. We can then draft a letter for Jeff Skilling to confirm arrangements.I attach a draft letter for that purpose.

This program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost a lot of momentum over the last two years.In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't   in its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been addressing.   The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams are not lending support to the program.   I'd be very happy to spend a few minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.   You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has gotten me to my rope's end with the program.\n"

I still pressed for a one on one meeting on May 3 in Sacramento, but she told me the Governor wanted to have the one meeting all at once and his schedule was very tight on Thursday, May 3.   I transferred her to Sherri and called Ken.   Ken wanted me to try to get more specific information, which she shared that it is with generators - Sempra, Williams, CalPine, Duke, Dynegy, and Reliant.   She also said since the Governor has worked with Ken, she thought he might prefer that he attend.   Ken said to let you all know and be thinking whether we even want to do it.

I have had twolong-standing academic projects: one was due 4/19 (it was on \"final review\"- a paper about corporate political strategy - and just was accepted forpublication at our top academic journal) and another is due 5/31. The 5/31paper was commissioned long ago but is a key paper in a June conference(topic is methods to study corporate political activities and the publicaffairs function). In order to get it done properly, I need to forego anywork at Enron until later in the month.A project of interest to me at Enron - and I hope one that you also haveinterest - is assessing the effectiveness of governmental affairs. Johntold me that he conducted such a study for the group last year. One of themethodological challenges is to calculate the benefits that governmentaffairs brings - especially in a system where, for example, on thelegislative side, much of the \"work\" of government affairs is to blocklegislation at very early stages. I suspect that govt. affairs needs tojustify its existence for internal budgets at Enron and thus the benefitsof the function are important to quantify. I'd like to review any of theprevious work and make suggestions as necessary.At some point, let me know how you would like to proceed.Otherwise, I hope all is well with you all.Cordially,DougDoug SchulerRice UniversityJesse H.

We were one of the early parties pointing out the problems with total reliance on the spot market and encouraging more forward contracting.   Given the utilities' precarious financial position there were two options: 1) outsource the default provider obligation to the market (this is what we prefer but there was no political support for it), or 2) have the state put its credit behind the purchases.   California is pursuing the latter, with CDWR prucahsing the utilities' requirements.   In the short term, we have criticized the state's plan because it contemplates state takeover of the grid; state participation in power plant financing, construction, and ownership; and they have not made it clear that CDWR really has the money to pay for all the purchases.

This week has been very quiet on Capitol Hill as all of the members are back in the states on August recess running for re-election and it is a big vacation week for staff...but here's what I am hearing:As you may or may not know, we have been been very active this year trying to temper pipeline safety legislation that was fairly reactionary in the wake of last summer's liquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, WA.   SENATE:   In June, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Slade Gorton (R-WA) led the charge to pass a pipeline safety bill (S. 2438) out of the Senate Commerce Committee, and that bill is awaiting floor action in the Senate.   Because of the hasty way in which S. 2438 was drafted and passed, there was a realization by both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate that the bill could not make it to the floor for a vote until some serious changes were made --- mostly things that were deal breakers for industry.   Enron and El Paso were leading the charge and we had a number of Senators backing our efforts to negotiate changes, including Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), John Breaux (D-LA), and Sam Brownback (R-KS).   From what I've learned since the accident, these Senators are not changing their strategy and are still asking for the same improvements.   Fortunately, most of the changes we were looking to make were fairly technical and not the types of things that would be seriously compromised by the accident.   Industy was already in the position of having to accept a number of things they never would have if not for he Bellingham incident...the El Paso incident just reinforces those.   The biggest potential effect I see from the El Paso accident is an increased effort to pass something before the Congress adjourns in early October.   The New Mexico Senators are already calling for a floor vote on the McCain/Gorton legislation, and I there will certainly be greater pressure on leaders to wrap up negotiations, get agreement from all sides on a bill, and move it unanimously through a vote on the Senate floor.HOUSE:   The House is moving a bit more slowly, but again, I'd expect the El Paso situation to expedite things somewhat.   There were several bills introduced in the House that were not moving anywhere, including an identical copy of the McCain legislation introduced by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ).   Franks is now anxious to move legislation, as he is running for Senate and would love to take credit for helping out on an issue of national visibility.   Before the accident, House Tranportation Committee leaders on both the Democrat and Republican side were working on a \"consensus\" bill that they could introduce in early September and move quickly through the Committee and to the House floor.   I'm told that negotiations on that legislation are moving forward and a draft bill will be produced shortly.   Unlike our experience in the Senate, we have had significant input into the bill in advance, and expect something that we can live with --- and something more reasonable than the McCain bill.   With that said, there may be an effort to expand the bill in a few areas because of the El Paso accident, so we'll have to see what kind of hand we're dealt in the next few weeks.   Overall, I'd expect pipeline safety legislation to be given higher priority when Congress returns after Labor Day.   In the absence of this accident, I would have given it slim odds of passing in the few short weeks until adjournment, with appropriations bills taking up most of Congress' precious time.   Now there will be greater pressure to come to consensus and move bills through by an expedited process, so that everyone running for election in November can show that they've done something about this terrible tragedy.   With that said, there's still not that much time to get legislation through, so I'd say that there's still a chance it may not get done this year.   If I had to attach a number to it, I'd say that the El Paso accident improves the chances of legislation going all the way to probably 50-60%.2)   Gas supply to California:   I'll have to do some more checking in this area and get back to you.   All I've heard so far is that the safety questions that remain may slow the speed of restarting flow on the line, notwithstanding that El Paso thinks it can have things running again fairly quickly.   I'm sure the power crunch in California will put some counter-pressure on, but I just don't have good intelligence on this yet.With all this said, I'm on vacation this week and parts of next week finishing up some leave I've taken for the birth of our new baby daughter, so I may not have an additional report for you until early to mid next week.If you have questions, please respond by e-mail, or leave a message on my voice mail at 202-4666-9157.Regards,Jeff Keeler   \tFrom:   Cynthia Sandherr   08/23/2000 09:48 AM Sent by: Allison NavinTo: Clayton Seigle/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Jeffrey Keeler/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Sandherr/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: pipeline aftermath   Jeff Keeler in our office handles pipeline safety issues and I am copying him on this e-mail so that he may reply to you directly.

What is the status of pipeline safety legislation on the Hill, and what is the outlook for action between now and the end of the year?2.   What are people from California saying about the added pressure on gas supplies, and what are people from New Mexico saying about restarting the flow of gas while safety questions remain?These questions come straight from the top, and any information you could provide would be very helpful.   Please write me back or call and let me know if/when you think we might be able to get some initial answers.Thanks very much!Clay \n"

It's a common misconception that we will be mostly working on asset disposition.   Our focus will be on the efficient operation of the assets, cleaning up problems, finishing projects etc.   The sales efforts will be conducted through Cliff Baxter's group with support from us.   So, I don't believe that   I will need the type of effort that you believe David can provide and I have no other need for him at this juncture.   Cliff may feel that he has the need for David.   By the way, my experience with David when he worked for APAChi was that he had not learned much about the business and therefore was not terribly helpful to us as we were restructuring the group or when we were in a build mode in Thailand.If you have any questions, please let me know.Regards,RebeccaMark Schroeder@ECT12/08/2000 08:35 AMTo: Rebecca McDonald/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, James A Hughes/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: regulatory supportWith your new organisation, I expect that you will have issues that will require support from my team, covering everything outside the Americas (Rick Shapiro providing support in the Americas).

If that is correct, I want to run one idea by you.   We still have David Merrill posted as an expat in Singapore.   He is not working out as support for EBS (totally new field to him).   What are your thoughts on David returning to the energy arena, and focussing on flying around, as appropriate, to meet with various governments, working to secure necessary approvals, as/when/if needed?

From your message I think there may be some miscommunication between your PR guys and us.   We understood that your PR people wanted to reprint the Op-ed and redistribute it to as-yet-undetermined people, along with various Enron material.   They also wanted to post it on Enron's public web site.But your message seemed to indicate you just want to post the op-ed on your intranet -   for educational use only for your internal folks.   If this is correct, we would have no problem with it. In fact, we have posted the op-ed on the CERA web page - which is theoretically available to every Enron employee for internal use only.   If you want you could just post a link to the CERA web site so your people could get direct access to all our research on the topic.If I misunderstood you, and you do want to redistribute the piece to third-parties --- that is a much bigger issue because it involves our intellectual property and   branding issues.   Obviously, we would need to talk some more about this.   I hope this helps.On a somewhat-related note, we are also getting sucked more and more into the California vortex, and being asked to help in areas that are not our traditional business, such as expert witness testimony and policy issues.   While we are not afraid to take a point of view (as you know!) we must maintain a neutral and independent posture.   This is sometimes a difficult path to navigate, but we are exploring two areas that may also interest Enron:1. We have examined Joskow and FERC's analysis on the price gouging issue and we believe there are several major flaws in their methodologies.   We are considering how best to broadcast our assessment, without impinging on our core business, or becoming an expert witness.   We think a workshop, similar to the Monday event at CERAWeek could work, where we would present our findings and issue a report.2. We are also looking into the economic impact of power outages in the West - especially linked to the overall fragile state of the US economy.   This would be a collaborative effort with a major economic forecasting firm or university.   Again the reults would go to our clients, but could be released to a wider audience, and a workshop might help highlight the release.Please let us know if either topic would be of interest to Enron.   We would need to raise funding from various clients to help underwrite the effort , but the work would be CERA's independent research and we would stand fully behind it.Hope all is well. ...Peter .   \n"

I do not make it my habit to follow this sector, and we have never discussed my following this here in the UK.   However, I just wanted you to be aware, and you can pass along as you see fit, that recent developments in the UK water sector should create new business opportunities for Wessex (and, indeed, trade press here reports as much).   I am also not trying to \"end run\" either Colin Skellett (CEO) or Keith Harris (reg. affaris at Wessex), both of whom I have a high regad for.   just wanted to get this into the right circles.   The development is the \"mutualisation\" of water distribution companies.   This was proposed last year by Kelda, in England, and turned down by the water regulator.   It is essentially securitising the future income streams of the pipes business, servicing bonds, and making the customers the owners (there is essentially no equity stake).   Thus, the license obligation to invest in infrastructure is on the customers themselves (raises interesting enforcement problems).   The \"services\" part of the business is \"outsourced\" on a competitive basis (this is where Wessex would come in).   As I noted, such a proposal has previously been rejected.   Now, though, it is proposed to \"mutualise\" the Welsh water company.   Normally the regulator would reject this, for being unsound along the same lines as the earlier proposal.   However, the leaders of this \"mutualisation\" effort in Wales are 2000 of the \"great and the good\" leaders of the Welsh business community, and it is seen as a source of Welsh \"national\" pride to take back ownership of their water industry, i.e., meaning it is going to happen.   We now have a new water regulator who is smart enough not to stand in the way of Welsh politics, and has said he thinks the proposal has some merit and he will look not reject it out of hand.   Wessex could bid on the \"services\" agreement for this company, and if approved, this \"mutualisation\" will open the door for others to follow, and and hence more opportunities for Wessex.   Hope this is of some interest and use to you.   mcs\n"

        " Joannie Williamson/Corp/Enron on 03/16/20001 09:18 AM ---From: Chris Hilgert@ECT on 03/16/20001 08:43 AMTo: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Red Herring ArticleJeff,I was recently skimming the Enron news articles on Yahoo Finance and saw this one published in Red Herring about the sad demise of the renewable energy business in California:http:///www.redherring.com/index.asp?layout=story&amp;amp;doc_id=10400018104&amp;channel=10001I thought the article was reasonable until I got to a certain part about the impact that recent high prices have had on these companies and Enron was mentioned in a rather improper light, in my opinion.   Below is a short excerpt from the article with a particular sentence highlighted concerning Enron:\"Proponents of renewable power viewed California's deregulation as flawed from the onset three years ago. Still, they anticipated that with adequate publicity millions of consumers could be persuaded to switch from the traditional power supply, which comes mainly from the more polluting fossil fuels and nuclear power, and that the demand would spur supply. The number of producers and retailers getting into the green market would then only grow --- as long as the big utilities didn't interfere.That's what almost happened. Over the last three years, retailers like Green Mountain Energy and Utility.com bought green power already available in California and started to invest in building their own renewable energy generators, like windmill farms and large solar-panel assemblies. Still, for all the optimism and effort, only about 2000,000 customers --- less than 1 percent of the 8.5 million households that had the option of switching providers --- chose to support them. Many of those were swayed by a deregulation-mandated credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for consumers who switched. When natural gas prices were high, the credit actually represented a real savings. Historically, environmentally conscious consumers have paid a penny or two more per kilowatt hour for renewable energy, along with an average monthly surcharge of $5.Then, last fall, the fledgling industry started to crumble. Energy wholesalers like Enron (NYSE: ENE) and Calpine (NYSE: CPN) responded to a rising demand for energy by raising their prices from 6 cents per kilowatt hour to as much as $1.50. Green retailers had trouble getting credit to buy power. Many chose to drop out of the market rather than have to charge a price that was less than their cost. When the energy crisis hit, many green consumers' bills more than doubled.\"In light of the recent e-mail that was sent out, I thought that I would bring this to your attention as it may warrant a response to bring clarity that Enron does not raise prices, it transacts in a market where prices are set by supply and demand.   The average person reading this could very easily come to the conclusion that Calpine and Enron broke the back of the renewable energy companies, which is clearly not the case.   Nonetheless, thought you might find this of interest.Chris HilgertEnron AmericasEnron Compression Services\n"

Steve Letbetter will serve as chairman and CEO of=20\rthe unregulated company. David McClanahan has been named president and=20\rCEO of the regulated company, which will be created at the time of the=20\rbusiness separation. In July, Reliant Energy announced plans to separate=20\rinto two publicly traded companies in order to separate its unregulated=20\rbusinesses from its regulated businesses. Following regulatory approval,=20\rthe company plans an initial public offering (IPO) of approximately 20=20\rpercent of the common stock of its unregulated operations by early 20001.\r ANALYSIS: In June 1999, Texas adopted legislation to allow retail competiti=\ron=20\rbeginning on Jan. 1, 20002, for the majority of customers within the state.=\r=20\rSenate Bill 7 mandated that utilities in the state construct firewalls=20\rbetween their operating companies. In other words, Texas utilities must=20\rhave separate companies=01*with separate financial records=01*for energy se=\rrvices,=20\rdistribution, generation, etc. In Texas, incumbent utilities must establish=\r=20\raffiliated retail units that will serve customers who do not switch, but=20\rthese units must be completely separate from the T&amp;D operation of the=20\rincumbent=20\rutility. At first, Reliant Energy resisted this mandate and lobbied to=20\rkeep its operations under one company. Thus, it was somewhat of a surprise=\r=20\rwhen Reliant announced in July that not only would it be splitting into=20\rtwo publicly traded companies, but also that it would be issuing an IPO=20\rfor the unregulated side of its operations. Currently, as one company with=\r=20\rboth regulated and unregulated operations, Reliant (NYSE: REI) is trading=\r=20\rat about $45 13/16 (at market close on 10/111). Reliant has declined to=20\rmake any projections about pricing of the IPO of its unregulated businesses=\r,=20\rwhich it expects to issue in early 20001, until it submits an S1 filing=20\rwith the SEC later this year. Reliant expects the IPO to be followed by=20\ra distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the unregulated=20\rcompany (within 12 months of the IPO).\r Reliant's motivations to divide itself into two companies are pretty=20\rstraightforward.=20\rOn one hand, the company is simply complying with the regulatory mandates=\r=20\rof Texas. Yet, more importantly, Reliant is turning the mandate into a=20\rfinancial opportunity by establishing two public companies with dramaticall=\ry=20\rdifferent risk / reward profiles. The unregulated side will include such=20\rbusinesses as power generation, marketing and trading, telecom, and the=20\rEuropean operations.

As Reliant=20\rattempts to penetrate new competitive markets, it intends to make itself=20\ran appealing investment opportunity for investors who are more \"growth=20\roriented and tolerant of risk,\" (as described by Letbetter). The most=20\rpractical=20\rway to maximize shareholder interest and boost stock value is for Reliant=\r=20\rto bifurcate its operations, offering two options for capital investment.=\r=20\r   It's a trend that is becoming more common in the energy industry, especiall=\ry=20\rwith regard to high-risk ventures. For instance, Southern Company just=20\rclosed the IPO of its aggressive subsidiary Southern Energy (NYSE: SOE)=20\ron Oct. 3. Southern Energy, a global energy company, has become one of=20\rSouthern Company's primary moneymakers (in the second-quarter alone, the=20\rsubsidiary reported $93 million in earnings). When the IPO of Southern=20\rEnergy closed, it brought total gross proceeds and a concurrent securities=\r=20\rof approximately $1.81 billion to its parent. Southern Energy's current=20\rstock price is running at $29 1/8 (at market close on 10/111). The IPO price=\r=20\rof Southern Energy on 9/27 was $222. Another example is Northern States=20\rPower (now part of Xcel Energy since it merged with New Century Energies),=\r=20\rwhich this June spun off a portion of its NRG Energy subsidiary, an=20\rindependent=20\rpower producer. (See IssueAlert from 10/2/000 for more information). In=20\raddition, the trend is visible in other industries as well. AT&amp;T recently=\r=20\rannounced its plans to spin off its customer long-distance business to=20\rshareholders.\r However, even though the financial rewards of such an IPO are enticing,=20\rthere are possible downsides to such a move as well. Moody's raised serious=\r=20\rconcerns about Reliant's announcement in particular. Specifically, Moody's=\r=20\rsays that Reliant's regulated unit could be left with heavy debt loads=20\rafter the structural split, which would hurt its own quality and bond=20\rratings.=20\rMoody's has put both Reliant Energy Inc. and at least two of its subsidiari=\res=20\ron watch for possible downgrade from their Baa 1 status. Reliant remains=20\ron watch for possible downgrade as of Oct. 111. Another risk is that as=20\rmore spin offs of non-generation units become commonplace, they may lose=20\rtheir appeal on Wall Street. The average first-day gain for similar energy=\r=20\rIPOs was 43 percent in the third quarter, compared to 96.5 percent in the=\r=20\rfirst quarter, perhaps indicating that Wall Street is already becoming=20\rless enamored with this strategy.\r Yet, these risks aren't dissuading Reliant from moving forward with its=20\rplan. As the company retains but moves beyond its traditional electricity=\r=20\rand natural-gas distribution businesses, Reliant's focus is to expand its=\r=20\rcurrent business portfolio. By splitting its two operations in two, Reliant=\r=20\rcan separate its vastly different regulated and unregulated cultures. The=\r=20\rcompanies require totally different management approaches, one based more=\r=20\rin regulatory relations and the other driven by entrepreneurial spirit.=20\rThe freedom Reliant gains from spinning off its operations into two separat=\re=20\rbusinesses=01*one high risk, one low risk=01*appears to make this a smart m=\rove,=20\rat least for now.\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\rDiscover a world of utilities information in our new e-zine, SourceBook=20\rOnline.

Let me suggest the following, each of whom has different attributes:1.   David Wilcox, Asst. Sec of Economic Policy of Treasury, soon to rejoin the Federal Reserve.   David is an excellent macro economist but is not a \"big name.\"2.   Ted Truman, Asst. Sec of International Affairs, Treasury.   Ted is about join a think tank.   Before his stint at Treasury, Ted served 26 years at the Federal Reserve, many of which he served as Greenspan's right hand on international currency issues.   Ted has quarterbacked about every international currency intervention conducted by the United States over the last three decades.   3.   Larry Summers, Secretary.   Larry will be joining a think tank for a few weeks.   He may or may not be available.   If the topic is of interest to him, he is agreeable to travel and speaking engagements.   This is just my initial cut at some suggestions.   Once we know the Bush team, we may want to explore possible candidates from their ranks, although government ethics rules may prohibit us from paying for their travel to a \"customer conference.\"   Government officials can accept travel from 50l&amp;copy;(3)s, as a general rule.\n"

The FTC has invited comments on a number of specific issues, but their goal is to \"examine various state retail competition programs and describe those features that have resulted in consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits.\"   There are some obvious areas where we'll comment - California - but I'd appreciate people sending me specific examples of good or bad regulatory policies in other states.   Also, does anyone know of any good reports or analyses already prepared on these issues?   Thanks.   -Bob   \n"

Ross Perot has approached Enron about promoting its system in the Midwest ISO.   We used this system for Enron control area's EMS.   Ross Perot is going to contact Steve Kean to set up a meeting to show us his product.   Also, Kevin Presto thinks that OATI would be a good investment.Steve Kean---Steve Horn and Shashi Patel are interested in being included in a presentation by Perot.Sarah and Joe---Can you think of any FERC regulatory constraints that would limit Enron's ability to invest in one of the software providers to utilities/RTOS?

I recommend talking with Steve Kean and Joe Hartsoe ASAP to coordinate with the ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium regarding the Midwest ISO.   Dick George from ESCA mentioned that Ross Perot would like to make contact at a high level inside Enron to discuss the merits of Enron supporting a for-profit transco structure for the Midwest ISO.   The ESCA/OATI/Perot System consortium is offering a system to the Midwest ISO that is designed to support   a for-profit transco.   The consortium's primary competitor (ABB) has a system that supports the more structured ISO environment (similar to California and PJM). ---",

The view isthat a for-profit-ISO goes completely against the grain and that only amandate by FERC will get them to change.   Given Entergy's fight with FERCeven a mandate will be a hard fought court exercise.At present there are sixteen control areas therefore the system requirementwith grandfathered contracts in each is odious.Nevertheless, the form ESCA and our partners Perot, OATI and Tenfold offeris a full-up system ready for a for-profit implementation.   As you mightexpect the division of responsibilities on the proposal is Perot as ProgramManager (their position with the California ISO again), OATI for Tagging andCongestion Management, Tenfold for Settlement and Billing, and finally ESCAfor the EMS/Market Systems.   We prefer a for-profit model as it betters ouroffering and provides more near-term opportunity.Discussions with the Perot, OATI and Tenfold partners concurred that sharinginformation with Enron and vice-versa would help all of us understand howeach side may be able to position ourselves with the Midwest ISO.   Mutualhelp and cooperation is to our partners, ESCA's and it would seem Enron'sadvantage.MIDWEST ISO BOARD OF DIRECTORS   JAMES H.

Present were ESPs, consumer groups, business interests, the utlities and representatives from the Department of Finance, the DWR and Finance's Bond Counsel.   The meeting was led by Laurence Lingbloom from Senator bowen's office.Aaron Thomas led off with an articualtion of the AReM/business coalition proposal. Successive presentations were given by interests who submitted either correspondence or draft proposals- the details of which can be discussed in tomorrow's conference call.Of particular note, and the greatest obstacle facing the future of da, was the presentation by the attorney representing the Dept. of Finance.   He expressed concern over broad exemptions from exit fees (ie: all residential and small commercial customers &lt; 1000kw) and broad authority to opt out will make it extremely difficult to actually sell the bonds.   We need to follow up with Finance, their counsel and DWR to allay their fears- the sooner the better.   We need to be able to speak their language on bonding particulars and we need to be able to articulate our position in terms relavant to their bonding requirements.   We can discuss this further in the call tomorow.Finally, Lingbloom said he will circulate a proposal of his own by midweek next.   The general tenor at the conclusion of the meeting was not good- we have our work cut out for us.Until tomorrow.Norm   \n"

Please provide any remaining comments to the draft Schedules as soon as you can.   I realize there will still be some holes, as we continue to negotiate the Purchase and Sale Agreement.   No doubt it would help to have the Appendices to the Purchase and Sale Agreement completed, or say maybe a dollar amount or two completed in the Definitions section.   Thanks for all the help.

With the overwhelming majority votes in both the House and Senate this week, the bill will now be enrolled and sent to the President for signature.Although the statutory language and report language is a clear victory for EFS; we did not in the end have the draft colloquy entered into the record regarding the enforcement interpretation.   Seems EEI's lawyers had submitted a colloquy of their own.   Thus, our colloquy successfully served the purpose of blocking theirs which we should list as a \"victory\" given that their colloquy would have been damaging to us.   So in the end, Enron achieved all its legislative goals while EEI was unsuccessful in even gaining a statement for the record.Off the record, we did gain acceptance for the issue raised in our colloquy by DOD and they stand ready to defend their enforcement authority; possibly at the upcoming NARUC meeting.Bill signature; and thus, Public Law enactment, could occur as early as next week.   We will keep you advised as to when this occurs.   Again, congratulations to the team for a successful legislative effort against some stiff odds.\n"

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants).   Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.   Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.   Their message was simple (and simplistic):El Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.   It's attached.   Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics.Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling.Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of   the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.Best,Jeff\n"

Due to press of other matters I will be brief.First, your speech caption, refernecing \"mergers\" is somewhat different than the topic shown in the agenda, i.e., \"Industry Structure and Competitive Behaviour\", but I trust you are wroking that out with the BIEE.   Second, in your first paragraph, you note that developments in the energy sector over the last decade are due to the mergers of the last five years (a point I will retrun to later), but in any event, not entirely consistent in terms of timeframes.Third, I am surprised that the Enron Corp. view is that gas and electricity markets grew as they did over the decade due to mergers.   In the past, things like unbundling and non-discriminatory third-party access have featured prominently in our advocacy.   Indeed, though it was not my role at Enron, I would have thought that in many of the recent electricity mergers pre-dating Order No. 888 we would have joined the chorus of voices arguing that these mergers concentrated market power, and that such market power could only be mitigated with the provision of non-discriminatory third-party access (an argument we will be repeating in, e.g., Germany, as noted below).   Finally, I would note that in the past, I thought we had questioned the value of mergers as an impediment to competitive markets, as I recall Ken Rice gave an infamous address/speech, in which he described \"good\" mergers and \"bad\" mergers, i.e., defensive mergers like Houston Industries and NorAm.   I actually borrowed heavily from that speech two years ago, in paris, but if we have changed our tune, that is good to know.   Even the \"good\" mergers identified in his/my speech, e.g., Enron/Portland, have had the \"goods\" thwarted, in part, by regulators, who would not let us do all we wanted to do that was pro-competitive.   Also, in the past, we have used as a good example of \"convergence\" the arbitrage we have done at Sithe's facility in NY, pointing out that we are in an \"energy\" or \"BTU\"market, not gas alone, or electricity alone.   Not clear to me that mergers in the US demonstrate this.   Fourth, accepting that it is the Enron Corp. view that mergers are symbolic of the convergence of gas and electricity, and are what yield the many beneifts of competition that you dsicuss elsewhere in your speech (I do, of course, agree with all the platitueds that competition yilds more service offerings, innovation, etc.), you should be aware, coming over to this market, that a number of mergers are taking place that we have expressed concerns about in comments to the regulators, and will do so in the future.   here are some you should be aware of:   Veical integration in the UK electricity industry (not clear yet that this will result in better/more service, but definitely loss of counter-parties, re-bundling of business before retail unbundling/competition has taken hold); Exxon/Mobil (consolidation in the upstream sector in Continental Europe, which is already concentrated), VEBA/VIAG in Germany (probalby okay, assuming thrid-party access is allowed/enhanced to the wires).   Just FYI, any objections we have are usually communicated confidentially. Fifth, if you are ging to emphasise mergers, as per your title and opening paragraph, I question the inclusion of all the discussion on privatisation, which is good, but does not seem to demonstrate the benefits of merger activity, which I read is the premise of your speech, per paragraph one.   In addition, recitation of ownership of miles of gathering lines and transmission lines does demonstrate change in aggregate ownership, but not clear it is all due to mergers (e.g., I thin NNG is just capital expansion), nor does the connection get made that this has lead to innovative or enhanced service offerings.   I do think excellent points can be made about the deregulation/divestment of gathering, and getting it out of federal regualtroy purview, but that is not in the speech at this point.Sixth, you describe \"network industries\" well, but in the broader context of your speech, I think your listeners will assume you are referring to the physical network, rather than the Enron vision, which you capture accurately, nor is it easily understood how this demonstrates or adds to your point about convergence.   Seventh, in your table of converged companies, you could be asked about the fact that Duke has already disposed of the pipeline assets it acquired in the PanEnergy deal (since sold to CMS), apparently keeping only the trading business.   Also, our pieeline assets to do not serve our cogen facilites in NJ, so not clear to me that thisdemonstrate convergence in the East Coast.Hope this helps.   I will be travelling today and Monday, but if you have questions, please leave me voice mails, and I will return your calls.P.S. at p. 7 you describe \"secular\" change.   I assme that this should read \"sectoral\" change.Mark\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nI agree with Mark's points.   While we have advocated our merger with PGE (which did not concentrate market power) we have intervened in opposition to most others.   Moreover, there is some hope that the German government will take the opportunity to use the proposed utility merger to force greater open access.   We will likely encourage that action and may oppose the merger otherwise.   Most mergers in this industry are defensive, not procompetitive, and, in my view, deserve no credit for convergence, innovation, or liberlization.---"

Business; Financial Desk   State's Power Grid Again Pushed to Brink of Rolling Blackouts Energy: High   temperatures, generator shutdowns push usage within 5% of capacity. Heat wave is   expected to continue today.   NANCY RIVERA BROOKS   09/19/2000   Los Angeles Times   Home Edition   Page C-1   Copyright 2000 / The Times Mirror Company   Sweltering weather across California pushed the state's heat-stressed electricity grid close   to meltdown Monday, and state power officials urged electricity conservation because today   and Wednesday could be even worse.   Power was cut to hundreds of large business customers and about 125,000 residential and   business air-conditioner and agricultural pumping customers Monday after the California   Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity grid for about 75% of the state,   declared a Stage 2 power emergency. At Stage 2, when the grid is using more than 95% of   available power, the state's big investor-owned utilities are asked to interrupt power to   customers that have agreed to this voluntary action in exchange for discounted rates.   Grid reliability was threatened when two electricity units in Northern California stopped   working for a time as heavy air-conditioner demand began to push power use higher,   Cal-ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said.   Demand peaked at about 42,000 megawatts on the Cal-ISO grid, but the two unidentified   units, representing about 320 megawatts of generation, were returned to service in the   afternoon---in time to help keep the state from reaching its first Stage 3, which would lead to   neighborhood blackouts.   \"We were right on the edge of warning about a possible Stage 3,\" McCorkle said. \"A couple   of generators fell offline in late morning, and that kind of gave everybody a scare.\"   A Stage 3 emergency would be declared if power reserves fall below 1.5%---in essence,   when the electricity grid is using more than 98.5% of available power---and rotating outages   of nonessential customers for an hour or longer would become likely to keep the grid from   failing. That would result in widespread blackouts lasting several hours.   Electricity use was also high in the area served by the Los Angeles Department of Water   and Power, peaking near 4,750 megawatts Monday. But DWP customers were not   threatened by power interruptions or rolling blackouts because the municipal utility has   more than enough generating capacity to meet demand.   \"We're doing OK as we have all summer long,\" said DWP General Manager S. David   Freeman.   Cal-ISO asked Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp;   Electric to call on all of their interruptible-power customers to immediately stop using   electricity, representing a potential 3,000 megawatts, or roughly the amount of electricity   used by 3 million homes.   Thousands of students at College of the Canyons in Valencia experienced the California   equivalent of a snow day Monday when power outage alarms rang about 1:30 p.m, the   seventh time this year, college spokesman Sue Bozman said. If the college doesn't pull the   plug, it pays a big fine.   \"For several years, we saved $1000,000 a year by being on this interruptible-service plan,\"   said Bozman, who with other administrators finished the work day with mobile phones and   portable computers. \"But when the alarm rings and we decline to turn off our power, it's a   whole different ballgame.\"   One such day in May, during final exams, the college didn't cut power and penalties totaled   $30,000, she said.   During the height of Monday's power crisis, PG&amp;E---whose territory suffered local blackouts   on June 14 in a similar reliability emergency---kept an open telephone line to Cal-ISO for   minute-by-minute updates, spokesman Ron Low said.   SCE and the other utilities begged customers to use as little electricity as possible, and   grocery stores around the state voluntarily reduced lighting and other power use to comply.   \"We're issuing a call to action, a call that everyone needs to take seriously,\" Pam Bass,   SCE's senior vice president for customer service, said in a statement as electricity use   soared Monday. \"If the demand for power does not decrease soon, we will be directed by   the state to begin shutting off power for blocks of customers. Everyone needs to cut their   use of power now to avoid forced outages.\"   Today and Wednesday could be even more challenging: Cal-ISO is predicting peak use of   444,827 megawatts for today. Peak demand was expected to be 444,537 megawatts on   Monday, but conservation and power-interruption programs kept the total lower.   \"We are anticipating tomorrow to be a good deal like today,\" SCE spokeswoman Karen   Shepard-Grimes said Monday. Electricity demand in SCE territory peaked at 17,860   megawatts before the Rosemead-based utility asked power customers to cut 2,5000   megawatts of electricity. \"It got really touchy today,\" she said.   *   Times staff writer Zanto Peabody contributed to this report.

Because they all mobilized at the same time, Darrell Kinder and I put in place a rotation plan whereby some would leave early, some extend (so we didnt have everyone leaving the JV at the same time). Its worked well to date, and we've mamanged to keep the Partners happy with the moves/replacements.Bottom line with respect to the Project Summer moratorium (in my view) is that because Stella will be replaced she is no longer part of the 'intellectual capital' the buyer (or any future buyer) is seeking to retain, and so the move should go ahead.Hope you concur.   ---",

She had shown some desire to repatriate early and under the repatriation agreement I allowed her to start her search (six months prior). Stella's search was very quick and she has landed a job with the Corporate Public Affairs group under Harry Kingerski, who works for Rick Shapiro, who works for Steve Kean. She has set a preliminary job switch for October 16, 2000.This does not cause me too much concern, for as you are aware Waymon Votaw who works in the Southern Cone group under John Guidry has shown a desire to be Stella's replacement. The timing of this could work out real well. Please pass this to the powers to be for approval so I may move forward with the next step with both individuals.ThanksTony\n"

I'm not sure if you remember but we met at the press briefing that Mr.Skilling held at the National Press Building at the end of the summer herein Washington to discuss the California electricity markets.   I am contacting you today in the hopes that I might be able to speakwith you or someone else from Enron for a story I am working on for thisweek's issue concerning American natural gas marketers moving into Europe. Iwas hoping I could interview someone with the company before Thursday sothat I could write the story before my Friday deadline.   For the story, I am basically looking to do background, i.e. How isthe European market different from the American market? Will the networkbusiness model translate well there? What kind of regulatory pitfalls do thecompanies' face? Will a liquid natural gas market develop in Europe? If so,what kind of timeline are we talking about? What is Enron's position andtake on the whole European market?   I would appreciate any time or guidance you might be able to give meon this subject. If you have any questions or comments please don't hesitateto call. Once again, thanks for your time.Sincerely,Christian SchmollingerStaff Reporter, Natural Gas Week1401 New York Ave., NW Suite 5000Washington, DC 20005Ph. 202-6662-0726Fax 202-347-8089 \n"

In some cases such payments may still be legal.   But, subject to Jane confirming that I am explaining this correctly (given that the communication below is a bit cryptic), it now seems to me to be timely (as Rebecca and Jim have apparently been alerted in London on Monday, per her note below) to satisfy yourself that we are now clean on this issue under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   The informal customs advice was obtained by Muktesh Tyagi (spelling?), one of two people known as Sanjay's \"fixers\" (that should make you fell comfortable!).   You may wish to discuss with Jane further, but once you satisfy yourself that there is some smoke here, my thought was that you might want to simply confirm with Rebecca that we are running the facts to ground, so that we can satisfy ourselves that we are either clean, or need to come clean with USG.   let me know if you need more.   thanks mcs   ---",

SPM   (This equipment has already been imported at 222.38%, but customs is claiming merit duty rates of 67%.) This is currently being evaluated by the courts. Total Value at Risk = $7 MM2. \"D\" - Stream Are Bechtel's design charges of $666 MM specific to our equipment or to the project as a whole?   If the former, then duty of 222.38% should apply. Total Value at Risk = $13.5 MM   ($666 MM x 222.38%)PHASE II ISSUES1. Services Loading on Power Plant Equipment Same issue as for LNG Equipment. Currently we are paying a 10% loading on duty into a reserve deposit to cover this. Total Value at Risk = $222.38 MM   ($1000 MM x 222.38%)2. LNG Equipment to be dutied at 53.8% or 222.38%? Think we all know this issue. Total Value at Risk = $56 MM (as per Risk Matrix)3. Services Loading on LNG Equipment Think we all know this issue Total Value at Risk = $80 MM   ($149 MM x 53.8%)TOTAL VALUE at RISK ~$180 MM - - This is WORST, WORST CASE!Note:   There is still this issue of goods being imported under the wrong classification.   Currently, this is preventing goods from being imported on time, which could lead to delay claims by the contractors.   It will take me some time to hunt down what this could cost us if the problem isn't resolved soon.   Pavan's estimate is that it will take a month for Site to generate accurate equipment lists and for the same to be reviewed and approved by MSEB.Heidi\n"

Commitment to Provide Power =01) SCE will keep its current generation pla=\rnts=20\rand other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulated=\r=20\rcost-of-service basis for 10 years.\r? Dedication of Power =01) Edison International will commit the entire outp=\rut of=20\rSunrise (one of Edison International=01,s non-regulated generating faciliti=\res)=20\rto the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years. Phase I of Sunrise is to =\rbe=20\rbrought online by August 15, 20001. If not brought online by August 15, 20001=\r,=20\rEdison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty.\r? Transmission Sale =01) SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets=\r for=20\rapproximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets),=\r=20\rsubject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion gain=\r=20\ron sale, will be used to reduce SCE=01,s net undercollected amount as of Ja=\rnuary=20\r31, 20001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certa=\rin=20\rliabilities associated with the transmission assets.\r? Backup Transaction =01) If the transmission sale does not occur within tw=\ro=20\ryears for reasons beyond the parties=01, control, then if the State elects,=\r SCE=20\rshall sell to the State SCE=01,s hydro generation assets. If the hydro asse=\rts=20\rare not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe=\rr=20\r31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall.\r? Conservation Property =01) SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen=\rts to=20\rthe State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr=\ric=20\rrelated lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related=20\rlands.   Some of the land may be deeded in fee.\r? Contribution by Edison International =01) Edison International will refun=\rd to=20\rSCE not less than $4000 million.   This money will consist of a refund of=20\rapproximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus=20\rapproximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings.\r? Investment =01) Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3=\r=20\rbillion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE.\r? Litigation =01) SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings a=\rnd=20\rfiled rate doctrine cases.\r? CPUC Regulation =01) CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical=\r=20\rprinciples of ratemaking.\r? Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off =01) SCE shall pay an amount that=20\rrepresents that portion of the net short from January 18, 20001 to April 1,=\r=20\r20001 that is attributable to QF=01,s not selling to SCE (due to SCE=01,s fa=\rilure to=20\rpay the QF=01,s).   SCE will securitize this amount.\r? Securitization =01) SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou=\rnt=20\r(approx. $3.5 billion).   The securitization shall occur in two tranches (i.=\re.=20\rtwo different nonbypassable dedicated rate components).\r ? The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the=20\rsigning of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected=\r=20\ramount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the=\r=20\rnet undercollected amount.\r? The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not=\r=20\roccur within two years.   Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up =\rin=20\rrates for two years, if at all.\r ? Buying the Net Short =01) The State will be required to buy the net short=\r=20\rthrough December 31, 20002.   After 20002 SCE will be responsible for covering=\r=20\rthe net short.\r? Investment Recovery =01) SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that=\r will=20\rnot drop below its current rte (111.6%) during the 10 year cost of service=\r=20\rratemaking period.\r?

But, as you would expect, the market responded by proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak demand growth.   The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, has failed to site this new generation.   The problem is regulation, not deregulation.When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current summer levels (Enron's price was about $555/MWH).   After publication of Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.   Again, the market responded where regulation failed.   San Diego has not accepted any of these offers because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside of the PX (i.e. the spot market).In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional generation.   Enron built 3 plants in response to the 19998 price spikes.   Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time for the summer of 1999.   Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market responds.The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition not reregulation.

        " Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 02/20/20001 01:09 PM ---\tMike J Miller@ECT\t02/15/20001 111:06 AM \t\t\t To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron\t\t\t cc: Joseph Deffner/Enron@EnronXGate, W David Duran/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jordan Mintz/HOU/ECT\t\t\t Subject: Tax Lobbying Initiative for Generation Finance VehicleSteve,I'm sending this memo to you as a reminder of our one minute conversation in the garage last night.BackgroundGoing back almost three years, John Stinebaugh and I started looking for a more efficient method to finance generation projects.   We explored two avenues, creating a Master Limited Partnership (\"MLP\") or a Real Estate Investment Trust (\"REIT\") to own the projects (with Enron as a manager).   The advantages of a MLP or a REIT structure are twofold (i) they provide direct access to the public equity markets and (ii) they provide a lower cost of equity capital because earnings are taxed at the \"equity holder\" level, not at the MLP/REIT level, i.e., you do not have double taxation on earnings as with a publically held \"C\" corporation.   John and I pursued these avenues with Jordan Mintz because we wanted to create an off-balance sheet vehicle that would provide a lower overall cost of capital so that ENA could be more competitive in bidding for acquisitions.   The same vehicle would also have provided another exit vehicle for the peakers or other assets that ENA was developing at the time.Jordan explored both MLP and REIT avenues.   The MLP was quickly disqualified because electric generation and transmission assets do not qualify as assets that can be financed using an MLP structure.   The REIT structure was more promising to the point where Jordan had prepared and submitted a request for a private letter ruling from the IRS allowing certain types of generating assets to be placed into REIT.   Unfortunately, the IRS ruled against our request.ConceptThere would still be real value to Enron in having the tax laws changed to allow generation and transmission assets to be placed into either a REIT or an MLP.   ENA holds economic interests in QF's in third party (non-utility) vehicles.   Being able to package these into an MLP/REIT would provide a good exit strategy for these and other investments we may acquire in the future.   Other efforts, such as building/controlling transmission or purchasing/developing coal-fired generation projects would also benefit from access to cheaper equity capital.The public policy benefit is pretty clear.   Avoiding double taxation of profits/dividends would lower the cost of equity capital invested in generation and transmission assets.   This in turn should have a beneficial effect on encouraging construction of new (and badly needed) generation and transmission assets by lowering the equity return that holders of these assets would require.   You could even take existing rate-regulated utility generation and transmission assets and lower rates by placing these assets into MLP's or REITS by eliminating the federal and state taxes that are factored into rates to give utilities their after-tax allowed rates of return.Given the recent attention on California and de-regulation in general, creating more tax-efficient ownership vehicles for these assets could provide a way to lower costs without having states acquire these assets and gain financing advantages through tax-exempt bond issues.ConclusionGiven the momentum that may be gathering for new tax legistlation, coupled with the growing concer over energy policy, it may be a good time to float this change in tax law.   It could reasonably be argued that it would assist in directing capital into increasing generation/transmission supply, one of the key issues for California.   Jordan can update you further on what we have done in the past and what would need to be changed in the tax laws.Regards,Mike J Miller\n"

The tour was extremely educational andwe had a good discussion with Nate Ellis on Retail Services at the end ofthe day.I like your idea of getting the top executives together at some point soon --- I know our Chairman, Chuck Knight, would be very fascinated with thetransformation at Enron and your business models for future growth. He alsoloves to share and contrast different management processes and I think allinvolved would take away some ideas to consider. David Farr, our new CEO,would gain much from such an interaction and hopefully the establishment ofa long relationship between our firms and executive teams.On top of this, I see a tremendous potential for our firms to work togetherin a number of key areas where our product and service technologies wouldcomplement the Enron offering of market making and risk management. Iappreciate your offer to help navigate some contacts to evaluate some ofthese opportunities. Some initial impressions include:* Evaluating the use of Energy Services on a broad scale at Emersonoperations* Evaluating the solution package that we could jointly put together forindustrial customers with your Energy Services group and our remotelycontrollable transfer switch, UPS and back-up power technologies that wouldpermit remote (Enron) control of whether a site is on/off the grid or evenselling power back to the grid.* Evaluate the potential packages of Emerson systems, measuring devices,control elements, power diagnostic, remote monitoring and visualizationproducts and technologies for use with Energy Services contract offerings --- especially in specific vertical markets such as retail stores, grocerystores, pipelines, paper plants,   semiconductor fabs, etc. We have over 2000service and solutions people spread throughout USA and other world marketswhich could support this effort.* Enron Broadband Services is already a primary user of Emerson fiber opticconduit, precision air conditioning, UPS, and other power and connectivityproducts and services - - we can evaluate how we can extend our technologyplatform to support the bandwidth market making activity and the contentoffering of Enron.* I also see some potential for Enron finance and risk management ininternational infrastructure projects such as the Caspian Sea gasdevelopment - - where it looks like there will be 30+ years of gasproduction - - some of the local customers who are intrigued with embracingour new PlantWeb Fields technologies for better yield/uptime/assetmanagement have had trouble getting conventional project finance resourcesto support their projects. Given Enron understands what to do with gas inkind, there could be a very interesting triangular arrangement with Enron,Emerson, and local gas production companies.These are some initial thoughts - - I expect there may be several otherinteresting possibilities come to light as we start to have additionalconversations.Steve, again, thanks for the arrangements yesterday and I will be back toyou shortly to organize a follow-up set of conversations.Best Regards,Mike TrainVP PlanningEmerson Electric Co:T: 314-5553-2120F: 314-5553-3851\n"

(The safety issue could come up in your Q&amp;A.)Stinson Gibner---Stinson is with the research group that has generated some of the more complex slides in your draft dealing with volatility and historic futures pricing.Gil Muhl---Gil markets gas products to customers and is speaking at an AGA conference on the gas supply and price situation the day before your talk.   His group is focusing on new products to help end-users with winter volatility.   I have asked Gil to send you his presentation as well for the meeting.Back to your presentation (the draft slides of which I am delivering to you today), Dan Yergin thought it would be appropriate for you to give an overview of the situation as the \"teacher\" or \"professor.\"   Some questions that you could address would include:Where has the industry come from, and what lessons have we learned?How is the business different today?What public policy conclusions are implicit in this history?I think our comparative advantage over the specialists who will be presenting before and after your keynote is that you have \"been there\" in the evolution of the natural gas market, and Enron is at the forefront of helping customers deal with price and supply uncertainty.   There is also a good opportunity to stress the need for new industry \"best practices\" (more hedging) and the right public policies to deal with this issue (from \"do no harm\" to expanding incentives in the market).- Rob\n"

Will the swap work?Frank Gibney Jr./Houston08/28/2000Time MagazineTime Inc.38+(Copyright 2000)It's Saturday night, and the only thing between you and a movie from Blockbuster Video is the unpaid late fee forlast week's rental. If that sounds familiar, then you'll appreciate this: next year Blockbuster plans to offer up to 5000movie titles online in more than a dozen major cities around the U.S. That's right, video on demand (not thefrustrating no-rewind, no-pause pay-per-view offerings of today) for anyone with a DSL line at home. What's remarkable is that Blockbuster's partner happens to be an energy company called Enron. At a time whenso many old-economy companies seem helpless against the dizzying pace and technology of the digital age,Enron is demonstrating why FORTUNE magazine keeps voting it the most innovative large company in America.For years the Houston-based firm simply produced, transported and marketed natural gas. Then, as energyderegulation threatened profit margins in the gas business, Enron discovered it could make billions by trading andbrokering packages of energy the way Midwesterners do pork bellies. Now Enron is moving into thetelecommunications business, with a national fiber-optic cable network and a floor bulging with Sunsupercomputers.In fact, Enron may be the most interesting old-economy company around. Since moving its trading operations fromthe phone to the Web eight months ago, the company has doubled revenues to more than $30 billion. Most of thatis made through trading everything from energy and paper to weather risk derivatives and now bandwidth---more than8000 offerings in all. Think of eBay, but instead of auctioning $5 used Baby Gap pajamas, the company trades$6000,000 blocks of natural gas---and pockets commensurately huge commissions. Boasts Enron president JeffreySkilling: \"In terms of dollars transacted, we're the world's largest online site by a factor of 10.\" So far this year, that has meant $120 billion in transactions. And when you're running the network, all sorts ofprofitable opportunities arise. Last week, when word spread that natural-gas prices would spike this winter, Enron'sin-house traders saw their gains surge as customers raced to lock in future supplies at today's prices. And Enron'sstock price? It hit $90 last week, tripling its value of a year ago. Kind of like an Internet play, only better. The market loves Enron because Skilling and CEO Kenneth Lay seem to have come up with a business model thatworks for just about anything. They provide a service to their customers by packaging a supply of name yourcommodity and then using the efficiency of their vast network to beat most prices. They arrived at this model backin the mid-1980s almost out of desperation, when crude-oil prices had collapsed, natural-gas deregulation hadthrown that market into chaos, and the Peruvian government had just nationalized Enron's offshore properties.Figuring they might as well leverage deregulation instead of succumbing to it---call it business judo--- Skilling, aMcKinsey &amp; Co. consultant at the time, came up with a plan called the Gas Bank, to buy up reserves of naturalgas, then package them for sale, with various prices and conditions for different customers. When electricitymarkets deregulated a few years ago, the company did the same. It's the oldest concept in business: buy low, sellhigh. Enron also leverages its assets and expertise to provide services to big customers. Since 19997, companies likeOwens Corning and Chase Manhattan Bank have signed long-term, multibillion-dollar contracts with Enronsubsidiary Enron Energy Services (EES) that lock in their energy costs for up to 10 years and provide Enron with asteady revenue stream. What's more, Enron is beginning to actively manage its clients' heating and cooling plants,installing new equipment when necessary and monitoring it all over the Internet. Skilling's latest gambit is to apply the same principles he learned in the power and energy sectors to making Enrona leader in the booming telecommunications business. The plan isn't to go head to head with established fiber-opticcarriers such as AT&amp;T, Qwest and Williams Communications. Instead, Enron wants to use new switchingtechnology and its expertise in trading pipeline access to transform a modest telecom network into a powerfularbiter of bandwidth. Enron's bet is simple: supply and demand will increase exponentially, turning bandwidth into atradable commodity, just like gas and electricity. Along the way, why not partner with companies such asBlockbuster and use this new technology to offer content---like movies- -and blow it through existing, underutilizedpipe? \"They are jump- starting an application [telecom content] with a potential market of $2000 billion a year,\" saysTom Nolle, president of the telecom consulting firm CIMI. Other new-economy players are also beginning to see the power merchant as a prize partner. IBM and AOL havejoined with Enron to form the New Power Co. (TNPC), an independent start-up that will offer pricing schemes and achoice of power and gas service for residential and small-business customers. Enron provides the electricity; AOLenables customers to buy it via the Web; and IBM takes care of the billing. \"It's ludicrous that we're in the 21stcentury, and you still have people jumping over fences to read meters,\" says Skilling, pointing out that thetechnology exists to offer real-time pricing for gas and electricity. In deregulated markets, TNPC will allowconsumers to switch power companies as easily as they do phone companies. Despite all Wall Street's enthusiasm for Enron's bold plans, there are still plenty of skeptics. Critics point out thatthere is barely a market today for the company's bandwidth trading exchange. They also stress that pushing digitalsignals through pipe is a world away from routing natural gas. Although there is plenty of cable across the country,carriers are not set up to mix and match access to it. \"It's a very, very difficult concept,\" says Nolles. Even theBlockbuster venture is risky: technology aside, there is also the highly political question of digital rights. How doyou satisfy Hollywood that its content is secure? But Skilling and his lieutenants are quick to counter that everyone thought they were crazy to try to make marketsin gas and electricity. And Enron, after all, is a company that thrives on entrepreneurial defiance of convention.Many of its new ventures were started because managers simply set new ideas in motion without waiting forapproval from the top. Even the online operation was cobbled together in a mere seven months. Skilling and Layfound out about EnronOnline only two weeks before it went live. Is taking risks really a part of a gas-pipeline company's culture? Just ask John Arnold, the 26-year-old chief ofnatural-gas derivatives, who after nine hours and $1 billion in trades last Wednesday had this to say: \"You can't turnaway for a minute or you get picked off.\" That has happened to too many traditional companies because they wereunable to find a niche in the new economy. Enron, however, has traded its way into a starring role, and now ithopes it is ready for the movies.

Excelergy eXACT=01v,=\r=20\rdeveloped by energy software solutions company Excelergy Corporation, will=\r=20\rprovide the technology infrastructure for EBT Express.\r ANALYSIS: This is a significant development, as EBT Express represents=20\rthe first hub in Canada for retail energy transactions. The site will serve=\r=20\ras the central clearinghouse for immediate communication of customer data=\r=20\ramong hundreds of LDCs and energy retailers in Ontario, and possibly=20\rthroughout=20\rCanada.   I spoke yesterday afternoon with George Caraghiaur, Exelergy's=20\rvice president, Canada, about EBT Express. Caraghiaur believes that the=20\rsite \"will provide the essential technology for opening Ontario's electrici=\rty=20\rmarket in an efficient manner.\" That is no small undertaking as there are=\r=20\ran expected 3000 players that will need to communicate with each other in=20\rOntario once competition begins.\r Deregulation is happening in Canada on a province-by-province basis (much=\r=20\rlike it is happening state-by-state in the U.S.). Thus far, only Ontario=20\rand Alberta have set dates when electric customers will be able to select=\r=20\ra new energy supplier. Ontario is scheduled to become competitive next=20\rspring, and presently is the only region in which EBT Express will be=20\roperational.=20\rAlberta uses a point-to-point transaction process, which represents a very=\r=20\rcomplex model. Caraghiaur believes that the value of EBT Express will be=20\rclearly seen, and there will be many opportunities for the hub in Alberta=\r=20\rand elsewhere.\r The Ontario Energy Board (OEB), which is the equivalent of a state PUC,=20\rmandated the use of electronic business transactions (EBTs). The EBTs work=\r=20\ras follows: Once a customer selects a new energy supplier, the energy=20\rsupplier=20\rand the local distribution company (LDC) must continue to share information=\r=20\rabout that customer. This proprietary data, shared strictly on a one-to-one=\r=20\rbasis between the energy supplier and the LDC only, will include billing,=\r=20\rusage and payment information. Essentially, an LDC will read the meter=20\rand send usage information to the energy supplier, who will calculate its=\r=20\rportion of a customer's bill and in turn send this data back to the LDC,=20\rwhich will submit the customer bill. This represents a common way for billi=\rng=20\rin Ontario, although there are other options including consolidated billing=\r=20\rthat originates from the energy supplier and split billing coming from=20\rboth the LDC and energy supplier. No customer information will be exchanged=\r=20\runtil competition officially begins in Ontario, which now appears to be=20\rin the spring of 20001, although the technology infrastructure supplied=20\rby Excelergy is already in place.\r In response to the OEB's mandate, Toronto Hydro Corp. and Ontario Power=20\rGeneration=01*the largest players in electricity distribution and generatio=\rn=20\rin Ontario=01* became equity partners in the $7.7 million joint venture to=\r=20\rcreate EBT Express. All customer data will be contained within EBT Express,=\r=20\rwhich is supported by the eXACT technology. Excelergy eXACT is a software=\r=20\rsolution that translates, validates, manages and delivers data exchanged=20\ramong users. The functionality of eXACT has been used in several U.S. state=\rs,=20\rincluding Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In fact, eXACT was introduced to=20\rgas and electricity retailers in the United States in 1999 as a component=\r=20\rof Excelergy ABP=01v, a billing and customer information solution. Alleghen=\ry=20\rEnergy Supply, a subsidiary of Allegheny Energy, was one U.S. utility that=\r=20\rI know of that used the Excelergy technology.=20\r Caraghiaur contends that EBT Express will play an important role in enhanci=\rng=20\rthe competitive market in Ontario. \"There are presently 37 licensed retaile=\rrs=20\rin Ontario, 15 pending retailers and 246 LDCs,\" Caraghiaur told me. \"You=20\rcan imagine the cloud of communication pathways that would occur between=20\rall these players without a centralized hub such as EBT Express.\" The numbe=\rr=20\rof LDCs seemed awfully high to me, but Caraghiaur explained that in Ontario=\r=20\rmany LDCs serve only a small number of customers, often 1000 customers or=20\rless. This should change as consolidation reduces the number of LDCs in=20\rOntario but, when compared to the United States, Ontario still will have=20\ra comparatively high number of distribution companies.=20\r Caraghiaur cited Pennsylvania as an example of a market that has tried=20\rto assimilate communication among many market participants. Pennsylvania,=\r=20\ralong with most other U.S. states, still uses electronic data interchange=\r=20\r(EDI) as its standard, wherein every LDC has a slightly different=20\rinterpretation=20\rof data that is shared through the EDI. This can often cause communication=\r=20\rinconsistencies and retailers may have a difficult time in getting ready=20\rfor deregulation. \"EBT Express will be in the position to enforce standards=\r,\"=20\rsays Caraghiaur. \"The use of XML in particular will enhance communication=\r=20\rbetween market participants.\"\r In fact, XML (extensible market language) is the cornerstone of eXACT as=20\rit constructs a standardized language so that data can be exchanged but=20\rstill understood by different applications. Caraghiaur claims that Excelerg=\ry=20\ris on the forefront of XML technology, which was expressly stipulated in=20\rthe EBT standards developed by the Advisory Committee to the Ontario Energy=\r=20\rBoard. XML is a common language used on the Internet that makes it easier=\r=20\rand more cost-effective for buyers and sellers to exchange data between=20\rapplications and data sources that otherwise might have been incompatible.=\r=20\rIn addition, Excelergy's eXACT software is object-oriented, allowing for=20\reasy and rapid change from one program to another.=20\r Clearinghouse exchanges are definitely a trend in the energy industry.=20\rWhereas states that previously deregulated, such as California and=20\rPennsylvania,=20\rdid not use a centralized clearinghouse for customer information, states=20\rand provinces now formulating their restructuring plans often mandate them.=\r=20\rFor instance, Excelergy's competitor Logica has a market data clearinghouse=\r=20\rbuilt for the Midwest market. Also, the ERCOT-ISO has teamed with Andersen=\r=20\rConsulting on a similar market data clearinghouse for the Texas unbundling,=\r=20\rscheduled for pilot in the summer of 20001 and full market opening in Januar=\ry=20\r20002.\r One concern that market participants may have is the sharing of customer=20\rdata through EBT Express, especially when it is backed by potential=20\rcompetitors=20\rin the Ontario market such as Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power. Caraghiaur=\r=20\rresponded to this by saying that the OEB mandated the exchange of customer=\r=20\rinformation through an EBT structure. However, market participants are=20\rnot mandated to participate in EBT Express. They could opt to still exchang=\re=20\rinformation on a point-to-point basis, although Caraghiaur believes that=20\rEBT Express offers a much more efficient forum for the transfer of customer=\r=20\rdata. In addition, Caraghiaur reiterated that no proprietary or competitive=\r=20\rinformation would be accessible between any parties other than the LDC=20\rand energy supplier involved in the exchange.\r Interestingly, Toronto Hydro and Ontario Power may be competitors when=20\rthe Ontario market opens next year. Toronto Hydro Corp. owns Toronto=20\rHydro-Electric=20\rSystem Limited, a regulated electricity distribution system, and Toronto=20\rHydro Energy Services, a competitive energy service company. Ontario Power=\r=20\rGeneration is an electricity generating company, so Toronto Hydro and Ontar=\rio=20\rPower will be competing on the retail level to acquire energy supply=20\rcontracts=20\rwith lucrative customers. And rumor has it that venerable retail giant=20\rSears is also taking a look into becoming an energy retailer in Canada=20\rnext year. As Canada continues to deregulate and attract energy suppliers,=\r=20\rExcelergy anticipates that the EBT Express could serve a national market.\r =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\rFor a an in-depth perspective on the market potential of distributed=20\rtechnologies,=20\rSCIENTECH is offering Stephens Inc.'s (Investment Banker) 97-page report,=\r=20\r \"Powering the Digital Economy\" on its Website at:=20\rhttp:///www.consultrci.com/web/infostore.nsf/Product-Preview/UtilityAdvisor=\r=20\r free for a limited time only.=20\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\r SCIENTECH is pleased to provide you with your free, daily IssueAlert.

My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.   Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.   Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.   We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.Thanks!John Sherriff(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.   In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:   all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.   So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.Please communicate this policy to your staff.Michael Brown\n"

Obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government.

I reiterated to him that we would not normally entertain such a large deal without a significant commercial transaction (or series of transactions) and that the size of the opportunity set currently in front of us only justified discussing the smaller marketing deal as indicated in Steve's email.   Stark pressed to know what value we wanted to see in the set of AOL/TWX/Turner/CNN deals that are underway currently.   He was clear in stating that if we had a number in mind, he could push other parts of the organization to direct business our way sufficient to meet our needs to justify a larger sponsorship.   I declined to give him a value, but I think we should discuss this in some detail.   I'll get in touch to set something up.Stephen DowdEnron Broadband Services(713)345-7219 - Office(713)858-88867 - Mobile\n"

Immediate changes include the following:* Eliminate requirement that three utilities - Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Power and SoCal Edison - must sell all of their power to and buy all their power from the state Power Exchange (PX). * Require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead markets to reduce chronic underscheduling of load and generation and over-reliance on the ISO's real-time imbalance market to meet supply. FERC also proposed a penalty charge for scheduling deviations in excess of 5 percent of hourly load requirements. * Temporary modification of the single-price auction so bids above $150 MWh cannot set the market clearing price paid to all bidders. * Establish independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the California Power Exchange (PX) and Independent System Operator (ISO). * Create congestion management design proposal. * Establish generation inter-connection procedures. * Explore alternatives to the single price auction by the ISO and PX. * Develop market rules to ensure sufficient supply is available to meet load and reserve requirements. FERC also approved changes to protect wholesale customers from unreasonable rates during the time it will take to adopt longer-term market remedies. The following price mitigation measures will remain in effect until Dec. 31, 20002: * Single-price auctions for all sales in the ISO and PX markets at or below $150 MWh. The single price would be used for all load which clears below this amount in the auction. * If an auction does not clear below the $150 MWh level, suppliers who choose to bid above $150 would be paid their price bid. In other words, the highest bid of the day, if above $150 per MWh, would no longer be the clearing price paid by all. * Sellers receiving above $150 per MWh would be required to report their bids to FERC on a weekly basis and provide certain cost information to the agency. * The ISO and PX would be required to report monthly information on such bids, allowing FERC to monitor competitive conditions and assure just and reasonable rates. Sellers would be subject to potential refund liability but no lower than their marginal or opportunity cost if FERC finds non-competitive conditions. The potential refund liability would extend the full 24 months it would take to implement the market reforms.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n"

One question you need to think about is how their decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to California's spot market.   The way it reports the market clearing price will change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to clear the market for all bids.   So, if we are using this as a reference price in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.---"

      "body": "\nYou had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom Donahue regarding increasing Enron's contribution to the US Chamber to $1000,000.   I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and wanted you to know why.I have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.   Donahue has done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, both in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.   My reservation about the Chamber is that they won't take a stand on something which is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it will alienate a vocal few.   Electric restructuring was a key example of this.   There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but instead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they decided to have a \"process\".   Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to participate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it came time to vote.   The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform (with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).   Afterwards, the federal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not exclusively the Chamber's fault).Unfortunately, Tom's forceful and competitive approach when it comes to raising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a few members will be upset.   For Enron it's a bit like paying $1000,000 for a veto right.   The only things the organization pushes for are the things everyone agrees on in the business community --- eg China PNTR and lower corporate taxes --- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and things we will add our separate voice to in any event).   As I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging conventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating incumbents.   Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some members of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with us.   They represent the status quo in the business community.   Tom is an extremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the business community.   A voice which stands for moving business to the next level, not just protecting its current position.Having said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) has been useful to us in the past.   In previous years, Donahue himself has intervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.   As a consequence, I have asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members at a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access to their international activities.   I suggested something in the $25,000 range.   That's why they are approaching you (they want us to double our current dues to $1000,000).Currently, I am inclined to just withdraw from Chamber membership, but I plan to defer to Linda Robertson.   I am interested in your insights, or, if you prefer, you can simply refer them to Linda or me.\n"

I hope that I have given you most of the informationyou need to understand our concept and to be able to discuss it with yourcolleagues. We agreed that on my return to the UK I would set out how Enronmight be involved at this stage and be one of the first US firms to pioneerthe idea and become a GoodCorporation network member able to display theGoodCorporation trademark and start conversing with other members. Thosemembers could be private companies, public sector entities or governmentdepartments, trade associations, NGOs etc.As we discussed the GoodCorporation Charter and processes are nearcompletion . We are in the process of starting our pilot verifications whichwill be done by PwC, KPMG, Ernst &amp; Young, Intertek, SGS and BureauVeritas.We are also setting up an Accreditation Body ( which is beingmodelled on the Forestry Stewardship Council)   to oversee the annualverification process. The pilot programme provides companies with an excellent opportunity to havea low risk way of trying out the process and seeing if it works in theirorganisation. They can submit the whole or a small part of the organisation.Pilot companies pay for the verifiers' time only and the verifiers aregiving their time at cost ($750/ day.) The pilot itself will take the formof a preliminary scoping meeting in which the verifier will take the companythrough the evidence (policies and procedures) that need to be in place inorder to pass the GoodCorporation charter. The meeting will decide who needsto be interviewed, in which locations and therefore the number of daysinvolved. As the emphasis is on verifying policies and the way they areimplemented in the workplace rather than a full scale audit of impact, thenumber of days involved should be relatively limited.   During the actualverification, the verifier will check for the evidence by reviewingdocumentation provided by the company, in addition to a series of meetingswith the relevant people, such as the HR Director, Environmental Manager,Finance Directors and customer-facing staff. Assuming it is successful, thepiloted part of the company can then become a member of the network if theyso choose. It would be great to have Enron involved in this early piloting. Given yourcurrent policies and ethics I wouild be surprised if the charter posed anyreal problem for you . It could also be a useful supply chain tool for youto encourage your suppliers not only to say they behave in the manner youwish them to behave but also demonstrate this behaviour to you and theoutside world in a transparent fashion. Please get back to me if you requireany further clarification and of course I and my colleagues would bedelighted to meet whoever else you need to get involved before a decision ismade.Again, many thanks for your time and I was delighted that you wereenthusiastic about our concept.With very best regardsVicky PryceChairman, GoodCorporation\n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nI'm looking forward to your discussion regarding the \"reregulation threat\" at the next meeting.   Below are some of my observations:While it's premature to say we have an energy crisis, we are witnessing the triple threat of high summer gasoline prices, spiking electricity prices, and high natural gas prices for the upcoming heating season (I'll send along some of the data).There is at least the potential for this to become a prominent national political issue:   Gore has focussed relentlessly on Bush's ties to \"big oil\" (which includes us by the way, though we produce nary a drop); and Congressional republicans have blamed the current administration for failing to have a coherent energy policy (though, at least so far, the dominant characteristic of the administration's policy has been a republicanesque reliance on the market).   Notwithstanding the issue's potential to become political fodder and its prominence in the popular press, many Americans seem blissfully ignorant, at least on the electricity issue.   We did some focus group testing recently in Southern California --- a mere 15 minutes from the epicenter of the San Diego price quakes --- and most people knew nothing about it.   So, while the issue has the potential for political traction, it may not have caught on yet (except in places like San Diego and New York city.The reaction in California has been to call for government intervention in electricity markets.   Investigations of out of state \"price gougers and profiteers\" have been undertaken and wholesale and retail price caps have been put in place.   They have not worked --- at least in wholesale markets.   Suppliers are deciding to site plants elsewhere and when prices are high elsewhere in the West, power flows out of California to those other markets.   Ironically, though I can't explain it in classical economic terms, the setting of rate caps in wholesale markets has had the effect of pulling prices up to the capped levels in offpeak times when there is more than enough supply.   For the most part, though, the caps and the other political reactions have been somewhat muted: policy makers have been reluctant to throw the deregulation plan out and start over, and the retail price caps have been relatively narrow ... so far.Outside of California, the authors of other states' deregulation plans have distinguished their proposals from California's.   Regulators and legislators from such diverse places as Connecticut, Texas and Alberta have gone out of their way to defend their plans and explain why \"California won't happen here.\"   For the most part, then, the reaction to California has been positive from Enron's perspective in states that have already deregulated.   There does remain some threat that aspects of the state plans (e.g. utility plant divestiture) may be postponed or cancelled.   The story is a bit more grim in states that were considering deregulation but have not gone forward with their plans:   I think it's off the agenda in most places.   The fact that most of the major markets (about 70% of total electric revenue) are already deregulated/deregulating is a blessing in that regard.At the federal level there has been a combination of the \"burn the village in order to save it\" approach   --- allow some price caps to remove the pressure to reverse the whole deregulation program --- and a more positive call for comprehensive reform.All in all, I believe we're OK so far and we need to look at this as an opportunity:   business is booming;   we sell protection from price volatility and the need for such protection is now plastered over the front pages of major newspapers.   On the public policy front we need to convert the controversy into productive action.   Our target has been FERC --- they are somewhat removed from the white hot rhetoric in California and they are a single commissioner's vote away from taking action to further open the market.Enron's response:   Initially we hoped to feed information into industry groups and let them carry the message; our concern was that Enron --- a company which was in and out of the residential market in Cal. --- would not make the most attractive champion for the open market message.   We hoped that the new generators in Cal would take up the mantle.   It's fair to say that they fumbled the ball:   they are now locked in a pitched battle with the utilities over price caps and fall all to easily into the out of state profiteer label ... standing between Aunt Millie and rate relief.   They were also extremely slow out of the blocks with a more productive message.   We are now working the issue directly.   We are working the issue on a number of levels: 1) PR - we have good contacts in the press and have talked to numerous reporters and editorial writers.   As time goes on, the information and reporting has gotten somewhat better.   2)   Govt relations - we have been pushing for power plant siting legislation in California (the market wants to build capacity but the government won't let it).   This may be the best environment we'll ever see for streamlining the permitting process.   Also, in typical Enron fashion, we put a deal on the table.   We offered to sell power to the local utility at a price which would enable them to lock in stable rates for their customers at below current rates.   Our offer was followed by nine others and we tried to make something of the fact that the market was offering better solutions than California politicians.   SDG&amp;E dropped the ball, unfortunately.   Instead of seizing the opportunity, they ended up going along with a government granted rate discount which will cause them to accrue a massive deferral account.   At the federal level we are contacting members, the DOE and FERC.   Here we are making a push for FERC action to finish \"leveling the playing field\" in wholesale markets so power can get from where it is to where its needed.   Additionally, we are developing a prepackaged system (including software) for nondiscriminatory open access (to take away any lingering excuses or delays).   3) Overall messaging --- we have been working with a well known political pollster to check our messages for their resonance at the grassroots level.   As we hone these messages we will be using them in the fora we are currently working.Overall, we have more opportunity than risk in the current environment, but capitalizing on those opportunities continues to be a long shot.An intersting rhetorical challenge for us is this:   much of the problem in power markets is blamed on high upstream fuel prices, particularly natural gas.   The gas market is open and structured pretty much the way we are advocating for electricity, so how can we maintain that the problem in power markets is an absence of open markets when the most open commodity market on the planet (natural gas) is producing such outsized prices?   The answer is somewhat complicated and therefore a bit unsatisfactory in the current debate:   gas prices are still lower in real terms than they were pre-deregulation;   long term prices are also lower than historical levels ( the curve is \"backwardated\" (sp?) meaning that prices in later years are lower than today so you can buy gas for 3 years at a price lower than current spot prices); and the economy is booming and driving up demand for basic inputs (this begs the question: why didn't the market react sooner and avoid the spike?).   When all else fails, a big part of the problem can be blamed on OPEC.   We haven't had this thrown at us yet, but we are trying to anticipate it and have answers at the ready. This is just the tip of the iceberg.   The issue is a great example of the intersection of our business interests with public policy debates and should promote a lively discussion when we get together.   Let me know if there is anything else you need.\n"

      "body": "\nAs you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this summer.   There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).   But, the soundbite on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the grid.   The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of re-regulation.At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective:How great of a threat is re-regulation.How might we respond.How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics?\n"

I serve as Chairman of the VMA's EnergyResources Committee which will be responsible for the seminar and theday-long agenda it will entail.As I explained, depending upon the availability of Mr. Skilling or anotherkey individual, the VMA   is offering Enron an opportunity to participate inits seminar in an important way.   We seek to have Enron speak on thesubject of the developing competitive market and how that market may beaccessible and beneficial to VMA's member manufacturers which include many,if not most, of the large companies residing in Virginia.   The purpose ofthe seminar is entirely educational, as customers in Virginia will be able,under the terms of the Electric Utility Industry Restructuring Act passedin 1999, to choose their supplier of electricity as early as January 1,20002, and by no later than January 1, 20003.   The subject is becoming a highpriority for VMA members, given the prominence of energy issues todaygenerally, and the imminence of the date when choice will be available toVirginia customers.We envision that Enron's message could be encouraging for VMA members whotoday hear much about the dilemma in California (another seminarparticipant will speak on the status of restructuring initiatives inCalifornia and other states) and understandably wonder about the prospectsfor successful competition and effective choice in Virginia.   Enron couldhopefully explain how market benefits might accrue to manufacturers oncethe day of choice arrives, touching on Enron's online trading platform,aggregation possibilities (an alternative which the VMA, as an umbrellaorganization, is considering), and related topics.The seminar will begin at 8:30am and conclude at 4:30pm, with the possibleEnron presentation beginning immediately following lunch at 1:000pm.   Weexpect good attendance on the part of VMA members, and plan to offerattendance opportunities to regulatory commission personnel, legislatorsand others who have been closely involved   with the development of theVirginia restructuring model as it has evolved over the past five years orso.I will appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience, and againthank you for your assistance.   I will be happy to discuss the particularswith you or anyone else, should that be helpful, and can be reached atAEP's state office in Richmond at 804-698-555111.\n"

That would putpressure on regulators to orchestrate amultibillion-dollar public bailout, similar to the \"toobig to fail''' response that in the past pushedgovernments to rescue banks.Such a scenario is quietly being discussed by bond-ratingconcerns that recently reduced their credit outlooks forPacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., a unit of San Francisco-basedPG&amp;E Corp., and Southern California Edison, a unit ofEdison International of Rosemead, Calif. Bond- ratingconcerns say they aren't sure how much additional debtcan be borne by the two affected utilities before theywill have difficulty paying their bills.Probe of California Power Prices Begins, but New PlantsAren't Seen as Solution (Sept. 111)Los Angeles Utility Is Benefitting, Surprisingly, FromDeregulation (Sept. 6)California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Electricity Costs(Sept. 1)\"If this is just a seasonal aberration, the utilities canget through it,\" says Lori Woodland, analyst for FitchIBCA. \"If it goes on for six or nine months, it's a veryserious situation.\" Adds A.J. Sabatelle, senior creditofficer at Moody's Investors Service Inc.: \"At somepoint, you have a financial crisis.\"The utilities say they are having no difficulty meetingexpenses and don't envision problems in servicing theirdebts. But they are vigorously lobbying state and federalregulators to change the rules of the game, hopingsomehow to raise rates to make up for the shortfall. TheCalifornia utilities' experience may be a harbinger ofwhat could happen in other states where wholesale powerprices have surpassed the amount that utilities areallowed to charge their ratepayers.For now, utilities are making ends meet by going to thefinancial markets to borrow money. PG&amp;E, a giant utilitythat serves one out of every 20 Americans, is seekingapproval to increase its debt capacity by $1.4 billion.It is borrowing $2000 million, while Edison is tapping$250 million from the commercial paper market. \"This isgoing to be a long, tough road,\" says Jim Scilacci, chieffinancial officer for Southern California Edison.Today's situation represents a complete turnabout fromwhat was expected when California deregulated its energymarket on March 31, 19998, which opened electricitypricing to competition. California tried to give itsutilities a competitive edge nationally by deregulatingfaster than other states and by creating a mechanism toallow investor-owned utilities, such as PG&amp;E and Edison,to quickly pay down debts incurred to serve customersunder the old regulatory system.To do this, the state legislature set retail rates athigh levels, which, at first, generated fat surpluses forthe utilities. As the money piled up, utilities used itto pay down debts for generation facilities that wereotherwise unprofitable in the new deregulated world. Bythe end of this June, PG&amp;E and Edison together hadcollected more than $12 billion and were on track tofinish paying down debts well ahead of the March 31,20002, deadline set by the legislature. At that point,rate freezes were to end and retail prices were tofluctuate with the market.But all that went out the window in June, when wholesalepower prices surged, topping the rates the utilities wereallowed to charge retail customers. Average prices atstate-sanctioned energy markets were four to five timesthe prices of a year earlier, and three to four times thelevel utilities could charge customers.The accumulated shortfall has been so enormous at PG&amp;E,that analysts expect its deficit to exceed $3 billion byOct. 31, more than half its shareholder equity of $5.7billion, which is defined as assets minus liabilities.Southern California Edison finished August with a deficitof $2 billion, equivalent to almost two-thirds its networth of $3.2 billion. The utilities, though they havebeen accumulating deficits, aren't required to reportthese as losses on their earnings statements.That leaves utilities in a bind. They want to end therate freeze to be able to pass on the real cost ofelectricity to consumers. But should the freeze endbefore the statutory deadline of 20002, they getclobbered. That is because they will immediately have tobook a loss on their power-purchase deficits. What'smore, they can't use the proceeds from plannedpower-plant sales to cover those losses; instead, shouldthe freeze end, they will be obliged to refund some ofthe proceeds to ratepayers. In PG&amp;E's case, the refundscould total $5000 million, while in Edison's case, theamount is $254 million.Publicly at least, utility executives insist a mechanismwill be found to let them recoup the money spent onelectricity.Consumer advocates are gearing up for the fight. NettieHoge, executive director for San Francisco consumer groupUtility Reform Network, says ratepayers shouldn't end upfooting the bill for a deal cut by utilities thatbenefited them before prices shot up.Utility executives are now distancing themselves from thelegislation that got them into such a mess, which wasdrafted with their assistance. PG&amp;E Chairman Robert Glynnsays it is best not to \"overanalyze\" the \"old deal.\"Instead, he says, regulators and legislators should sitdown with utilities and construct a new agreement, since\"it's in the broad interests of the state not to havecritical energy infrastructure look like a leper.\"Mr. Glynn says the current deal offers \"mutually assureddestruction\" to both utilities and ratepayers. Somethingmust be done, he says, or consumers throughout most ofthe state will experience \"a San Diego-style rate shock.\"The utility serving that city, San Diego Gas &amp; ElectricCo., ended its freeze a year ago and began passingwholesale power costs directly through to ratepayers.Legislators intervened this summer, however, andtemporarily capped retail rates when monthly power billsnearly tripled. The utility, a unit of Sempra Energy, isalso accumulating a deficit as a result.So long as banks and bond markets believe the utilitieswill be repaid, they will be able to borrow, analystssay. \"Until we hear politicians of consequence stateotherwise, our position is that we believe the utilitieswill be made whole,\" says Richard Cortright, a directorat Standard &amp; Poor's corporate ratings group.But that opinion could change if it looks like theutilities will have to swallow a big loss. The result:lower credit ratings that would raise borrowing costs andcould trigger a downward spiral. \"You're talking abouttop-rated companies, though,\" said Ms. Woodland of FitchIBCA. \"To get to insolvency, a lot would have to happen.\"In the meantime, utilities are doing all they can tocontrol the hemorrhaging. They have gotten authority fromregulators to buy more power under long-term contracts atfixed prices, reducing their vulnerability to spot-marketvolatility. And they have petitioned federal regulatorsto declare California's market so badly flawed thatgenerators should be denied market pricing and, even,ordered to pay refunds.Nevertheless, several forces are working against them.Although they can sign bilateral contracts, prices remainhigh for those as well. What's more, they can't buy lesspower than their customers need. If they don't buyenough, the California Independent System Operator, theorganization responsible for reliability, will step inand make purchases for them and send them the bill.Perhaps the biggest problem facing PG&amp;E and Edison,though, is one of timing. The California legislature isout of session until December, and regulators haven'teven really started to address the issue formally. In themeantime, the utilities' deficit is growing by tens ofmillions of dollars daily.Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com\n"

In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890 passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their \"rate reduction bonds\" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.---"

Note109:42am EST 26-Feb-01 ABN AMRO Inc. (Ford,Daniel F. 212/258-1548) CPN DYN EIX One Down Two to GoOne Down Two to GoABN AMRO --- Research NotesSubject: PowerCompanies Mentioned: CPN, DYN#, EIX, PCG, SREAnalyst:   Daniel F. Ford, CFA   212/258-1548   Po Cheng, CFA   212/258-1709===Date:   February 26, 20001---Highlights:-   On Friday (2/23), Governor Davis triumphantly announced that the State of   California and Edison International had reached an agreement in principle   for the sale of its electric transmission system as part of a financial   recovery package. He also commented that \"good progress\" was made with   Sempra Energy and \"some progress\" with PG&amp;E Corp.-   The preliminary terms of the agreement call for the State to buy Edison's   transmission system for approximately $2.76 billion (2.3x estimated book   value) and allow for the securitization of \"a substantial portion of its   undercollection\".-   In exchange, Edison would: 1) make payments of approximately $420 million   to its utility subsidiary, Southern California Edison; 2) commit the entire   output of an Edison Mission project at cost-based rates for 10 years; 3)   provide cost-based rates from native generation for another 10 years; 4)   give conservation easements on 20,000 acreas of watershed lands for 999   years; and 5) drop a pending lawsuit against the California Public   Utilities Commission.-   We view this agreement as a positive development. Based on the 2.3x   purchase price, the EPS hit from the loss of the transmission lines would   be approximately $0.10 lower than our worst case estimate (at 1.5x) of   $1.90 . The agreement, however, is not final and additional details need to   be worked out before being submitted to the legislature.-   Events to watch over the next couple of weeks include: 1) a definitive   agreement with Edison; 2) deals with PG&amp;E Corp. and Sempra Energy; 3) a   package that the legislature can accept (which could include concessions   from generators); and 4) terms that are acceptable by the FERC.-   In our opinion, the proposed deal is reasonable for EIX shareholders and   renews the hope for a resolution to the crisis. While our optimism is   tempered by the shortening timeframe, we are encouraged by the governor's   recent statements, which have been more positive than negative. As such, we   maintain our Buy ratings on Edison International and PG&amp;E Corp as well as   on the generation companies: Calpine and Dynegy.Other News:In other related news, on Friday (2/23) Edison announced that all of its bankshave agreed to extend their forbearance until March 14.Note 2 05:16pm EST 26-Feb-01 Goldman Sachs (NEWYORK) EIX PCG ACTION EIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov Davis.PCG still negotiating.Buy EIX...   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. Investment ResearchEIX agrees to deal in principle with Gov Davis.PCG still negotiating.Buy EI   *   On February 23, EIX and Governor Davis reached an agreement in principal   in which the state would agree to buy the transmission grid and allow   for recovery of a 'substantial portion' of unrecovered cost in return   for EIX refunding money from its parent to the utility and dropping   pending litigation.   This settlement appears to be a   reasonable 'shared   pain' scenario and is consistent with the 'buyout vs. bailout'   structure we have been anticipating. To be enacted the deal needs to be   finalized and approved by the EIX board and the California Legislature.   FERC also must approve the asset sale.*   EIX agreed to sell a portion of its electric transmission system to the   state of California for $2.76 billion and transfer $420 million cash to   its utility subsidiary from the parent.   In return, the state would   allow EIX to recover a substantial portion of its under-collected power   costs and drop pending litigation in which the company is pursuing rate   hikes.   If approved by the EIX board and California legislature this   agreement, in concert with passage of ABX1-1, would eliminate the   overhang that has depressed EIX shares.*   Although dependent on several factors, we believe the net impact on   earnings from the settlement will not be as high as the current EIX   stock price implies.   We believe post-settlement EPS in 20002 will likely   total at least $2.000/share, which supports a conservative valuation of   $20 share (10X '02 EPS, a 20% valuation discount to the peer group).*   Also late last week, PCG issued a press release indicating they had met   with the Governor, had submitted proposals, and discussions were   ongoing.   With the framework already established for EIX, we expect a   PCG settlement could be announced in the near future. PCG's negotiating   flexibility is limited relative to EIX because their generation rates   are lower, their under-recovered balance is higher, and the potential   cash 'refund' from parent to subsidiary being requested by the   government is probably larger.*   PCG's transmission system has a book value of roughly $1.5 billion.   At   2.3X book value, these assets could potentially be worth $3.5 billion.   Assuming a parent company to utility cash transfer proportional to the   one proposed for EIX, we estimate PCG would refund $780 million. PCG's   stock price also reflects an earnings impact more punitive than implied   by a settlement of this nature. We believe a deal like this would   support post-settlement EPS of at least $2.50/share which supports a   conservative valuation of $25/share (10X '02 eps, a 20% valuation   discount to the peer group).*   Because EIX has a 'deal in principle' the stock is trading at a premium   to PCG despite having lower potential 20002 earnings power. Those   investors who believe PCG will strike a deal that is similar in   structure and proportional to EIX's settlement should purchase PCG over   EIX at this juncture.NOTE 309:17am EST 26-Feb-01 Merrill Lynch (S.Fleishman (1) 212 4449-0926) EIX PCG UTILITIES-ELECTRIC:California: One Goes Forward, But Need All Three   ML+++ML+++ML   Merrill Lynch Global Securities Research   ML+++ML+++ML   UTILITIES - ELECTRIC   California: One Goes Forward, But Need All Three   Steven I. Fleishman (1) 212 4449-0926Reason for Report:   Governor reaches preliminary agreement with Edison; PG&amp;E upin the air; Need all 3 utilities to move forwardInvestment Highlights:o   On Friday, Governor Davis announced a preliminary agreement with EdisonInternational (EIX; D-2-2-9; $14.69) on a financial resuscitation plan.   Theplan follows the basic framework previously outlined by the Governor.o   The state will purchase Edison's transmission assets for $2.76B, or 2.3xbook value.   This would help pay off some of Edison's net $4.1B ofundercollections (a number agreed upon with the Gov.)   The remainder will berecovered through a bond financing tied to a dedicated rate component to becarved-out of Edison's rates.o   In exchange, Edison will agree to: 1) Drop the lawsuit against the PUC, 2)Invest $420M back into the utility from the parent, representing taxovercollections , and 3) Sell power from its hydro and nuclear assets at cost-based rates for the next 10 years.   Edison also agreed to sell power from itsunregulated Sunrise plant, currently under construction, at cost-based ratesfor 10 years.o   A number of uncertainties remain in Edison's deal, and it is stillpreliminary.   The exact terms and language will be very important, particularlygiven the need to issue securitization bonds.   It is impossible to provideexact earnings guidance based on this deal, but the only loss of earnings powerwould appear to come from lost transmission earnings (-$0.20-$0.25/share) andpotentially lower generation earnings depending on the terms of cost-basedrates.o   This is a significant step forward for Edison and the resolution of the CApower credit crisis.   However, it could be for naught if the other utilitiescannot work out deals.   We believe Sempra Energy (SRE; B-2-1-7; $222.10) isrelatively close, but PG&amp;E's (PCG; D-2-2-9, $13.70) talks were flailing lastweek.   We continue to see little chance that this plan can move forward andpass through the legislature unless all the utilities are on board.o   We believe PG&amp;E is willing to work a deal within this framework.   However,the simple problem is that PCG's undercollection numbers are much bigger.   AtYE 2000, PCG's net undercollection was more than $5B and we believe this mayhave reached $7B by the end of January.   Selling the transmission for 2.3x bookwould provide only $3.5B, leaving the other half to be recovered though thededicated rate component/securitization.   It may be that the only way thenumbers can work is with a rate increase.Despite the significant hurdles that remain, we believe the momentum toward aconstructive outcome is improving.   To that end, we maintain our Accumulateratings on EIX and PCG for high rate accounts.\n"

Enron was the only marketer involved in the process.   While we weighed in all the issues, there are a number of items that but for our persistence would not have been included in the final agreement.   These items include the following:1.   Native load language2.   Competitive metering and billing for industrial and large commercials as of day one, with other customers following no later than within the next four years.3.   Addition of competitive bidding for default service at end of 5 years.4.   Change from functional separation to a requirement to corporately separate as soon as possible but no later than within the next five years.5.   Strong codes of conduct that form the base for more detailed rulemaking.   (A special thanks to Lara Leibman for her assistance).Below is a summary of the entire settlement:1.   All customers can exercise choice beginning January 1, 20001.2.   All utilities including IOU's, munies and coops can opt in.   APS has committed to opt in whereas AEP is not because it did not get any stranded cost and it also did not get a guarantee of full recovery of all costs resulting from the environmental lawsuits against them irrespective of their financial condition.   3.   Competitive metering and billing as described above.4.   Generation is deregulated.5.   PSC continues jurisdiction over implemention, rate unbundling, reliability, codes of conduct, supplier licensing, construction of transmission lines and eminent domain authority.6.   Native load language - Requires utilities to provide service to affiliated and unaffiliated suppliers only under the applicable distribution tariffs and proformatransmission tariffs.7.   RTO's - Each utility must join a FERC approved RTO or its equivlent by no later than 1/1/03;   best efforts requirement to eliminate pancaking by 1/1/05 if IOU's are in separate RTO's.8.   Competitive bidding process for   default service customers at end of year 5 for remainder of transition period.9.   Rate unbundling requirement10. Rates capped for first 4 years with any FERC change in transmission being applied as an offset to distribution.Rates continue to be regulated through the 10th year with the rate gradually increasing during the second six years for the residential and small commercial customers.   For the large commercial and industrial customers, the rate regulation ends 12/31/07.111.   A rate stabilization deferral fund is created to facilitate the transition to competition in years 111, 12 and 13, under which APS must contribute $56.75 million and AEP must contribute $81 million to be used as an offset to the prices paid by small residential and commercial default customers.12.   Large commercial and industrial customers receive for the first 4 years, rate decreases in an amount to be determined by the Commission for AEP customers and 3% for APS customers.   The rate decrease is allocated to distribution.13.   No stranded costs (either generating or regulatory assets) for AEP or APS, however APS gets a ten year PURPA surcharge starting at 2.6 mills per kwh in year one and declining to .75 mills per kwh in the last two years.14.   Usual licensing requirements.   (AEP fought for the right to have a second tier of licensing where they would have the ability to certify marketers but we defeated that).15. Corporate separation and codes of conduct as described above.   16. Consumer protection and education requirements typically found in other plans.17.

This is a summary of our message from this morning for you to send on or discuss with Keene.   I hope this is helpful.   ScottWhat's importantGive solvency to the utilities by guaranteeing no banckruptcy against the generation assets of the utilities.   Guarantees to be recovered, if needed, through surcharges over 10 years.   This should give the process time for thoughtful solutions.   Ending the rate freeze now will give the utilities an undeserved windfall (3.5b alone related to nuclear assets in year 20001).There should be thoughtful process to determine: i) how to keep deregulation going, ii) how existing generation assets should be used, ii) what are the value of existing assets, iv) when is the appropriate time for customers to be exposed to the market, and v) what kind of market structure would be appropriate going forward. Customers should not be dumped into the market, now or in the next year, while it is extremely illiquid due to many errors of the utilities.There should not be retroactive rate making (the negative ctc should be paid until at least the rate freeze is ended)All customers should be treated equally with respect to existing generation assets that they paid for for the past 4-30 years.There should be a special hearing called to debate demand side prospects (ie. curtailment etc.)From: Steven J Kean@ENRON on 12/26/2000 07:01 PMTo: Marty Sunde/HOU/EEES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EEES@EES, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@Enron, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.

This action comes only a day before FERC and other witnesses will   testify on the Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation before the Senate Energy Committee, Gov. Davis and FERC will   testify before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on Wednesday, and the House Financial Services Committee joins the fray with a hearing on the California energy situation on Wednesday.   The latter committee will probably base its jurisdiction over some aspect of energy policy on a number of factors, including its jurisdiction over presidential economic emergency powers.   The committee staff has in the past expressed interest in derivatives and other financial aspects of energy trading and markets.   We are checking now to quietly determine whether these issues will be on Wednesday's agenda.\n"

For the speaking engagement next Wednesday, I would like you to focus upon the Enron strategic model of virtual integration of market forces in the evolution of energy development.   Wyoming represents a huge material resource base and the commission is charged with the development and promotion of such.   But the Governor's message is that we cannot see ourselves as producers and exporters in the traditional sense.   We will continue to have the status of a colony if we do not recognize the new dynamics of how these market places are evolving.   If you set the stage with a presentation of Enron strategy, then we will discuss how a state, with its agencies and auathority can play a role in this evolution.   I have set your time for 45 minutes, which can include a short Qand A period.   But your message can be as succint as you can make it and get the point across.   You may have to present the Enron case a number of different ways, but the Governor will give you latitude to make the point.   You will be welcome to participate in a following panel which will address role playing by the state and the commission.   Plan to join us for lunch.   If you need more detail, let me know.   Thanks!   Stephen\n"

In addition, Ken Lay is slated to be in New York on June 15.   We are trying to get appointments for him with Senator Schumer and Rep. Rangel.   If we are unsuccessful in lining up anything for him in NY, we have \"penciled in\" Ken on Chairman Bingaman's calendar for 10:30 am that day, here in DC.   Ken is in NY Thursday night for an award, and I understand is planning to be in NY Friday night, but his calendar at present is clear during the day.   If we don't get the Schumer appointment in NY, I will being asking you to see if Ken is willing to make a quick trip during the day on Friday to DC to see Bingaman and, if we can get him, Leader Daschle.

We are drafting a \"pitch letter\" to send out by the end of this weekvia blast e-mail and fax to the following media lists: 1)capitol press corpsreporters; 2) mainstream media reporters working the energy crisis; and 3)trade media.   We may also outreach to our editorial board list as well.   Ourpitch will be focused on what it will really mean for small business and C&amp;Icustomers to lose the option of retail choice at a time when they aresuffering the financial hardships of skyrocketing energy bills. We willaddress the effect on California's future business climate if direct accessis not preserved through legislation that corrects the problems that AB1xcaused for retail choice.   And finally, we will address the point that nomatter what direction California ultimately takes, direct access must be apart of the solution.   Reporters have seen the recent polls which illustrateCalifornia businesses' concerns with the path the state is on so this is aprime opportunity to build on those recent media stories.2.   We recommend a conference call with AReM and the Direct AccessCoalition on Friday to address the questions and suggestions on the presstrategy outlined here.3.   Determine which people in the Direct Access Coalition are willing totake media calls on behalf of the coalition.Next Week1.   Follow up with key reporters who received the pitch letter.2.   Evaluate the language of SB 27x and determine whether there will be anopportunity to hold a news conference with Sen. Bowen in the near future.Monitor movement at the PUC and determine whether a press conference may beeffective in this arena, or whether we may need to use the option of sendinga media alert before the March 7 hearing, followed by a news release afterthe hearing.3.   Place op-eds (opinion pieces) with key newspapers.4.   Contact radio news shows and TV public affairs shows (i.e. CaliforniaCapitol Week and the California Report) to securemedia interviews.5.   Revise the SB 27x fact sheet (attached) to reflect the realities ofthe amended language in SB 27x. What We Need From You1.   If you are willing to speak with the media, or you havecustomers/clients with a positive direct access story to tell, pleaserespond to this email as soon as you can with your name and contactinformation.2.   If you have draft op-eds written that need to be placed with newspaperson behalf of your association and the broader coalition, we are willing todo this for the you.3.   If you have colleagues and/or staff that are already working with themedia it would be helpful to have this information so that we cancollaborate as necessary.The Documents Below&lt;   All documents are works in progress, so if you have suggestions on&lt; potential changes, please feel free to share them with us.&lt;Thank you.&lt;   &lt;&lt;AREM Fact Sheet 222120001 ver 222720001.doc&lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;Q&amp;A @ ESP Reversions 222701.doc&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;AReM FAQ FINAL3.doc&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;AREM Fact&lt; FINAL3.doc&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Tracy Fairchild&lt; Account Supervisor&lt; Edelman Public Relations Worldwide&lt; (916) 4442-23331&lt; tracy.fairchild@edelman.com&lt; - AREM Fact Sheet 222120001 ver 222720001.doc - Q&amp;A @ ESP Reversions 222701.doc - AReM FAQ FINAL3.doc - AREM Fact FINAL3.doc\n"

The numbers are spread across three different ranges :- 713 853 xx ( 63000 numbers )- 713 345 xx ( 10,000 numbers )- 713 646 xx   ( 5,000 numbers )The proposal is to take a 70,000 number range to cover current and future requirements. The benefits are : - less confusion to Enron customers and internal users - sufficient numbers to allow Enron to expand in the downtown area - increased capacity from one   range of numbers to cater for Fax or multimedia applications - have a new identity to fall in line with '''One Enron''' philosophyDue to the high utilization of DID numbers in the downtown area, we will not get a (713) area code allocation, and we will be looking at the new ( 832) area code.We have been investigating (832) 363(ENE) XX as the range, however this cannot be guaranteed.To take this forward, I require high level approval of the scheme, we will then pressure the suppliers and regulatory committee's to meet Enron's requirements.\n"

Gray Davis to provide immediate relief.&lt;&lt;   The state's major utilities should be free to buy power&lt; wherever they can get it. They should not have to buy exclusively from the&lt; Power Exchange, the Pasadena-based power pool that was set up by the 19998&lt; deregulation to achieve auction-based prices for roughly 80% of the&lt; state's electricity.&lt;&lt;   Approval should be expedited for adding smaller generating&lt; plants that supply power at times of peak demand. That could alleviate a&lt; tight supply-demand situation over the next year or two while larger&lt; plants are built.&lt;&lt;   Long term, the state needs to speed up the approval process&lt; for building new electricity plants. The state also should force utilities&lt; to invest in the still-regulated system of power transmission lines, which&lt; now has weaknesses in the San Diego and San Francisco areas.&lt;&lt;   Perhaps the most glaring fact about California's electricity&lt; problem is how few companies have stepped up to supply power to this&lt; enormous market, the nation's biggest. Only 15 or so suppliers, including&lt; federal agencies, the state's own utilities, municipal companies and&lt; private generating firms, supply power to California's system.&lt;&lt;   By contrast, Pennsylvania, which has an electricity market&lt; less than 12% the size of California's, has 130 separate suppliers of&lt; electricity today, reports John Quain, chairman of that state's Public&lt; Utility Commission.&lt;&lt;   It's no coincidence that Pennsylvania has seen monthly&lt; electric bills drop 3% on average since deregulation. \"It's worked out&lt; terrifically,\" Quain says.&lt;&lt;   What did California do wrong? It allowed the state's major&lt; utilities---Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern California Edison and San&lt; Diego Gas &amp; Electric---to recover 1000% of their unrecovered or \"stranded\"&lt; costs for nuclear and hydroelectric plants and for past power purchase&lt; schemes mandated by the California legislature to encourage alternative&lt; sources of energy.&lt;&lt;   Then California's legislators told the utilities to sell&lt; their conventional power plants to private generating companies, all of&lt; which would sell their power to a central Power Exchange.&lt;&lt;   The California scheme was flawed, at once over-regulated and&lt; yet commercially clueless in not foreseeing trouble from a single power&lt; pool fed by only a handful of suppliers.&lt;&lt;   How did Pennsylvania do it? It allowed the state's utilities&lt; to recover no more than 67% of their stranded costs for nuclear&lt; plants---reasoning that company shareholders should accept some of the risk&lt; of their investments. And rather than set up a central power exchange, the&lt; state allowed its utilities and newcomers to the state's electric system&lt; to compete for business.&lt;&lt;   Competition, after all, is what deregulation is supposed to&lt; encourage. And competition is not happening in California.&lt;&lt;   It should be noted that the summer is relatively cool in the&lt; East this year and extraordinarily hot throughout the West. All the&lt; Western states are suffering electricity problems. That's another reason&lt; for California's trouble.&lt;&lt;   Normally, 28% of California's electricity comes from U.S.&lt; and Canadian government systems and from utilities in Oregon and&lt; Washington, Nevada and Arizona. But this year, because of lower&lt; hydroelectric supplies and higher demand from booming economies in those&lt; other states, power for California is in shorter supply and more expensive&lt; when the state can get it. Now there are accusations that some suppliers&lt; to California have taken advantage of their market leverage to extract&lt; premium prices for power.&lt;&lt;   There's nothing illegal in angling for a better price or in&lt; using futures markets and other trading techniques, as some generators may&lt; have done. If any stepped over the line to illegal collusion, federal and&lt; other investigations will determine the facts.&lt;&lt;   But who gave the generators the market leverage to exploit&lt; us? The California regulators, legislators and utilities did. Told to sell&lt; their generating plants in 19998, the utilities sold dozens of plants in&lt; package deals of two and three to single buyers. They received premium&lt; prices from buyers such as AES Corp., Duke Energy, Southern Co. Reliant&lt; Energy, Dynegy and NRG. The premiums were paid for the market leverage&lt; that multiple plants afforded the buyers.&lt;&lt;   Nobody in the utilities reckoned that they were handing&lt; market leverage to potential commercial adversaries. Nobody in the&lt; Legislature or the regulatory staffs reckoned that the central Power&lt; Exchange could be held up by market leverage.&lt;&lt;   As outsiders often say about Californians: \"Maybe it's the&lt; sunshine makes them slow.\"&lt;&lt;   (END)&lt;&lt;   05:23 EDT August 25, 2000&lt;   Copyright , 2000 Times Mirror Company&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n"

I live in Garden Oaks (which is located off of the 610 North Loop between Shepherd and Yale near the Heights).   Our neighborhood was built in the early 1940's, and the city put in open drainage (which is basically ditches in the front of all the properties).   Over the past 60 years the drains have filled in and leveled which is preventing the water from flowing correctly to the sewers, and this in turn causes minor flooding and BIG headaches.   My address is 236 W. 30th Street and the area of 30th Street I am asking the city to regrade is between Ashland and Yale (approximately 2,5000 feet).   I have been calling the City of Houston Public Works Department 713-247-1000 for about the last 4 years (generally once a month) to ask them to please come out and regrade our ditches.   (The Public Works Department only has records over the last year because they changed their computer system and lost many files including mine.)   For the last year or so I have been receiving a more positive response when I call which is: \"This is a Code 1 priority and will schedule as work load allows.\"   Although this response is encouraging, I still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears.   Kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might help expedite this work request.   I would be extremely grateful if there is anything you could do to help me and my neighbors.

At that time, you had offered to get me in touch withsomeone in the Finance Division (?) at Enron to discuss similar topics.   Iam sorry to bother you with matters such as this, but I am still veryinterested in a position with Enron and would like to follow through onthis offer, if you are still willing.   As an aside, another contact gaveme the name of Rob Bradley and suggested that I get in touch with him.   Idon't know if that is who you had in mind, or not.I am moving my wife to Houston next week, and will be available to meetany time from Friday, August 4 until Thursday, August 10.   After that, Ileave for a conference in Seattle, but will back in Houston for one day onThursday, August 17th.As for my timetable (which at the time you had told me to keep youapprised of), I will continue in my position at K-State for the Fallsemester.   After that, I'm a free man.   I have a couple of academic offersfor temporary positions in the Spring, one at Rice and one at UT-Austin.The latter is very appealing, but would require my absence from homeduring the weeks.   As such, I am still wide open beginning in January.In spite of the fact that I awoke at 3:30AM in order to get to theairport the day that I met Jim Steffes and you, I got a lot out of ourmeeting.   I was very impressed with Enron and what you had to say, and amhopeful about future prospects with the company.   I remain very interestedin a future position at Enron, and perhaps in Public and GovernmentAffairs (I hope I have that right).Thank you for everything.   I hope that you had a nice vacation.Sincerely,Mike Sadler***Michael A.

One of the majorbeneficiaries of the plan would be a power company notorious for pollutingthe atmosphere. To close the circle, the company has used the Gore adviseras a paid consultant.In polishing up his energy program, Gore played a variation on his LosAngeles acceptance speech's populistic attack on certain categories ofbusiness that have broken no law. This time, the target was the energyindustry (\"Big Oil\"), assailed for benefitting from the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries' manipulation of oil prices. But Gore is noacross-the-board enemy of corporate America. He always takes care offriends. While positioning himself as the foe of Big Oil, he emerges as thefriend of Big Power.In that category is American Electric Power, based in Columbus, Ohio, andone of the Midwest's biggest supplier of coal-generated power. AEP, sued bythe Environmental Protection Agency last year for alleged violation of theClear Air Act, is widely viewed as a pariah by the environmentalistmovement. It is accused of running one of the dirtiest operations togenerate power.AEP frequently has paid for advice from environmental advocate Kathleen A.McGinty, who has an unusual resume indeed. As senior legislative assistantfor energy and environmental policy to then-Sen. Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee, she quickly gained a reputation on Capitol Hill as a passionateadvocate for global climate control.Gore picked her for Clinton administration posts, enabling her to affectnational policy in a major way. In 19993, she was named to head the new WhiteHouse Office on Environmental Policy. In 19996, she was promoted to head theCouncil on Environmental Quality and became a leader in trying to sell toAmerica the massively unpopular 19997 Gore-promoted Kyoto Treaty (neverconsidered by the Senate) to slash energy consumption.Last year, McGinty emerged as a consultant with the law and lobbying firm ofTroutman Sanders. There, she has been engaged in an interesting balancingact. On the one hand, she advised AEP and the Atlanta-based Southern Co.,another power giant. On the other, she moonlighted for Gore in drafting theJune 27 energy plan. Since July, she has been working full time for theDemocratic National Committee.Gore's plan promises to \"clean up the nation's aging power plants by usingmarket-based enforcement and comprehensive standards to reduce pollution andincrease efficiency.\" It offers \"a menu of financial mechanisms\" to \"thosepower plants and industries that come forward with projects that promise todramatically reduce climate and health-threatening pollution.\"That means a big subsidy for electric power companies to help them clean uptheir plants. According to congressional energy sources, AEP would receivemillions of dollars to get right environmentally.Gore always has shown ability to reward individual corporate friends whilecastigating big business as predators. I previously reported that he hadsupported permission for deep oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico,desired only by Occidental Petroleum Corp., the source of much of hisfamily's wealth.But federal help for Occidental and American Power and the potential forconflicts of interest fly beneath the radar in a capital where the hands ofneither political party are clean. It is possible for Gore's diluted brandof populism to flourish because it is the way Washington works.\n"

Lay, the chairman, recently sent top executives a memo on his stationery asking them to contribute$1,000 each to the Bush campaign, said Steven J. Kean, an executive vice president. This year, Enron and itsemployees have contributed more than $615,000 to the Bush campaign, he said. But there are limits, even at companies like Enron. '''We might tell employees to go out and vote, but nobody tellsthem who to vote for or passes out brochures,''' Mr. Kean said.

Sadia, you will want to reflect this in what you are doing for Kyran/EEES, and Kathryn, you will want to note this, if Investor Relations is updating this data for analysts.   Margaret, FYI to you, too.Second, I note that this decision was reached after being supported by a studyby the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), saying liberalisation would bring down prices by 12-15%.   Paul H., suggest you have Viviana get a copy, and if in English, send copies to Margaret Carson.Belgian cabinet has approved draft regulation lowering power threshold to 20GWh p.a.   This goes to 10 GWh on 31 December 20002.   Sadia, I think this is again an acceleration, to be reflected in your updated numbers.   Margaret and Kathryn, also note.Finally, Kyran, I see that EnergieNed has issued a study saying that there is \"not a direct relationship between efficiency and deregulation\".   I may take issue with this, depending upon what the full text says.   Can you work with Teun/Sadia to obtain a copy, and, if not too lengthy, get it translated for my review (and presumably your's, too)?   thanksPlease do not hesitate to contact me should any of you have any questions.   thanks   mcs   \n"

On this last point, I suggested that the legislation should apply to the transmission system operator, whoever that is (i.e. it could be an investor owned utility, a publicly-owned utility, an ISO or an RTO).   I also pointed out that FERC could make this happen by itself, except in the case of public utilities like BPA.   Extending FERC jurisdiction to these entities could be among the main benefits of the legislation.Alan, please pull together the recommendations on each of these issues and forward to Linda.

Robert Pearson (our in-house film expert) has a masters in video programming, taping, etc. And the good news...within the next few weeks, the editing equipment will be fully up and running.Once installed and operational, all in-house produced videos will have the look and feel of those created by outside vendors.Please feel free to contact Beth (ext. 3.50222) if you have an interest in exploring this concept.And thank you again for your participation.Best-Kim \n"

He has an eclectic background: he spent considerable time as a stand-up comedian, then did a tour as the speechwriter for Tennessee senator Fred Thompson.   He recently had a terrific piece in the Weekly Standard taking the air out of Herblock, the Washington Post editorial cartoonist.(His bio is on our website: http:///www.whwg.com/Firm/WritersBio.cfm?StaffId=19. )   Mike has excellent instincts for and knowledge of free market ideas, and has expressed them quite effectively for a number of our clients, including high-profile CEOs and a couple of presidential candidates.   I believe he could very quickly get up to speed on your issues and produce the kind of humorous stuff you have in mind.   I would work closely with him to make sure we were getting the issues right.I propose that we begin the effort by letting Michael \"loose\" on the material.   He could get familiar with the ongoing issues in California and elsewhere, then come up with some preliminary material, including a few suggestions of how we should format it for a websiteIf you think he has the hang of it, we could have a longer discussion about how to create a permanent website and let Michael regularly write and update the material.   December is typically a slow month for us and it would be a good time to give this a try.   Let me know what you think.   I?d be happy to set up a call with the three of us.I enjoyed finally meeting you face to face at Enron and hope we can continue to work together.Best,Daniel--- Daniel CasseWhite House Writers Group615-297-5999615-297-5908 (fax)\n"
