This Friday at 6:30 p.m. Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at Jones Hall.   All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.000 a piece.   My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.   Bear in mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one of you.   While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one evening.   Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such an outing.   \"And in the end it's not the years in your life that count.   It's the life in your years.\"   - - Abraham Lincoln\n"

      "body": "\nLorraine:   here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my comments.   Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a draft to send around to the usual suspects.   1.   Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs of the acquired capacity.   -   I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to other shippers.   - Net costs will be separately recorded.2.   Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to other pipeline services?   (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain the \"no tying\" part).3.   Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?   - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or advantage to any affiliated entity.4.   Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?   - No.   PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM shippers should be minimal.   - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly preferential treatment of TW.5.   How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing open access operations?   - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with TW's mainline.   Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's tariff.   - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS (right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on TW's system.   - Lorraine --- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM --- Would we be able to acquire on an as-needed basis?   Would it be an ordinary service agreement as provided in their tariff?   Which would come first, our deal with PNM or with our shipper?   It might be good to come up with some examples of likely scenarios.6.   Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new facilities?   - Yes.   Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan Lateral.   Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.   Using the PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives available to TW to expand this portion of its system.   It would enable TW to transport an additional ___ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding the San Juan lateral.   The acquired capacity would benefit customers by effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.   Would enable both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.\n"

It is important that we work something out with Phillips today.By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language (i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in exchange for us making this compromise.   She feels that it would be inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give Phillips what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate).---"

Hope everyone had a relaxing weekend and is having a good Monday (isn't that an oxymoron?).Susan\"When I read about the evils of drinking, I gave up reading.\"   - Henny Youngman \n"

Let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 2000,000 on an interruptible basis.Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.2/18/93 letter amendment:Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 2000,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140).   Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.9/25/95 letter amendment:Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San Juan expansion is effective.My initial conclusions:   It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure requirements.   Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.   In that case we can argue impossibility of performance.   Also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure.   This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years.   The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now).   Burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive system modifications.   That argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.\n"

Lindberg, Christine Stokes/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, TK Lohman/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Michelle Lokay/ET&amp;S/Enron@Enron Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLCTW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting between the parties.   The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward.Caithness CorporationCaithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests.   The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors.   Their energy segment currently owns 1,2000 MW of generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointly-owned by Florida Power &amp; Light.Big Sandy ProjectThe Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, Arizona.   The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 5550 MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of Transwestern's pipeline.   The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near valve station #10008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station #1.   The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.   There is a 5000 KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.   This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.   I've included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.   Also, on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.   Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.   They have currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 5000 cfm.   The power plant will require approximately 3,5000 cfm of water.   In addition to the wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River.   The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash.   The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.   The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited agricultural and ranching interests.   Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of 2000.Project ScheduleGas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens   May 2000Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)   August 2000Arrange financing   December 2000EIS approval   March 20001Construction begins   April 20001Testing begins   July 20002Commercial Operation   November 20002There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).   There is only one endangered/threatened species known to be present in the area.Lateral Pipeline AlignmentThe most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.   The alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed next month.   Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline.   The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available.   Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.   Typically, pipelines require a 1000 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent right of way.   Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section line.   The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring.   The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.   The only issue there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.Other Preliminary Project IssuesThere are other fundamental issues to address.   The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.   Transwestern's original estimate to construct a 16\" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was based on the following specifications:120 MMcf/d450 psig delivery pressure,9000 psig inlet pressureThe meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher 5550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse turbines).   In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at a pressure 1000-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.   In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the design will likely change to a 20\" pipeline.Next Steps (responsible party/department) Task   Date Due Party/Dept.

The very good news, though, is that   TW's proposal was included in both settlements (now that's hedging!).   Thus,   the benefits to TW were preserved under both proposals.   Congratulations.   That's fantastic---hard work that paid off.We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.   We should discuss.   Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.

The purpose of my changes was to (i) apportion the risk assumed by TW and Calpine based on the economic benefits realized by the parties and the ability of a party to insure against the risk, and (ii) to clearly identify the parts of the facilities to be serviced by TW and the list of services routinely performed.   I noticed that there is no insurance   coverage   required of either Party.   I expect that Calpine insures its property against casualties and is therefore in the best position to assume the risk of loss or damage to its property.   On the other-hand, third party property that is in the care, custody and control of TW while it performs its work, is not covered by Enron's standard general liability policies.   Builder's risk   coverage must be purchased to cover this risk; the coverage is expensive.   Section 5.4 and Section 4.1 reflect this reasoning. If TW plans to limit its financial responsibility to the amount of money collected by Customer from TW's insurance carriers, then an Insurance section should be included, and the penultimate sentence of Section 5.4 further edited to stipulate that limitation.   If TW's limitation of liability is to be a percentage of the total amount of revenues and compensation it receives under this transaction, then that dollar-amount should be inserted in the latter mentioned sentence of Section 5.4.Please contact me if you have any questions about my changes.\n"

Cinderella was stunned.Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edgeofthe porch, quivering with fear. Cinderella said \"Oh thank you, FairyGodmother\".The Fairy Godmother replied, \"It is the least I can do. What does yourheartwant for your second wish?\" Cinderella looked down at her frail body,andsaid: \"I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again.\"At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautifulyouthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her thathadbeen dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began tocourse through her.Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke \"You have one more wish, what shallyouhave?\" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner andsays\";\"I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, andhandsomeyoung man\".Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in hisbiologicalmake-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful thelike of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birdsbegan to fall from the sky at his feet.The Fairy Godmother again spoke: \"Congratulations, Cinderella.Enjoy your new life.\" And, with a blazing shock of bright blueelectricity,she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked intoeachother's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunninglyperfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, whosattransfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his youngmusculararms.He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as hewhispered:\"I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?\"\n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nAs you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.   In the context of the Gallup Expansion, Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to Topock.   Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point:   40 MMcf/d more than PG&amp;E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be present.Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers would be if PG&amp;E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at PG&amp;E/Topock.   The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper.   More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper.   In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered.   In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide service under an FTS-1 contract.   A shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action.   Not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points.Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.   I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages.   Can we meet briefly to discuss this?   I'm available after the Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a meeting time for next week.   Thank you.\n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nJeff --- since most of Teddy's comments were over my head yesterday, I could use your help on that part of the discussion.***Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.   After a brief overview of the proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.   Here is a summary of the comments.Marketing affiliate concerns.   BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.   For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA buys a call option it is essentially a free option.   ENA could buy a call out of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to Enron's bottom line.   BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit the call money to other shippers.   BP's concern is that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.   Dynegy reiterated its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a certain percentage.   Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of capacity to marketing affiliates.   At this point we are not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.   If BP and others have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all interstate pipelines.Right of first refusal.   Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.   Our response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.Negotiated rate.   BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.   We did not respond to this or discuss it further.   However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum rate.   Hoarding capacity.   Several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.   It was not clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for hoarding than already exists.   Their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.   We acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.   Although we did not commit to placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.Our plan is to meet with PG&amp;E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.\n"

      "body": "\nLorraine, I've been studying the El Paso/Dynegy reservation reduction mechanism (RRM).   Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical threshold.   (The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)   The volumes in excess of the threshold were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its minimum pay obligation for a particular month.This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed it.   FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT, it was not unduly discriminatory.   The \"unduly discriminatory\" conclusion was based on an analysis on the potential effect on the Cal. gas transportation market --- the Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Dynegy nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much firm capacity was available.I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.   We would have to file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get FERC to accept it.   That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 to chat with you more about the Duke (I have a conference call with MKM from 1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47).\n"

The answer is no.\r With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=\rral Power Act (\"FPA\") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=\r governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=\r commerce, \"shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=\rtate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =\rinstrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=\rch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=\roing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=\rh in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =\rreference thereto.\"\r Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=\rve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =\rstate agencies and municipalities.\r With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=\r exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=\rrovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=\rs making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=\r rate schedules with FERC.   QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=\rthorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=\rst.   FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=\rket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =\rbut that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=\r a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=\r status is lost.\r Let me know if you need anything else.\r   Andrea M.

John D. Rockefeller, formerCEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energymanagement division.   Said Rockefeller, \"Obviously Hell has significantheating demands.   While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, theyrequire vast and reliable fuel resources.   Enron was the only supplierwilling to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I justlike the way they do business.\"A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easilytogether during negotiations.   According to the company, \"The deal fits bothcompanies exceptionally well.   With Hades' ability to attract and retain newcustomers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia tocome.\"   According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heatingdemand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a veryattractive energy portfolio addition.Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide andapproximately 173 quintillion customers.   The entity boasts sustained highgrowth rates over the last two thousand years.Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communicationsassets.   Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's \"Best 1000 Companies toWork For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours AWeek,\" and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked bycustomers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supplycontracts.\n"

The conversation was quite slow going so I&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;talk more privately. So we went to this restaurant and he's&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;STILL acting a bit funny and I'm trying to cheer him up and&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;start to wonder whether it's me or something else.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;I ask him, and he says no. But you know I'm not really sure.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;So anyway, in the cab back to his house, I say that I love him&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;and he just puts his arm around me. I don't know what the hell&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;this means because you know he doesn't say it back or anything.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;We finally get back to his place and I'm wondering if he's&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;going to dump me!&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   So I try to ask him about it but he just switches on the TV.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   Reluctantly, I say I'm going to go to sleep. Then, after about&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   10 minutes, he joins me and we have sex. But, he still seemed&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to leave.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   I dunno, I just don't know, what he thinks anymore.

The conversation was quite slow going so I&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;thought we should go off somewhere more intimate so we could&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;talk more privately. So we went to this restaurant and he's&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;STILL acting a bit funny and I'm trying to cheer him up and&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;start to wonder whether it's me or something else.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;I ask him, and he says no. But you know I'm not really sure.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;So anyway, in the cab back to his house, I say that I love him&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;and he just puts his arm around me. I don't know what the hell&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;this means because you know he doesn't say it back or anything.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;We finally get back to his place and I'm wondering if he's&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;going to dump me!&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   So I try to ask him about it but he just switches on the TV.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   Reluctantly, I say I'm going to go to sleep. Then, after about&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   10 minutes, he joins me and we have sex. But, he still seemed&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   really distracted, so afterwards I just wanted to leave.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   I dunno, I just don't know, what he thinks anymore. I mean,&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   do you think he's met someone else?&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;HIS STORY:&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;Lousy day at work.

Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing comments.   Please forward any additional comments no later than noon, Friday March 10.Significant changes from the last draft are as follows:1.   We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost &amp; revenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess revenues. (p.2)2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to existing settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our rights. (p.4)3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.   We are asking the Commission to immediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate agreements. (p.5-6)4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted --- masking shipper names, clarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying the Sept. 1 reporting date.   With respect to these last two arguments, we have decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price caps on capacity release is to be implemented.\n"

The most important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of the result to the community.\" --- Albert Einstein \"Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh.\" ---W.H. Auden\"Learn to give yourself what you wish you could get from somebody else.\" --- Steven Ouellette\"The game of life is a game of boomerangs.

      "body": "\nLast month Lindy and I began looking into adding a provision to TW's tariff allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from TW.   There is good precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from TW mandatory (see the attached memo).   Mary Kay, as you and I discussed, we will need to address the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this. \n"

You wore that rainbow shirt that was half-sleeves and the&lt; &lt; rainbow went&lt; &lt; up&lt; &lt;   &lt;one sleeve, across your chest and down the other.&lt; &lt;   &lt;2. You made baby chocolate cakes in your Holly Hobbie Easy Bake&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Oven. You&lt; &lt;   &lt;washed them down with The Snoopy Snow Cone Machine.&lt; &lt;   &lt;3.   You had that Fisher Price Doctor's kit with a stethoscope&lt; &lt; that&lt; &lt; actually&lt; &lt;   &lt;worked.   After training with these tools you became an expert&lt; &lt; at&lt; &lt; the game&lt; &lt; of&lt; &lt;   &lt;\"operation\".&lt; &lt;   &lt;4. Legos, Legos, Legos&lt; &lt;   &lt;5.   You owned a schwin bicycle with a floral banana seat and a&lt; &lt; basket. In&lt; &lt;   &lt;the early 80's you moved onto the ever popular 10 speed.   Gosh&lt; &lt; that&lt; &lt; seat&lt; &lt;   &lt;hurt.&lt; &lt;   &lt;6.   Your rollerskates had metal wheels.&lt; &lt;   &lt;7.   Admit it...you thought Gopher from Love Boat was cute.&lt; &lt; You&lt; &lt; had&lt; &lt;   &lt;nightmares after watching Fantasy Island.&lt; &lt;   &lt;8.   You had rubber boots for rainy days.   Your shoes actually&lt; &lt; fit&lt; &lt; inside of&lt; &lt;   &lt;the boots (with a little help from your mom and some plastic&lt; &lt; bags).&lt; &lt;   &lt;9.   You had Sea Wees in your bath tub.&lt; &lt;   &lt;10.   You had either a \"bowl cut\" or a \"pixie\" (not to mention&lt; &lt; the&lt; &lt; \"Dorothy&lt; &lt;   &lt;Hamill\") because your mom was sick of braiding your hair.   How&lt; &lt; traumatic&lt; &lt;   &lt;when people thought you were a boy.&lt; &lt;   &lt;111.   Your sleeping bag was your most prized   possession.&lt; &lt;   &lt;12.   You wore a \"poncho\" with your faux fur \"muff\" and your&lt; &lt; clogs.&lt; &lt;   &lt;13.   You begged Santa for the electronic game...Simon.&lt; &lt;   &lt;14.   You had the Donnie and Marie dolls with those pink and&lt; &lt; purple&lt; &lt; shredded&lt; &lt;   &lt;outfits.&lt; &lt;   &lt;15.   You spent hours out back on your metal swing set with the&lt; &lt; trapeze.&lt; &lt;   &lt;16.   You were into ping pong.&lt; &lt;   &lt;17.   You had homemade ribbon barrettes in every imaginable&lt; &lt; color.&lt; &lt;   &lt;18.   You kept losing your mittens so your mom bought you the&lt; &lt; kind&lt; &lt; that were&lt; &lt;   &lt;attached by a string.&lt; &lt;   &lt;19.   Your Hello Kitty pencil case was cuter than anyone else's.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;20.   You wanted to be Laura Ingalls Wilder really bad. You wore&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; that Little&lt; &lt;   &lt;House on the Prairie-inspired plaid, ruffled shirt with the&lt; &lt; high&lt; &lt; neck in at&lt; &lt;   &lt;least one school picture. You despised Nelle Olson!&lt; &lt;   &lt;21.   You wanted your first kiss to be at the roller rink.&lt; &lt;   &lt;222. You tried to make sure that no boys would grab the comb out&lt; &lt; of&lt; &lt; your&lt; &lt; back&lt; &lt;   &lt;pocket and skate away at the roller rink.&lt; &lt;   &lt;23.Your hairstyle was ever described as having \"wings\".&lt; &lt;   &lt;24.You thought Shaun Cassidy actually wrote the songs \"Da Do&lt; &lt; Run&lt; &lt; Run\" and&lt; &lt;   &lt;\"Hey There Lonely Girl\".&lt; &lt;   &lt;25. Strawberry Shortcake and her friends Blueberry Muffin and&lt; &lt; Huckleberry&lt; &lt;   &lt;Pie.&lt; &lt;   &lt;26.

You carried a lunch box to school.&lt; &lt;   &lt;28. You and your girlfriends would fight over which of the&lt; &lt; Dukes of&lt; &lt; Hazard&lt; &lt;   &lt;was your boyfriend or who would get to be Ginger and who got&lt; &lt; stuck&lt; &lt; being&lt; &lt;   &lt;Mary Anne.&lt; &lt;   &lt;29. You memorized every song on the \"Annie\" movie and know at&lt; &lt; least&lt; &lt; one&lt; &lt;   &lt;person who immediately went out and got the Annie do.&lt; &lt;   &lt;30. You had Star Wars action figures, too.&lt; &lt;   &lt;31. You thought unicorns were real.&lt; &lt;   &lt;32. It was a big event in your household each year when the&lt; &lt; \"Wizard&lt; &lt; of Oz\"&lt; &lt;   &lt;would come on TV. Break out the popcorn and sleeping bags!&lt; &lt;   &lt;333.   You wanted to be a part of the Von Trappe family.&lt; &lt;   &lt;34. Light as a feather, stiff as a board.&lt; &lt;   &lt;35. You loved The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe so much you&lt; &lt; got&lt; &lt; the&lt; &lt;   &lt;whole Chronicles of Narnia series for Christmas but never read&lt; &lt; the&lt; &lt; other&lt; &lt;   &lt;books.&lt; &lt;   &lt;36. You crawled in a wardrobe somewhere and actually believed&lt; &lt; for a&lt; &lt; few&lt; &lt;   &lt;seconds that you were on your way to Narnia.&lt; &lt;   &lt;37. You completely wore-out your Grease, Saturday Night&lt; &lt; Fever,Footloose and&lt; &lt;   &lt;Flashdance soundtrack albums.&lt; &lt;   &lt;38. You tried to do lots of arts and crafts things, like yarn &amp;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; popsicle&lt; &lt;   &lt;stick God's Eyes or those weird potholders made on a plastic&lt; &lt; loom.&lt; &lt;   &lt;39. Shrinky-dinks!   What was so appealing about these?!&lt; &lt;   &lt;40. You used to tape record songs off the radio by holding your&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; portable&lt; &lt;   &lt;tape recorder up to the speaker.&lt; &lt;   &lt;41.   You couldn't wait to get the free animal poster that came&lt; &lt; when&lt; &lt; you&lt; &lt;   &lt;ordered   books from the Scholastic book orders your teacher&lt; &lt; would&lt; &lt; give you.&lt; &lt;   &lt;Remember?&lt; &lt;   &lt;The order catalogs looked like miniature newspapers.&lt; &lt;   &lt;42.   You learned everything you needed to know about girl&lt; &lt; issues&lt; &lt; from Judy&lt; &lt;   &lt;Blume books. Are you there God? It's me, Margaret.&lt; &lt;   &lt;43. Care Bears.&lt; &lt;   &lt;444. You thought Olivia Newton John's song \"Physical\" was about&lt; &lt; aerobics.&lt; &lt;   &lt;45.   \"Wiggles\" jeans with the embroidery on the back pockets.&lt; &lt;   &lt;46.

Every takeoff is optional. Every landing is mandatory.&lt; &lt; 2. If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger. If you pull the&lt; &lt; stick back, they get smaller. That is, unless you keep pulling the stick&lt; all&lt; &lt; the way back, then they get bigger again.&lt; &lt; 3. Flying isn't dangerous. Crashing is what's dangerous.&lt; &lt; 4. It's always better to be down here wishing you were up there than up&lt; &lt; there&lt; &lt; wishing you were down here.&lt; &lt; 5. The ONLY time you have too much fuel is when you're on fire.&lt; &lt; 6. The propeller is just a big fan in front of the plane used to keepthe&lt; &lt; pilot cool. When it stops, you can actually watch the pilot start&lt; sweating.&lt; &lt; 7. When in doubt, hold on to your altitude. No one has ever collidedwith&lt; &lt; the&lt; &lt; sky.&lt; &lt; 8. A 'good' landing is one from which you can walk away. A 'great'landing&lt; &lt; is&lt; &lt; one after which they can use the plane again.&lt; &lt; 9. Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long enough to make&lt; all&lt; &lt; of them yourself.&lt; &lt; 10. You know you've landed with the wheels up if it takes full power to&lt; taxi&lt; &lt; to the ramp.&lt; &lt; 111. The probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angleof&lt; &lt; arrival. Large angle of arrival, small probability of survival and vice&lt; &lt; versa.&lt; &lt; 12. Never let an aircraft take you somewhere your brain didn't get tofive&lt; &lt; minutes earlier.&lt; &lt; 13. Stay out of clouds. The silver lining everyone keeps talking about&lt; might&lt; &lt; be another airplane going in the opposite direction. Reliable sourcesalso&lt; &lt; report that mountains have been known to hide out in clouds.&lt; &lt; 14. Always try to keep the number of landings you make equal to thenumber&lt; &lt; of&lt; &lt; take-offs you've made.&lt; &lt; 15. There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing.&lt; Unfortunately&lt; &lt; no one knows what they are.&lt; &lt; 16. You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience.The&lt; &lt; trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of luck.&lt; &lt; 17. Helicopters can't fly; they're just so ugly the earth repels them.&lt; &lt; 18. If all you can see out of the window is ground that's going roundand&lt; &lt; round and all you can hear is commotion coming from the passenger&lt; &lt; compartment, things are not at all as they should be.&lt; &lt; 19. In the ongoing battle between objects made of aluminum goinghundreds&lt; of&lt; &lt; miles per hour and the ground going zero miles per hour, the ground has&lt; yet&lt; &lt; to lose.&lt; &lt; 20. Good judgment comes from experience. Unfortunately, the experience&lt; &lt; usually comes from bad judgment.&lt; &lt; 21. It's always a good idea to keep the pointy end going forward as much&lt; as&lt; &lt; possible.&lt; &lt; 222. Keep looking around. There's always something you've missed.&lt; &lt; 23. Remember, gravity is not just a good idea. It's the law. And it'snot&lt; &lt; subject to repeal.&lt; &lt; 24. The three most useless things to a pilot are the altitude above you,&lt; &lt; runway behind you, and a tenth of a second ago&lt; &lt; ---&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Here are some actual maintenance complaints submitted by US Air Force&lt; pilots&lt; &lt; and the replies from the maintenance crews. \"Squawks\" are problemlistings&lt; &lt; that pilots generally leave for maintenance crews to fix before the next&lt; &lt; flight.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P)=PROBLEM (S)=SOLUTION&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Left inside main tire almost needs replacement&lt; &lt; (S) Almost replaced left inside main tire&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Test flight OK, except autoland very rough,&lt; &lt; (S) Autoland not installed on this aircraft&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) #2 Propeller seeping prop fluid,&lt; &lt; (S) #2 Propeller seepage normal - #1 #3 and #4propellers   lack normal&lt; &lt; seepage&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Something loose in cockpit&lt; &lt; (S) Something tightened in cockpit&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Evidence of leak on right main landing gear&lt; &lt; (S) Evidence removed&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) DME volume unbelievably loud&lt; &lt; (S) Volume set to more believable level&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Dead bugs on windshield&lt; &lt; (S) Live bugs on order&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Autopilot in altitude hold mode produces a2000 fpm descent&lt; &lt; (S) Cannot reproduce problem on ground&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) IFF inoperative&lt; &lt; (S) IFF always inoperative in OFF mode&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Friction locks cause throttle levers to stick&lt; &lt; (S) That's what they're there for&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Number three engine missing&lt; &lt; (S) Engine found on right wing after brief search&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Aircraft handles funny&lt; &lt; (S) Aircraft warned to straighten up, \"flyright\" and be serious&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; (P) Target Radar hums&lt; &lt; (S) Reprogrammed Target Radar with the words&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

You have to give the guy some propsfor&lt; &lt; being self-deprecating...but I hope I never meet him on game day.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; ***&lt; &lt; A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the earlymorninghours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:6:000 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)8:53 Crack open second beer8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smooth 9510:35 Headed for San Antonio10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities111:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquorstore and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle \"Traveler\" Jim Beam111:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in thesky. About 70 degrees.111:555 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.111:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the secondfloor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to thestreet right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes ofTexas. AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-1000 grown men are bumping chestswith one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of thefact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.1:000 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hootand holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right belowus to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the\"Traveler\" and 111 cans of beer into my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I amtaunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out ofNebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\"Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraskajackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the FiestaBowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: \"And not those damn refundabletickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!\" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlinesand buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 111 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour myfirst stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy from the Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of theend zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.4:111 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, Iattempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:\"Hey, buddy, niice cock.\" He is unamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share mybeer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they areequipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, sothat we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.   Nebraska is a bunchof pussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 222, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. Thisnormally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have beenconfirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.\"5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by thispolicy. I ask loudly: \"Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over thefucking PA system???!!!\"5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter, awaking from mycoma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\" Alas, the answer is no, we were notwinning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day fromtheTexas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunneland Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters \"S\", \"K\",and \"A\" in the \"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end zone.   I cheer wildly.I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I wouldtaunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am toodrunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of theevening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them inOctober, they would be playing Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:000 Texas-Arizonatip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.   *It is warm.I don't care.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walkpast the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it'sany good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink theZima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredientsare, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I leanover the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximatelytwopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singingBrooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other goodsongs besides \"You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" andthat maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.I tell him to fuck off and restart \"Neon Moon.\"8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud andprofane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.Itell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we mayas well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissedabout the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon Moon\" loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going tokick the shit out of Arizona.9:111 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to thebathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of thenew opportunity to do \"the bathroom Brice.\" There are no Arizona fans in thebathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a\"Niice cock.\" No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.   Needlessto say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light outofa can. I am stopped by an usher: \"Where did you get that, sir?\" I tell him(no shit): \"Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those littleplastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?\" I take thelast swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to thebathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance toavoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group ofpeople and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like alittle girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. Ihave no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared outthe seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps Ishouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive \"worst fucking call I have EVER seen,\" Iattempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.   However,on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and all over my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to myself, \"I'm taking this abit seriously.\"10:222 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying andgrunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants arebloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I looklike I should be in an episode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and makemy way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but Imerely grunt incoherently and keep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up sixflights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in theface for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, andcollapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I take a nap.111:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined upall the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.   Iam too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bedof the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the secondfloor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at melike I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on thefront of his truck while singing the lyrics to \"Neon Moon.\"12:111 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go fromvehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to myapartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle ofGlenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to dietonight.12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decideit would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.   Wegiggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enterhis club. \"Fellas,\" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, \"I've been working this door for almost a year.

Sorry, can't let you in.\" Weattempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.1:444 We find a bar that lets us in.

Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...thealab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today...\" We order 6 shots of tequilaand three beers.2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two andone half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tellhim to keep it.2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seatedimmediately.2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, twoorders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheesestuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. Thewaiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of therestaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck.

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in thesky. About 70 degrees.111:555 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.111:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the secondfloor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to thestreet right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes ofTexas. AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-1000 grown men are bumping chestswith one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of thefact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.1:000 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hootand holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right belowus to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the\"Traveler\" and 111 cans of beer into my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I amtaunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out ofNebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\"Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraskajackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the FiestaBowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: \"And not those damn refundabletickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!\" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlinesand buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 111 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour myfirst stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy from the Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of theend zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.4:111 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, Iattempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:\"Hey, buddy, niice cock.\" He is unamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share mybeer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they areequipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, sothat we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.   Nebraska is a bunchof pussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 222, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. Thisnormally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have beenconfirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.\"5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by thispolicy. I ask loudly: \"Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over thefucking PA system???!!!\"5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter, awaking from mycoma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\" Alas, the answer is no, we were notwinning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day fromtheTexas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunneland Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters \"S\", \"K\",and \"A\" in the \"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end zone.   I cheer wildly.I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I wouldtaunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am toodrunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of theevening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them inOctober, they would be playing Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:000 Texas-Arizonatip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.   *It is warm.I don't care.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walkpast the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it'sany good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink theZima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredientsare, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I leanover the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximatelytwopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singingBrooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other goodsongs besides \"You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" andthat maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.I tell him to fuck off and restart \"Neon Moon.\"8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud andprofane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.Itell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we mayas well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissedabout the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon Moon\" loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going tokick the shit out of Arizona.9:111 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to thebathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of thenew opportunity to do \"the bathroom Brice.\" There are no Arizona fans in thebathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a\"Niice cock.\" No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.   Needlessto say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light outofa can. I am stopped by an usher: \"Where did you get that, sir?\" I tell him(no shit): \"Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those littleplastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?\" I take thelast swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to thebathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance toavoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group ofpeople and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like alittle girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. Ihave no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared outthe seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps Ishouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive \"worst fucking call I have EVER seen,\" Iattempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.   However,on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and all over my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to myself, \"I'm taking this abit seriously.\"10:222 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying andgrunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants arebloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I looklike I should be in an episode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and makemy way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but Imerely grunt incoherently and keep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up sixflights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in theface for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, andcollapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I take a nap.111:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined upall the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.   Iam too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bedof the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the secondfloor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at melike I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on thefront of his truck while singing the lyrics to \"Neon Moon.\"12:111 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go fromvehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to myapartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle ofGlenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to dietonight.12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decideit would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.   Wegiggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enterhis club. \"Fellas,\" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, \"I've been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in thistown for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seenthree drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in.\" Weattempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.1:444 We find a bar that lets us in.

We hail a cab to take us the two andone half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tellhim to keep it.2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seatedimmediately.2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, twoorders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheesestuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.2:39 The food arrives.

I tell him we mayas well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissedabout the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon Moon\" loudly.8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going tokick the shit out of Arizona.9:111 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to thebathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of thenew opportunity to do \"the bathroom Brice.\" There are no Arizona fans in thebathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a\"Niice cock.\" No one is amused but me.9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.   Needlessto say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light outofa can. I am stopped by an usher: \"Where did you get that, sir?\" I tell him(no shit): \"Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those littleplastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?\" I take thelast swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to thebathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance toavoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group ofpeople and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like alittle girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. Ihave no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared outthe seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating thesurrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps Ishouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.10:15 After the fourth consecutive \"worst fucking call I have EVER seen,\" Iattempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.   However,on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my lefteye and all over my shirt. \"Perhaps,\" I think to myself, \"I'm taking this abit seriously.\"10:222 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying andgrunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants arebloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I looklike I should be in an episode of Cops.10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and makemy way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a goodsamaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but Imerely grunt incoherently and keep moving.10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up sixflights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in theface for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, andcollapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I take a nap.111:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift myhead to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined upall the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.   Iam too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and noone is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice thattraffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, andno one is moving. I call my friend a \"Stupid cocksucker.\"111:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bedof the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the secondfloor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at melike I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on thefront of his truck while singing the lyrics to \"Neon Moon.\"12:111 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go fromvehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return tomy vehicle.12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to myapartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle ofGlenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to dietonight.12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decideit would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.   Wegiggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enterhis club. \"Fellas,\" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, \"I've been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in thistown for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seenthree drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in.\" Weattempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.1:444 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear\"Last call for alcohol!\" I turn to the group and mutter: \"See, dat wasn'tthat fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...thealab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today...\" We order 6 shots of tequilaand three beers.2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two andone half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tellhim to keep it.2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seatedimmediately.2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, twoorders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheesestuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. Thewaiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of therestaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is$1112 with tip.2:46 I'm sleepy.9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.She is not pretty.&lt; &lt;&lt; - att1.htm\n"

Awesome day. Not a single cloud in thesky. About 70 degrees.111:555 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.111:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the secondfloor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to thestreet right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes ofTexas. AWESOME MOMENT.12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-1000 grown men are bumping chestswith one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of thefact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.1:000 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hootand holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right belowus to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convincedthat we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the\"Traveler\" and 111 cans of beer into my pants.1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I amtaunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out ofNebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as \"Cell-Phone Flop Out.\"Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraskajackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should \"flop out\" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the FiestaBowl. And then I spoke these memorable words: \"And not those damn refundabletickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrablesons-of-bitches!\" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlinesand buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 111 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom.2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour myfirst stiffy.2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy from the Traveler.3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing inline, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of theend zone. Safety.3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.4:111 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, Iattempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:\"Hey, buddy, niice cock.\" He is unamused.4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share mybeer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they areequipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, sothat we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.   Nebraska is a bunchof pussies.4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.5:18 Score is Nebraska 222, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. Thisnormally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: \"I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have beenconfirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.\"5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold whenthere is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by thispolicy. I ask loudly: \"Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over thefucking PA system???!!!\"5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. \"Whazzis?,\" I mutter, awaking from mycoma, \"Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?\" Alas, the answer is no, we were notwinning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day fromtheTexas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunneland Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters \"S\", \"K\",and \"A\" in the \"Nebraska\" spelled out in their end zone.   I cheer wildly.I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I wouldtaunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am toodrunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of theevening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them inOctober, they would be playing Florida State for the nationalchampionship.6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:000 Texas-Arizonatip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.   *It is warm.I don't care.7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walkpast the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it'sany good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink theZima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredientsare, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I leanover the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximatelytwopounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singingBrooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of mysinging. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other goodsongs besides \"You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone\" and \"Neon Moon\" andthat maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bitexcessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.I tell him to fuck off and restart \"Neon Moon.\"8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud andprofane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.Itell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we mayas well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissedabout the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle \"Neon Moon\" loudly.8:47 I am rallying.

I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself.I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poorblack child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee.   I was born ina log cabin that I built with my own hands.   I taught myself to read bycandlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by workingsummers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River steamboat.My mother taught me the value of education, so every day I would walk 5miles to a one-room schoolhouse.   I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp,thought I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serveas the inspiration for \"Huckleberry Finn.\"Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens.One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him ifanyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for allAmericans.   Well, I guess I made an impression.   You see, the minister'sname was Martin Luther King, Jr.My father was a United States Senator.   He once perched me on his kneeand said, \"Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday youcan live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prepschool.\"But life of privilege was not for me.   After getting my high schooldiploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.   I was so appalledat the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, myclose friends at the AFL-CIO call me \"Norma Rae.\"When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvardcalled and offered me a scholarship.   I captained the hockey team tofour consecutive national championships, but I also played football andwas good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.   During my college years, Ilived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for alittle rock band.   You may have heard of it --- the Rolling Stones.But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country.   SoI enlisted in the U.   S.   Army and went to Vietnam.   I was deeplyopposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back homewith the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man,I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelterson that journey all said the same thing: \"Al, we need you inWashington.\"I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some otherbusiness---building the World Trade Center, founding the AudubonSociety, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer,and coming up with the recipe for Mrs.   Field's chocolate chip cookies.Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee andallowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate,where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.   And then one winterday nearly nine years ago, for no particular reason, I answered the callof the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice Presidentof the United States.Since then, I've been part of the most successful administration inAmerican history.   And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet.Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and hasasked me what to do.   And when I would give him my thoughts, he wouldinvariable say, \"Of course.   That's brilliant.   Why didn't I think ofthat?\" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the presidenttold me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away formthat dark-haired intern.So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and askedif he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice --- words I'llnever forget.   He looked me in the eye and he said, \"Al, just tell thetruth, it's always worked for me.\"\n"

        " Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 04/06/2000 06:24 PM ---   RE:   Southern AdviceADVICE TO NORTHERNERS MOVING SOUTH:The following is a pre-approved posting whose purpose is to offer insightand advice to Northerners moving South.1.   Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to useitshortly.2.   Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southernerscan. Stay home the two days of the year it snows.3.   If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.   Four men in the cabof a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will bealong shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This iswhat they live for.4.   You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know thepositions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to findit yourself.5.   Remember: \"Y'all is singular.\"   \"All y'all is plural.\" All y'all's isplural possessive.\"6. Get used to hearing, \"You ain't from around here, are you?\"7.   Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don'tunderstand you, either.8.   The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner'svocabulary is the adjective \"big ol,\" as in \"big ol truck,\" or \"big olboy.\"9.   As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 555-mph zone, directlyin the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive ona John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for thatvehicle.10. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, \"Hey, y'all, watch this!\" Stay out ofhis way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still,that you will ever hear.111. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. Infact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate,you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car waspurchased.12. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let aloneeating.13. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait untilDecember.14. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the mostminuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the localgrocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store.It is just something you're supposed to do.15. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchaseone,itis positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing inmind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should,therefore, be prominently displayed.16.   Be advised that in the South, \"He needed killin'\" is a valid defense.=== End Part 2 ===\n"

And I really hope nobodygives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. Itwill be good if at least one time you can see puppiesborn and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get ablack eye fighting for something you believe in, Ihope you have to share a bedroom with your youngerbrother.

When you want to see a movie andyour little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'llet him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school withyour friends and that you live in a town where you cando it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch aride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you twoblocks away so you won't be seen riding with someoneas uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hopeyour Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buyingone. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and readbooks.

I don't care if you try a beer once, but Ihope you don't like it. And if a friend offers youdope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not yourfriend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porchwith your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. Mayyou feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during theholidays. I hope your mother punishes you when youthrow a baseball through you neighbor's window andthat she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas timewhen you give her a plaster mold of your hand.

&lt; &lt;   &lt; As if people did this all the time.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; But when our orders were brought out,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I did not enjoy mine.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I could not take my eyes off Mae,&lt;

  &lt; Well, the next time I went out to eat,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I called and invited Mae.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; My lunch contained white tuna meat,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; She ordered a parfait.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I smiled when her dish I viewed,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; And she asked if she amused me.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I answered, Yes, you do,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; But also you confuse me.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; How come you order rich desserts,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; When I feel I must be sensible?&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; She laughed and said, with wanton mirth,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I am tasting all that's possible.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I try to eat the food I need,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; And do the things I should.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; But life's so short, my friend, indeed,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I hate missing out on something good.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; This year I realized how old I was,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; She grinned, I've not been this old before.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; So, before I die, I've got to try,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Those things for years I had ignored.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I've not smelled all the flowers yet,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; There's too many books I have not read.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; There's more fudge sundaes to wolf down,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; And kites to be flown overhead.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; There are many malls I have not shopped,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I've not laughed at all the jokes.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I've missed a lot of Broadway Hits,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; And potato chips and cokes.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I want to wade again in water,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; And feel ocean spray upon my face.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Sit in a country church once more,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; And thank God for It's grace.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I want peanut butter every day,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Spread on my morning toast.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I want un-timed long-distance calls,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; To the folks I love the most.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I've not cried at all the movies yet,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Nor walked in the morning rain.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I need to feel wind in my hair,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I want to fall in love again.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; So, if I choose to have dessert,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Instead of having dinner.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Then should I die before night fall,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I'd say I died a winner.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Because I missed out on nothing,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I filled my heart's desire.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I had that final chocolate mousse,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Before my life expired.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; With that, I called the waitress over,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I've changed my mind, it seems.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; I said, I want what she is having,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Only add some more whipped-cream!&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Here is a little something for you all!&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; We need an annual Girlfriends Day!&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; If you get this twice,&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; then you have more than one girlfriend.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt; Be happy.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt;

&lt; &lt;   &lt;   and cheaper too!&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;   * Laughter makes the world a happier place.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;   * Friends are like wine; they get better with age.&lt; &lt; &lt;   &lt;   * Sometimes you just need a shoulder to cry on.&lt;

Folders\\'sent mail\rX-Origin: SCOTT-S\rX-FileName: sscott3.nsf\r   Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement conferences.   Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in lieu of a redlined document. Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt points on the SoCalGas system. Not only does the proposal satisfy the Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas transportation.   CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's system. Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not been fully described in the CAC document.   To this end, Transwestern proposes that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.   Transwestern looks forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.Susan ScottSenior CounselTranswestern Pipeline Company(713) 853-0596sscott3@enron.com\n"

The CPUC in its draft Order on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding in May, 1999 listed, among a variety of \"promising options,\" the institution of Mojave's \"Hector Road\" as a commercial receipt point into the SoCalGas system.   In fact, the CPUC held in its \"Findings of Fact\" with regard to Hector Road that: - It is unlikely that the market will accurately reflect the value of transmission resources if SoCalGas were to define its marketable transmission access in a way that did not include the Hector Road facilities, and - The failure to provide at least window-style access through Hector Road has resulted in lost opportunities for bringing relatively inexpensive gas into Southern California.The basis for the CPUC finding came from testimony taken during the proceeding indicating that the use of Hector Road displaces deliveries to the constrained delivery point at Wheeler Ridge.   In other words, whatever could be delivered by Mojave at Hector Road frees-up space at Wheeler Ridge, a delivery point many in the marketplace considered more desirable.As first articulated by SoCalGas in its draft settlement proposal in the summer of 1999, the Hector Road point would be established as a formal receipt point into SoCalGas, with rights equal to Transwestern's delivery point at North Needles.   With a meter capacity of 2000 MMcf/d, and with the market's apparent interest in securing additional capacity at Hector Road, Transwestern was facing the real possibility of losing up to 2000 MMcf/d of access rights into SoCalGas at North Needles.   Using an average transport rate of $0.25/Mcf, the resulting loss in transport revenues would be $19MM per year.Through months of [seemingly endless] negotiations, and through an educational process begun by Transwestern during one of the early settlement meetings back in September 1999, Transwestern went from a party with a \"bullseye\" clearly taped on its back, to a party that other stakeholders were depending on for a principled solution to these receipt point issues.   As it stands now, the Appendix A to the Settlement Agreement, \"Primary and Secondary Receipt Point Access Rights\" is nearly identical to the principles outlined by Transwestern in that September settlement meeting.I only re-state the obvious here to remind the group what their hard work has accomplished.   Not only am I proud to see that the resulting Settlement Agreement filed with the CPUC today treats Transwestern and its shippers equitably, but I'm proud that the work group we cobbled together for this effort functioned like a \"well oiled machine.\"I thank each of you for your efforts to get to this point.

To streamline things, the parties are going to consolidate efforts and have divided up the testimony by topic.   Of course Transwestern got the Hector Road issue.   I plan to put Mr. Fawcett on as a witness.

The engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not harmful to the compressor for the short term.It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.   Rolls will be reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any further feedback.TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit piping. EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction strainer.   The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage.   The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.   It is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system.EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run time.   It is expected that   any foreign material in the suction piping should have already been caught in the strainer.   Secondly, the station was designed with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor.It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while the startup strainer is removed.   Care must be taken during the reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment or apply stress to the compressor nozzles.James Pfeffer\n"

      "body": "\nHere is the quick &amp; dirty.None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not placed in service by a certain date.   The respective obligations of the parties do not commence until the facilities are \"tested and placed in service.\"   We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the facilities were in service.   The compressor has since been taken down because of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.   EE&amp;CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.   Based on our experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.   Today, we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not exceed our existing capacity.   Nominations are expected to exceed existing capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.   When the compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.   The downside:   we get no reservation charge at all.   (estimated loss:   $25,000/month)The upside:   in the long run we probably save face with our customers.From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to revoke our \"in-service\" announcement.   When summer weather kicks in, we'll probably have to allocate every day.   On our EBB we will have to give some reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an explanation anyway).   Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be triggered.   The downside:   shippers will never trust us again.   Also, we could be subject to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was \"in service\" when we knew it was not.   The upside:   on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.   (In July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not delivered).   We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption in mind.Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a memo for wider distribution, let me know.   For now, I think it's important to get a decision on one of the above options.   The longer we wait to get information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will be.   \n"

The Commission's order contained two conditions:   1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.   Transwestern accepted the   certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.   On January 18, 2000, Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.   Transwestern has already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure through a discount report.   \n"

This change effects both TAGG - Deal Capture and TAGG - Deal Clearing.In order to be ready for the commercial people in case they use the two legged Gas Dailydeal, I am requesting that your Gas Daily team input maybe 20-25 deals in TAGG - DealCapture using the new guidelines.   Ron Nolte has outlined below how the input process should be handled for these types of deals.I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday of next week so I am requesting that the Gas Daily team have these deals in by next Wednesday.Thanks for your help. ---",

The \"Link\" can be done from either leg 1 or leg 2. 4) The   confirm can only be created/revised/viewed/printed/faxed   from leg 1. 5) The clearing status of the deal can only be changed from leg 1. Please note that   any change to the status of either leg will be reflected on the other leg automatically; e.g., assume a confirm is created on leg 1,   the deal status of both   legs will display \"Generated\".   Then assume someone changes leg 2 in Deal Capture, the status of both legs in TAGG deal clearing will be automatically set to \"Pending - Revised after Generated\". \n"

Jose and Gigi's party was attended by more kids than ever.   There were a lot of West U parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.   We did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode &amp; Company BBQ, helped Gigi with the pinatas, and got home around 7.

I just wanted to drop a line and see how work,   your new apartment/roommate and Brendan are all doing.   All are wonderful I hope.   I realize this is somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San Diego ($999 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend of Dec. 15?   I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.   Regardless, this deal is good for travel through the end of February 20001, so...if it doesn't look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe I could make a visit mid-January or February.   Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.Susan\n"

      "body": "\nDear Citizens' Assistance Division:I live in the Houston Heights on the 8000 block of Cortlandt.   For the 3 years I've lived there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on my street, have been blocked.   Any time it rains, we have standing water for several days afterwards.   I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.   I have heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper crop of mosquitos this summer.   Standing water therefore poses a health concern for residents of the Heights this summer. Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the Heights?   Last year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, but got no response.   I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication that the City of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens. Any information you can provide would be appreciated. Sincerely, Susan Scott 815 Cortlandt St. (713) 853-0596 (daytime phone) sscott3@enron.com \n"

Kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given the responsibility of baby-sitting Corey and Travis.   Anyway, Trav's pledge class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.   The single guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.   Also, you've gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me (although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much younger).   I think 27-28 may be a better range.   Old enough to know who they are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached status on career focus.Talk to you soon,Susan\n"

You all know me well enough to know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).   Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special things.

I know this time of year has got to be crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well.   We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.   I'm in need of a good chat.Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about to pull your hair out.   Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).   Please tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.Lisa - Hey sweetie!   I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, but Jen said it went really well.   We need to get together soon I've missed seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings ons in your life.   Tell Brad I say \"Hi\" and I'll be glued to the TV set just like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the \"Fam\".   Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your Mom) is absolutely in love with him.   Keep me posted on your plans for the future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).   Also, I thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in your old hometown - Chicago.   Any thoughts?Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at myself for letting that happen.   Please write back soon and let me know how school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely out of touch) are all doing.   My guess is you're going through exams as well right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success.\n"

      "body": "\nWell, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT good.   Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm right.   With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.   My condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie co-workers through this trying time.Susan(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are an \"Ag\" man now.)\n"

She took a   &lt; &lt; break from the slots for dinner with her husband in   &lt; &lt; the hotel dining room.   But first she wanted to stash   &lt; &lt; the quarters in her room.   &lt; &lt;\"I'll be right back and we'll go eat,\" she told her   husband   &lt; &lt;and she carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt; As she was about to walk into the elevator she   &lt; &lt;noticed two men already aboard.   Both were black.   &lt; &lt;One of them was big ... very big ...an intimidating   &lt; &lt;figure.   The woman froze.   Her first thought was:   &lt; &lt;These two are going to rob me.   &lt; &lt;Her next thought was:   &lt; &lt;Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice   gentlemen.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized   her.   &lt; &lt;She stood and stared at the two men.   &lt; &lt;She felt anxious, flustered, and ashamed.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;She hoped they didn't read her mind, but knew they   &lt; &lt;surely did; her hesitation about joining them on the   &lt; &lt;elevator was all too obvious.   Her face was flushed.   &lt; &lt;She couldn't just stand there, so with a mighty effort of   will   &lt; &lt;she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed   &lt; &lt;with the other foot and was on the elevator.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;Avoiding eye contact, she turned around stiffly and   &lt; &lt;faced the elevator doors as they closed.   A second   &lt; &lt;passed, and then another second, and then another.   &lt; &lt;Her fear increased The elevator didn't move.   Panic   &lt; &lt;consumed her.   My God, she thought, I'm trapped and   &lt; &lt;about to be robbed.   Her heart plummeted.   &lt; &lt;Perspiration   poured from every pore.   Then ... one   &lt; &lt;of the men said, \"Hit the floor.\"   &lt; &lt;Instinct told her: Do what they tell you.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she   &lt; &lt;threw out her arms and collapsed   &lt; &lt;on the elevator carpet.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt; A shower of coins rained down on her.   Take my money   &lt; &lt;and spare me, she prayed.   More seconds passed.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;She heard one of the men say politely, 'Ma'am, if   &lt; &lt;you'll just tell us what floor you're going to,   &lt; &lt;we'll push the button.'   The one who said it had a   &lt; &lt;little trouble getting the words out.   He was trying   &lt; &lt;mightily to hold in a belly laugh.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;She lifted her head and looked up at the two men.   &lt; &lt;They reached down to help her up.   &lt; &lt;Confused, she struggled to her feet.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;\"When I told my man here to hit the floor,\" said the   &lt; &lt;average sized one, \"I meant that he should hit the   &lt; &lt;elevator button for our floor.   I didn't mean for   &lt; &lt;you to hit the floor, ma'am.\"   He spoke genially.   &lt; &lt;He bit his lip.   &lt; &lt;It was obvious he was having a hard time not laughing.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;She thought: my goodness, what a spectacle I've made   &lt; &lt;of myself.   She was too humiliated to speak.   She   &lt; &lt;wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed her.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable   &lt; &lt;gentlemen for behaving as though they were going to   &lt; &lt;rob you?   She didn't know what to say.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;The 3 of them gathered up the strewn quarters and   refilled her bucket.   &lt; &lt;When the elevator arrived at her floor, they   &lt; &lt;insisted on walking her to her room.   She seemed a   &lt; &lt;little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she   &lt; &lt;might not make it down the corridor.   At her door   &lt; &lt;they bid her a good evening.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;As she slipped into her room she could hear them   &lt; &lt;roaring with laughter while they walked back to the   &lt; &lt;elevator.   The woman brushed herself off.   &lt; &lt;She pulled herself together and went downstairs for   &lt; &lt;dinner with her husband.   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;The next morning flowers were delivered to her   &lt; &lt;room-a dozen roses.   Attached to EACH rose was a   &lt; &lt;crisp one hundred-dollar bill.   The card said:   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt;Thanks for the best laugh we've had in years'   &lt; &lt;It was signed,   &lt; &lt;   &lt; &lt; Eddie Murphy   &lt; &lt; Michael Jordan   &lt; &lt;   &lt;\n"

One of the guys I knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.   Since I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London Emily and I pretty much just hung out.   We went out to eat Friday night and then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish and chips).   Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.   Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.   Hope everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place was a success.   I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.SusanPS - I think you're right about the California men.

      "body": "\n In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for project development:Retainer:   $1000/month plus expensesAccepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles):   Proposal $5000Each month TW actively negotiating project:   $15000/month (each project)Letter of Intent:   $5000Signed Agreement:   $10,000 Incentive Fee:   To be determined When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.   In his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services --- $3000/mo.).   This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only.   The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and third party \"identified by IGS under this agreement.\"   As you know, the \"identified by\" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW Commercial Group worked on the deal.   Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement. Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis.   This immediately eliminates the \"identified by\" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on. I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement.   If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project, as needed).   For each project, we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.   I've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion.   The numbers are Mark's; we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.   I've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent are of little value to Transwestern.   Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed.From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.   If Transwestern desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the following terms and conditions:1.   Retainer for project development:   $1000/month plus expenses.   Project development shall include but not be limited to:   research, due diligence, market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written proposal.   Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements.   Transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to terminate the project.   2.   If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal (or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the project].   \"Accepting the project\" means that the project meets Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion.   Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to completion.3.   If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project, it shall pay IGS $10,000.   Additionally, the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project).(I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.).\n"

Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis.

A warning:   lack of market power is very difficult to=20\rprove.   Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20\rmarket power, tried and failed.   The deck is already stacked against us in=\r=20\rTW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the=\r=20\rprice conditions in California.   However, we do need to analyze the=20\rpossibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=\r=20\rsystem.   Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=\rs=20\rto pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.\r Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?   Please let me know.   I=\rn=20\rthe meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.\r ***\r To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20\rrequest a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20\rshowing it meets the requirements outlined below.   If the Commission finds=\r=20\rall requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=\rke=20\rthe appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.\r=20\rApplication for declaratory order must include:\r 1.   Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20\rtreatment.   I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.\r 2.   A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20\rnecessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=\r=20\rthe services at issue.   The Commission requires a narrow definition of the=\r=20\rmarket=01(\"firm transportation\" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp=\roses=20\rwe might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20\rThoreau).   We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o=\rther=20\rpipelines are a \"good substitute\" only if shippers can obtain the same=20\rquality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such=\r=20\rservice at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20\r10%.   All relevant \"origin markets\" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)=\r=20\ras well as \"destination markets,\" and alternatives for shippers in those=20\rmarkets identified.   Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives=\r=20\rif they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=\r=20\rused TW.   Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good=\r=20\ralternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20\rquantity.\r 3.

      "body": "\nFYI   - Europe spends an average of $4-9 per person onthe arts compared with the US at .64 and declining.&lt;&lt; On NPR's Morning Edition, Nina Totenberg reported&lt; that&lt; if the&lt;&lt; &lt; Supreme Court supports Congress to cut the budget&lt; of&lt; the National&lt;&lt; &lt; Endowment of the Arts, it is in effect the end of&lt; NEA. This situation&lt;&lt; &lt; creates&lt;&lt; &lt; great concerns about Congressional funding for&lt; creative arts in&lt; America,&lt;&lt; &lt; since&lt;&lt; &lt; NEA provides major support for NPR (National&lt; Public&lt; Radio), PBS&lt; (Public&lt;&lt; &lt; Broadcasting System), and numerous other creative&lt; and performing&lt; arts.&lt;&lt; If&lt;&lt; &lt; NEA is lost or weakened, our lives will be&lt; similarly&lt; diminished.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; In spite of the efforts of each station to reduce&lt; spending costs and&lt;&lt; &lt; streamline their services, some government&lt; officials&lt; believe that&lt;&lt; &lt; the funding currently going to these programs is&lt; too&lt; large a portion&lt; of&lt;&lt; &lt; funding for something which is seen as not&lt; worthwhile.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; Currently, taxes from the general public for PBS&lt; equal $1.12 per&lt; person&lt;&lt; &lt; per year, and the National Endowment for the Arts&lt; equals $.64 a year.&lt;&lt; &lt; A January 19995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll indicated&lt; that 76% of&lt;&lt; &lt; Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only&lt; to national&lt; defense&lt;&lt; and&lt;&lt; &lt; law enforcement as the most valuable programs for&lt; federal funding.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; Each year, the Senate and House Appropriations&lt; Committees each have&lt; 13&lt;&lt; &lt; subcommittees with jurisdiction over many programs&lt; and agencies.&lt;&lt; &lt; Each subcommittee passes its own appropriation&lt; bill.&lt;   The goal each&lt; year&lt;&lt; is&lt;&lt; &lt; to have each bill signed by the beginning of the&lt; fiscal year, which&lt; is&lt;&lt; &lt; October 1.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; The only way that our representatives can be aware&lt; of the base of&lt; support&lt;&lt; &lt; for PBS and funding for these types of programs is&lt; by our making our&lt;&lt; &lt; voices heard.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; Please add your name to this list and forward it&lt; to&lt; friends who&lt;&lt; &lt; believe in favor of what this stands for.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; The full list will be forwarded to the President&lt; of&lt; the United&lt; States,&lt;&lt; &lt; the Vice President, and the Speaker of the House,&lt; whose office has in&lt;&lt; &lt; the past been the instigator of the action to cut&lt; funding to these&lt;&lt; &lt; worthwhile programs.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; This petition is being passed around the Internet.&lt;&lt; Please add your&lt; name&lt;&lt; &lt; to it so that funding can be maintained for the&lt; NEA,&lt; NPR, and PBS.&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt; THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO MAKE INTERNET TECHNOLOGY&lt; WORK&lt; AS A VOICE IN OUR&lt;&lt; &lt; DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM.

If you don't end up coming in tomorrow I'll get with IT and try and figure out a way to email you these files.   Give me a call at 713-853-14555 if you need anything.I went ahead and attached a copy of your P&amp;L from Friday if you want to take a look at that.   I tried calling you with the number, but I never got an answer.

      "body": "\nHey,Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming the place is pretty close to our area of town).   I finally got into the parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car looking nice.Hope things are well with you.   I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as though he is extremely busy these days.   I'm guessing the story's much the same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.   Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.SusanBy the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU - one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.   Oh well, c'est la vie.\n"

Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat foryou.   We had a good time on Saturday.   It is always fun to be on sixthstreet close to halloween, even more freaks come out.OK enough stalling.   I just thought something needed to be said aboutwednesday.   We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probablynever see or talk to one another ever again.   I don't like that solution.My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes missout on opportunities.   So the traditional me would say it was just one nightand didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.   One thingthat I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't beintimidated.   You have a very strong personality and I can see wheresomebody could easily be intimidated.   Along with that comes someone who issmart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whetheryour at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.   The one thing I know aboutyou is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary waybecause I know that isn't high on the priority list.   I also know that if Iwould have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting herewriting this email.When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be thathard.   I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed achange.   Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respectyou sometimes get it is understandable.   The thing I'm going to miss themost are all the friendships I have built working in that group.   Sometimesthe toughest times are when you really get to know someone.   But the hardestthing now is that I will not be around you.   I know that sounds really badbut the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting nextto each other.   We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easierknowing you were there.   I really think the best times I had in Houston werethose couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.   I alsoknew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing toget involved.   I really regret that decision right about now.Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know thatI'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to sharethis info.   I do think some things need to be said or else the other personwill never know.   You are a great person and even though the chips arestacked against me I needed to let you know this.   I understand that yourunder a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.   Theone thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and stillooking then you need not look any further.So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talkto you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less knowwhere to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to GrueneHall then let me know.   I also don't want to be put in one of your stalkercategories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me asthe next SP.Take care and have a good week.KyleBy the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, atleast it is number one in my book.___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com.Share information about yourself, create your own public profile athttp:///profiles.msn.com.\n"

Call or email with any insights.SusanSusan M Scott09/21/2000 02:38 PMTo: ehillegeist@hotmail.comcc:   Subject: We have closure! (well, sort-of)I'm soo good.   The chosen path was cool, indifference.   So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a really good showing.   I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:000.   About 8:000 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of someone.   Can you believe it?   He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.   Anyway, Kevin saw me and came over to chat.   He informed me that \"our friend Ted should be there shortly\" to which I responded, \"You would know better than me at this point\".   The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.   He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.   I said there really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 weeks.   Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head and cause a big scene.   When I said no, I think he was genuinely disappointed.   I said in order for me to do something like that I would have to care about the \"loss\" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have cared a bit more, with each passing day the \"loss\" seems less and less like much of a loss.   Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.   To go even further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date Ted nor any of his \"girl-friends\".   He said that while he thought Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't good dating material.   I agreed with Kevin saying \"Ted is a great guy, he just makes a lousy man\" (don't you like that one?).   I then went on to say \"Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?\".   Kevin: \"Much bigger and much better.\"   About this time my parents showed up...the plot thickens.   I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.   The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when \"dum-da-dum-dum\" Ted shows up.   He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eye-contact with me.   I give him a \"hey\" and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant \"how's it going?\".   He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.   He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening.   The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with \"my group\" for quite a while before going to join Ted.   My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished.   It really was a great night.   I would almost say I was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).   So, when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to say good-bye to Kevin.   It was awesome.   Ted's sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair.   Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even make eye-contact.   I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.   Needless to say I was very hung over today.   Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter ass-hole.   So I'm done.   And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces.   Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.   I bought my ticket today ( I think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - $450 before taxes).   I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:000 a.m. Friday the 6th and depart about 111:000 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.   I'm very excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.   I leave the activities in your capable hands.   ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren and Nick at some point).\"Single again\" SueBear in mind this next email wasn't sent until Friday afternoon (a full day and a half after the Steak Night debacle).Susan M Scott09/222/2000 03:56 PMTo: julieg@qualcomm.com, ehillegeist@hotmail.com, Monique Sanchez/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: You guys are not going to believe this...I am refraining from responding to this until I have had time to ponder things this weekend.---"

Your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big   way. You want to know more and experience life   on a richer level. You're not the same person   you were even a year ago. You understand more   about yourself. Be open to travel, moving,   advanced training, and additional contact with   media and publishing. The word is out, Aquarius   --- and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the   mail. . . .\n"

The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts.   The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.   In limiting the right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate.   Shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract.   In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.   Such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an \"as amended\" basis).   Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract.   \n"

I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using their system) to access South Needles.   Obviously we will need to flesh this out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.   I will discuss it with Jeff when he returns.   My apologies for the delay.

Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.   If you think this passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.   My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as \"firm\" or \"interruptible\" since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except to assure us over the phone that it is firm!   I'd like to check to see if PNM is comfortable with all this before we file anything.   Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15.\n"

The Commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.   Specifically, the Commission stated:   The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will not, however, allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped.   Thus, the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.

Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.   Paragraph 13 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) provides that either party may terminate the OBA \"at the end of the primary term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice\" to Burlington.   (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 19994 and has since gone month-to-month.)2.   On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.   The 12/31/92 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term.   This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.   However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement \"may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the OBA between the parties is terminated.\"As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first.

I've answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.   If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call.?   Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights by permanently releasing this contract?   YES.?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?   YES.? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.   The shipper could even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?   The option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport rate.   If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's \"negotiated\".   Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.   We are not 1000% positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.\n"

      "body": "\nSouthern Trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $1555,000,000, a pipeline project consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from ARCO.   Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.   The pipeline system would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone.   The East Zone, which will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will have 87,5000 Dth/d of available capacity.   The West Zone, wholly within California, will have 120,000 Dth/d.   Southern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July 28,2000.   An optional certificate application does not require any showing of market need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to Oct. 19998 during which it received 222 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of demand.   The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the capacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with its affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East Zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are \"being negotiated\" with prospective shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in both the East and West zones.   TW is an intervenor in this docket so I have received everything that has been filed.   I have no further information about any further subscription of capacity.   I also have no information regarding any progress that has been made on construction.If you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at FERC, or if you have any other questions, please let me know and I'll see what I can find.   I've got the entire environmental report in my office if we need that for any reason!\n"

For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days, is it accepta=\rble to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days, or should=\r TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance?\r =09Answer:   The tariff doesn't say.   I believe this is a business decision.=\r   Would we rather charge the same rate every day, or are both parties OK wi=\rth taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day?   My understa=\rnding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the s=\rame day.   I also understand that, rather than documenting the rate in a con=\rtract or other writing, we rely on our posting.   If we change our practice =\rand start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate, I recommend at =\ra minimum that we notify our customers in a posting.   From a legal standpoi=\rnt I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet, e-=\rmail or other writing.   While we may be indifferent (after all, Form M says=\r the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary), document=\ration of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises.\r =09Another thing:   There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers =\rthe posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance, and ot=\rher shippers the posted rate from day to day.   However, there can be no dis=\rcrepancy among similarly situated shippers.   To avoid the appearance of dis=\rcrimination, I'd recommend choosing one method or the other, if that is fea=\rsible from a business standpoint. =20\r =09Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers, =\rhere are my recommendations:\r =09My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be =\rsomething to this effect:   BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL B=\rE CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE.   (If this looks =\rawkward to you let's discuss a better way to say it.)\r =09I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes.   However, if it is possible=\r to do an e-mail or fax, it could read:   The rate applicable to Contract No=\r. ___ on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate=\r posted on Transwestern's website for that day.   Another option might be ju=\rst to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement; it wo=\ruld not have to be done for each deal.\r 2.   If we have the following situation:   Shipper A has parked 10,000 dth fo=\rr a week and wants to move it out; Shipper B wants to ride 10,000 dth; we c=\ran only accommodate schedule activity totaling 10,000 dth --- who gets prior=\rity?\r =09Answer:   Shipper A should have priority because it has the greatest tota=\rl cost commitment to TW in accordance with Sheet 37E of the tariff.\r   \n"

The allocation process I do not think =\ris the problem. It is the way the rates are used today for PNR. Today, the =\ronly rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tari=\rff rates. If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t=\rhe range of dates of the specific deal, then the rates must be loaded that =\rway in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation=\r process. If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate, then it=\r looks for the next level which is your posted rates, if no posted rates ar=\re found, then it looks for tariff rates on PNR. It sounds like to me that T=\rW will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra=\rtes for each deal sheet on a daily basis &amp; load the total specific contract=\r deal rate in CBS.   Please let me know if there are other problems in the a=\rllocation process itself.\r Thanks Ramona\r ---Original Message---\rFrom: =09Bodnar, Michael =20\rSent:=09Monday, April 16, 20001 2:28 PM\rTo:=09Betancourt, Ramona ; Medeles, Gerry; Kowalke, Terry\rCc:=09Nacey, Sheila; Blair, Lynn\rSubject:=09RE: PNR questions\r Regarding my meeting invitation...I hope this helps.\r I've had a series of e-mails with Marketing, Legal and Regulatory regarding=\r TW PNR in an effort to finalize the process and procedures.

I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law (it sums everything up pretty well).   Let me know if you want to grab coffee, a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL tomorrow.   Well, we met and had dinner last night.   NOTHING of importance was discussed during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were leaving that any actual \"talking\" occurred.   Here are the basics...- There is definitely no \"us\" anymore...and I quote \"sometimes these things just fade out\"- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still don't- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond   2 mos. in those three years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated quite a bit) - Can you say issues?- He told me \"I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do with you, it's all me.\"   Of course I agreed with him saying \"I know it's you Ted, I don't have any problems.\" (He got a chuckle out of that one)- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of things in the beginning- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still really enjoyed hanging out and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that...not very healthy for me) So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his life that he has not completely dealt with yet, and might never deal with completely)Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.   I'll talk to you soon.SusanBy the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and maybe just a little harsh)Talk to you soon, Jen.\n"

Right now, we are in the midst of several internal control reviews related to various risk areas. We are currently testing the risk that NNG and TW reserves (regulatory, legal contingencies, etc.) are inappropriately valued and/or established.   One of the controls that Accounting cited to mitigate this risk was that both Legal and Rates reviewed the NNG and TW FERC Form No. 2s prior to issuance.   Harry Walters and Allen Joe mentioned to us that there is no formal \"sign-off\" or approval process by Legal and Rates of the Form 2s, but instead, drafts were sent to the groups and any comments were then reviewed with Accounting.   Your names were mentioned as those they sent the 1999 Form 2 drafts to for Legal to review (Maria-NNG and Susan-TW).   In order for us to test this control, we need to confirm with your group that this type of review was performed for the 1999 NNG and TW Form No. 2s.   What role did you and your group play in this review?Please let me know if you have any questions.   Thanks for your time.Tony - AAx333050\n"

      "body": "\nChristine --- Here's a brief answer to your questions.With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable leeway here.   The order is also silent with respect to the effective restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain alternate (or primary) points.   Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.   (Our Global Settlement argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place on TW without   running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal rates) provisions of the order.   In other words, I think the Commission would see them as two separate kinds of service.As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.   I realize the order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until September 1.   Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized presentation to persons outside the company.   The meeting is still in the planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.   In the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer them.Christine Stokes03/02/2000 10:32 AMTo: Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc: Steven Harris/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Hyatt/ET&amp;S/Enron@Enron, Jeffery Fawcett/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Lorraine Lindberg, Lindy Donoho/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, TK Lohman/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON Subject: 637 Summary ItemsThanks Susan for the 637 summary.   Here are a couple of items that I need additional clarification on:1)   Segmentation -   You summarized \" Pipelines must allow segmentation to the extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff provisions ...   \"   Does this mean, for example, an Ignacio to California contract (i.e. 40,000 Dth/d at a $.20 total path rate) could be segmented by the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM/d from Ignacio to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM/d from Blanco to California?   If they could, would the $.20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80 MM/d ($.20) for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or would they only pay the $.20 applied to the contract's 40 MM/d MDQ?   Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this segmented basis, but unless the discount letter providing the $.20 specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths (?) if these paths are not already provided as \"alternate\" receipt or delivery paths?   2)   Peak &amp; OFF-Peak Rates. - You summarized \" The policy does not apply to long-term shippers with contracts for 12 or more consective months of service.\"   TW will eventually file for hourly rates, however, the parties most interested in this service will be marketers serving a generation station, or the generation station's own gas supply manager/purchaser.   Most likely these contracts WILL BE of a longer term nature than month to month or even seasonal.   I need to reconcile your summarized comment to what we will expect from the marketplace.Thanks for your feedback.   Since 637 is effective March 27th, I am eager to be able to speak intelligently to my customers regarding some of these more critical issues.   Thanks.\n"

If you want to add to this please don't hesitate to do so.   We will form a questionnaire tailored to your group's needs. The right candidate will desire an environment that will challenge them with new situations on a constant day to day basis.   This person would become bored and restless with routine.   This person would also enjoy learning at a relatively fast and voluminous rate. The candidate will rarely lose a train of thought despite interruptions and can return to the point at which a discussion or idea was disrupted.   There are techniques as well as questions that can address this. The person must indicate a high degree of dependability, endurance, follow-through, and persistence.   They must be equipped with an ability to cope with adversity and be willing to do what it takes to get it done.   They must not be adverse to working beyond the 45hr week.   It is difficult for the candidate to create a story that combines examples of all of these traits unless it truly happened.   If they have these traits, they have used them in the past. Relatively thick skinned.   How do they accept criticism and/or reprimands?   A desire to be in control of situations is also a desirable trait.   These applicants must want to make decisions and control outcomes almost all of the time.   Not to be confused with micro-managers or control freaks (yeah-buts).   Lastly, they must have an entrepreneurial focus.   They need to be the people that make it happen, with possibilities but without guarantees   of personal gain, a desire to take ultimate responsibility, and influence others to get it done and make them feel good about it.   The how, what, when, where, and why of being in a leadership role. We will start formulating the questions and the order in which they should be asked today.   Do you have any candidates in the near future?   We would be glad to help you with interviewing tips.   hgm\n"

Robert Guthrie09/13/2000 08:05 AMTo: Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc: James Centilli/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: CIAC   I can only address this from the tax position.   Books may differ from the noted treatment depending on the true facts.   I have a call to James Centilli for his thoughts.   I also have not reviewed any written language, so this is based on our conversations; therefore the facts may change depending on the final arrangement.Based on my understanding, the meter fee will be structured as a fee paid to TW for services and not to build the interconnect facilities.   Because El Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities TW will not record these fees as a CIAC for tax.   In short, the management fee is just normal operational type revenue.   The benefit to El Paso is that they avoid the gross-up because this payment does not fall under the guidelines of IRS Code Section 1118 (b).   However, please note that the management fee is still taxable to TW in the year actually received or deemed received.   It is just not classified as a CIAC for tax purposes.   The potential book benefit to TW is that the interconnect facilities built should be allowed as part of rate base because the assets were built by TW and not contributed from El Paso --- I have a call to James Centilli to confirm.Clarification on CIAC ( IRC 1118(b))).   This is a code section that governs for tax only how payments received from customers or potential customers for services that benefit the customer are treated for tax purposes.   For tax,   the money received is recognized in the year received or deemed received, and the asset is depreciated, normally 15 years, MACRS.   The Gross-up paid is the time value of money over the life of the asset and is paid by the customer requesting the service.   The Management fee structure will generate the same result as the CIAC for tax.   For tax, the money is received and taxed.   The money is then used indirectly to build the interconnect facilities that are deprecated over 15 years, MACRS for tax.   The piece missing is that El Paso avoids the gross-up of approximately $50,000.   The $50,000 becomes a lost cost to TW for doing the deal with El Paso.   The lost cost should be off-set in part from rate recovery.   I don't know how this piece will work --- James Centilli should be able to confirm.Let me know if we need to discuss further.   I am out of the office after 12:30 today to return on Monday.   I will check my voice mail.   However, If you need to move on this or need additional help,   please call me on my mobile number (832) 647-4610. \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   Susan Scott   09/12/2000 05:27 PM To: Robert Guthrie/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: CIACRobert, here is the beginning of a note I need to send to Drew Fossum explaining what we're doing with El Paso.   Can you elaborate on the \"meter fee\" approach?   I'm not sure I really understand what keeps it from being a CIAC, and why we get to include it in the rate base.   If you can add to this I would appreciate it, or just give me a call and we can discuss it further.   Thanks so much for your help.***El Paso Field Services wants TW to build interconnect facilities.   Estimated cost:   $280,000.   EPFS will contribute $165,000 pursuant to an interconnect agreement.   The Commercial Group would like to avoid the tax gross-up associated with a contribution in aid of construction.   The Internal Revenue Code expressly provides that contributions in aid of construction and other contributions made by a customer or potential customer (collectively, \"CIACs\") are not contributions to capital and thus are not excluded from gross income.   Accordingly, such amounts are required to be included in gross income.   EPFS has proposed, instead of the $165,000 being paid in a lump sum, that the contribution instead be paid in equal monthly installments as a \"meter fee.\"   Our tax department has advised me that while this approach does not absolve TW from tax liability on that revenue, it does have a couple of advantages.   It would remove the contribution from the CIAC category (why is it not a CIAC?)and TW would be allowed to include it in its rate base.   Additionally, TW would be allowed to treat the interconnect facilities as a depreciable asset.   \n"

Lindberg, Christine Stokes/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, TK Lohman/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Michelle Lokay/ET&amp;S/Enron@Enron Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLCTW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting between the parties.   The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving the project forward.Caithness CorporationCaithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety of business interests.   The company is essentially a financial vehicle for private investors.   Their energy segment currently owns 1,2000 MW of generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina jointly-owned by Florida Power &amp; Light.Big Sandy ProjectThe Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, Arizona.   The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 5550 MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of Transwestern's pipeline.   The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near valve station #10008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station #1.   The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.   There is a 5000 KV transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.   This line is one of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.   I've included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.   Also, on the site is a water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.   Water for the plant will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.   They have currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 5000 cfm.   The power plant will require approximately 3,5000 cfm of water.   In addition to the wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface water from the Big Sandy River.   The project may also purchase water from the Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and associated wash.   The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.   The area includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited agricultural and ranching interests.   Wickieup is a very small town with an estimated population of 2000.Project ScheduleGas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens   May 2000Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)   August 2000Arrange financing   December 2000EIS approval   March 20001Construction begins   April 20001Testing begins   July 20002Commercial Operation   November 20002There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power Administration (WAPA).   There is only one endangered/threatened species known to be present in the area.Lateral Pipeline AlignmentThe most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.   The alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed next month.   Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement for the pipeline.   The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right of way available.   Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.   Typically, pipelines require a 1000 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent right of way.   Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section line.   The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly necessitating deep burial and anchoring.   The other route would involve following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.   The only issue there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.Other Preliminary Project IssuesThere are other fundamental issues to address.   The original concept was to interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.   Transwestern's original estimate to construct a 16\" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was based on the following specifications:120 MMcf/d450 psig delivery pressure,9000 psig inlet pressureThe meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a higher 5550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse turbines).   In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at a pressure 1000-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.   In order to accommodate EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the design will likely change to a 20\" pipeline.Next Steps (responsible party/department) Task   Date Due Party/Dept.

Project   As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the mainline in Arizona.

However, the regulations (o157.204)   set forth Who may apply for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.   Therefore, would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate filing or is a case-specific certificate required?As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season required for the project?

      "body": "\nI agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental requirements are met.   The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an \"eligible facility\" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):   they are necessary to provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate.   The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,2000,000.   (Sec. 157.208).   If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 7&amp;copy; certificate.   I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able to find out:In the context of a 7&amp;copy; application, FERC generally requires use of existing Part 284 rates.   This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to construct the San Juan lateral.   TW requested a separate zone rate for the lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was not the appropriate forum.   The Commission stated, however, that it would be willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.   So TW made a Section 4 filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the lateral. Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau rates.As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.   However, if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll probably want to have an open season.   In any event, in the context of a 7&amp;copy; application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it would be to our advantage to sell 1000% of the new capacity.At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed.I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not sound right to you let me know.

The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff language and a proposed form agreement.Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.   I am distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue about the larger issues first.   A few that come to mind are whether we want to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future capacity for shippers.   Please let me know your thoughts on these and any other issues.   I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have resolved the substantive issues.   Thanks.\n"

Everything's going pretty well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard work is going to pay off.   In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty good right now.   There might be an opportunity for me to get into some structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).   Glad to hear things are still well with you.   Sounds like you're still the same old Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.   You'll have to let me know when you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.   It looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.

My comments are as follows:1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning theobligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to strikingthis.   The information is not to be used at any time other than for thepurpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease toacquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to useinformation it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believethat language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with thelanguage in the last sentence of Section 5 as well.2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that manydamages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be director ordinary, but rather consequential.   In addition, the right to recoverpunitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect againstblatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.   We also believe that weshould have three years to commence an action after termination.3.   Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate sinceTri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach andshould have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it isfamiliar with.Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.   We are opento discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position isreasonable and appropriate.Thanks,Dave Nocera   \n"

There is only one thing that seems subject to possible questions about the intent.? Paragraph 3, last sentence.? I suggest it be revised as follows: \"...and Transwestern's maximum rates shall apply on a daily, volumetric basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized.\" This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply.? As written now, someone could infer that ALL volumes go to max rates whenever ANY volumes are moved from/to an unspecified alternate point.? I am visualizing a nomination day with part of the volumes from Primary or one of these specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified alternate point. Then, just a general question.? Are any of these named alternates also delivery points, as well as receipt points??? Are there any delivery points in these areas that should be recognized?

We could put wording in the contact that each month the alternate rate to California will be set by Transwestern.

Attached is a draft of the Operating Agreement covering TW's operation of the metering station.   It's pretty much a standard form agreement for TW, with the possible exception of the exhibit defining the operating parameters of the South Point plant.   As I mentioned to you in our meeting in Pleasanton, the operating parameters exhibit is a useful tool for both companies to assist in identifing some of the operating conditions the plant might encounter and the ability of TW to load follow those conditions.   I made a number of assumptions regarding the burn rates for your facilities, especially the base rate and minimum rates.   You'll likely have to fine tune those numbers.   Also, I've yet to ask our engineers to secure the documentation necessary to complete Exhibit \"A\" from your 3rd party engineers.   We'll include it in the final version.   Please give me a call after you and your team has had a chance to review.   Thanks.\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nColleen, thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this.   I definitely had the wrong version of the agreement.Jeff confirmed by voice mail this morning that even though we already included the 5.4 language in the draft we sent him back in March, he does find it objectionable and will want to modify it, so he will be very interested in seeing your suggested language too.Please send your attachment \"CalpineO&amp;M 10-18-000 edits to draft03-20-000\".Again, thank you so much for your help with this.   (Calpine has finally woken up and realized they want this in place Nov. 1...)I will let you know how negotiations are shaping up.Colleen Raker10/18/2000 07:35 PMTo: Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Draft- Operating AgreementAttached below is Jeff Fawsett's   3/222/000 note to Calpine with TW's 3/20/000 draft of the Operating Agreement .   What changes if any did Calpine require to this draft?   Please note that Section 5.4 of the attached 3/20/000 draft is substantively identical to my further-revised Section 5.4 (with subsections A and B) that I forwarded to you a few days after Jeff's note to Calpine. From our meeting this morning I understand that Jeff appears adverse to Transwestern's claiming zero financial responsibility for damages to Calpine's Measurement and Control Facilities that result from TW's O&amp;M Services.   Consequently, I made some modifications to Articles 4 and 5 of the 3/20/000 draft for TW management's consideration.   These changes are noted in the attached document marked \"CalpineO&amp;M 10-18-000 edits to draft03-20-000\".   With my 10-18-000 revisions, TW places a limit on its liability to Calpine for loss or damage incurred by Calpine due to TW's Services, including loss or damage to the existing M&amp;C Facilities,   if and to the extent damage is caused by TW's negligent acts or omissions.   To complete my modification to Section 5.3, TW is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it is willing to assume in any contract year.   This amount could be the amount of Calpine's deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser amount.   Whatever the amount chosen, please remember that TW is self-insured for the first $2M, each occurrence.   Therefore, what is the amount of risk that TW is willing to pay out of its earnings if Calpine claims damage to its existing Facility due to TW's negligent operations?   That is the amount to insert in the blank space in Section 5.3.   FYI, the changes in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (b) and &amp;copy;, and the striking of Section 4.1 (d) do not create any substantive changes to the 3/20/000 draft.   I   made the latter changes for stylistic reasons and to correct typos and redundancies.   Please call me if you have any questions and to let me know the status of this document.   I have lost track of my notes on the status of TW Operations' review and approval of the list of Services included in Exhibit B; this needs to be determined by Jeff (or his designee) before the final definitive agreement is prepared for signing.---"

We are going to have to be able to put FTS-3 and FTS-1 capacity into separate buckets for purposes of allocation (that is, allocation due to circumstances such as, say, windowing by SoCal, &amp;c.).   Here's why.   If capacity became constrained on a given day and we allocated FTS-3 and FTS-1 together, FTS-1 service would essentially be enjoying the use of capacity created by EFBH.   This is all well and good until EFBH cancels at the last minute. Then you know what would happen:   FTS-1 would get cut because EFBH cancelled.   I am told that this would necessarily happen because once FTS schedules, it gets flowing gas rights.   To keep this scenario from happening, we feel that FTS-3 will have to be put in its own bucket and not get cut unless EFBH doesn't show up.Obviously, there is more to it than this, and Lindy and I would like to discuss it with you.   The systems people can't continue their work until we get this resolved.   Can we discuss this on Monday or some other time next week?   Thanks, SS\n"

I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.   The tariff language as it's currently written says we \"shall\" issue an OFO, and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty.If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there are any other issues we need to address, let me know.   Also, if you want to sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later this afternoon, I'm available.Thanks!S.Lindy Donoho02/01/2000 10:40 AMTo: Ramona Betancourt/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc: Steven Harris/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Sheila Nacey/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Lynn Blair/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Darrell Schoolcraft/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Elizabeth Brown/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Rivers/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Steven January/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Julia White/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, TK Lohman/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: EFBH Service approved   The effective date will be 2/23/2000.   Marketing does not anticipate offering the service until March 1, 2000.Susan is working on the compliance tariff sheets right now to be filed 15 days after the Order is issued (the Draft Order was issued last Thursday, so the final Order should be issued within a couple days after that).   The change I think you're referring to is the way we had anticipated prorating FTS-1 &amp; FTS-3 together when FBH is showing-up and now, we actually will match FTS-3 with the FBH space and FTS-1 will be allocated \"existing\" space as usual.   Susan is looking at the tariff language now and is thinking a language change may not be necessary.   She will be discussing with Mary Kay.   Regardless of which decision, it's being addressed.Were there any other tariff language changes? (I know FTS-3 should be added to 222.2, D, 1.   Susan and Mary Darveaux are reviewing all the GT&amp;C's to check for where FTS-3 &amp;/or FBH should be referenced, etc.)Please let me know.

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.000 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.000.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring   that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 20001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060   with any questions.

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =\rcost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=\rrrently $165.000 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=\royee cost of $94.000.\r If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name =\rto the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=\rade as spaces become available.=20\r The Saturn Ring   that connects the garage and both buildings will not be op=\rened until summer 20001. All initial parkers will have to use the street lev=\rel entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Ga=\rrage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an=\r exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20\r If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=\rrking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=\rail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=\r receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =\rnew garage.\r The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and=\r Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060   with any questions.=20\r (You must enter &amp; exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, w=\rill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell &amp; Smith.=\r)\r   \n"

The answer is no.\r With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=\rral Power Act (\"FPA\") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=\r governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=\r commerce, \"shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=\rtate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =\rinstrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=\rch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=\roing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=\rh in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =\rreference thereto.\"\r Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=\rve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =\rstate agencies and municipalities.\r With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=\r exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=\rrovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=\rs making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=\r rate schedules with FERC.   QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=\rthorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=\rst.   FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=\rket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =\rbut that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=\r a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=\r status is lost.\r Let me know if you need anything else.\r   Andrea M.

You see, Transwestern is a formal party to the GIR proceeding.   As such, we are currently involved (albeit indirectly) in negotiations with SoCal and other parties regarding the ability [and mechanism] for SoCal to recover costs to implement unbundled services on their system.   System pooling is one of those services. I'll defer to counsel on this, but in my humble opinion, I don't think it wise for TW to offer SoCal any kind of cost figure to base its estimates on.   First, its probably not good form for one party to the proceeding to give another party information that could prove to be prejudicial.   Secondly, and probably more practically, if Transwestern were of a mind to, it could intentionally skew the results of their survey. Unless collective wisdom feels differently, I'd suggest we politely decline on some reasonably nebulous basis, i.e. --- we don't know... we forgot... we really didn't account for it separately... it's been too long... the people who might have known are no longer here... whatever.   That way we don't appear uncooperative, just incompetent!   I'm kidding.   Just let me know how else I can help here.Lindy Donoho03/29/2000 12:000 PMTo: Jeffery Fawcett/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc: Tammy Jaquet/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Re: Estimate for Pooling Service on TWHere is some input from Lynn.---"

Please let me know if you have any comments.   Thanks for your help.I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and have the following points; 1.   FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at that time via Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the certification of the Kachina units.   FERC simply didn't ask any further questions in that proceeding.   The Operation &amp; Maintenance Agreements in place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.   TW feels the O&amp;M agreements would be adequate to answer any questions that possibly FERC might ask regarding this subject matter.   The Operational Control agreement was put into place in Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&amp;M Agreement which might slow down the process at that time. 2.   There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.   No regs or law address this situation.   Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&amp;M agreement is in place to accomplish control for TW. 3.   I also faxed you a copy of Section 19&amp;copy; of the NGA which indicates that the petition for rehearing does effect the status of the certificate.   Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.   I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as soon as I recieve it.

The Commission wants to see evidence of serious efforts to form RTOs that combine current RTO proposals and Entergy and SPP must file a report by May 25 addressing this scope issue.\to\tBulk power sales and purchase figures indicate that natural markets extend beyond the SPP RTO borders.

I never in my life imagined the intense impact an email could have.   They appear so harmless at first glance with no character or personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.   I really don't know what to say about the email.   If I didn't know what happened afterward I would have said it was very promising, but knowing what I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just confused.   I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us I would send it to him in a heartbeat.   But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo.   I fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email dialogue throughout the day.\n"

      "body": "\nMy several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on point.   The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:*** In Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (19997), Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made public. FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could terminate contingent on theoccurrence of certain events.FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (19996).***In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (19998), which involved a request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment but transportation contracts should not:   the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a differentfooting from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are subject to similar disclosurerequirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas sales in acompetitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under the assumption that the pipelineexercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that competition is from otherpipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting requirements. There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the context of Section 4 cases.   Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the next few days and let you know if I find anything.   \tFrom:   Drew Fossum   02/04/2000 10:43 AM To: Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc: Steven Harris/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Hyatt/ET&amp;S/Enron@Enron, Lorraine Lindberg/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Donna Martens/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Mary Kay Miller/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Keith Petersen/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, sstojic@gbmdc.com, fkelly@gbmdc.com Subject: Re: Gallup request for rehearing   Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the Commission.

FYI a little more background:   The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW's efforts to unbundle under Order No. 636, whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas.   In addition, we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as well as our de minimus sales function.   All Amgas does today is administer our sales function.   We never eliminated our sales function; we just transferred the administration of it to Amgas.   The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline's sales division be treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.   Our standards of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in any of the day-to-day operations of Transwestern's merchant function.   As a result, the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G.   FTS-2 transportation service is the unbundled no-notice transportation service the (former and current) sales customers received under Order No.   636.   I think we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function is even smaller than it was when we unbundled [true?] which is not enough work for an agent to perform and that we've brought it back in house and explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared operating employee under G.

This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC.   If we can save the $60,000/yr, it would be worth asking FERC for authority to simply use an ET&amp;S market services person to administer the farm tap sales from time to time, without any functional separation or other junk.   We could even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable that we are not going to expand the business.   The NN situation was different (I think) because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use of its sales rate schedule.   Would TW use the FTS-2 rate schedule?   We have never formally discontinued the TW sales function, right?   What do you guys think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver?   Has it ever approved similar small-volume waivers?   DF   \tFrom:   Susan Scott   03/02/2000 04:32 PM To: Drew Fossum@ENRON, Mary Kay Miller/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Dari Dornan@Enroncc:   Subject: Gas Sales on TW?I've been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas.   TW no longer has any gas purchase contracts, just a handful of sales contracts to persons who granted rights of way to TW.   Many of these parties don't even buy gas on a regular basis, but they still have the contractual right to do so.   We pay AmGas around $60,000/year to administer the contracts.   The AmGas contract is terminable on 30 days notice.I know that last year NNG re-established its pipeline sales division to make occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons (i.e. the base gas deal).   Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same?   Looks like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved, but would like to hear from you what all was involved behind the scenes --- in other words, was it as easy as it looked?   Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to waive the Section 284.286 requirements in this instance since the remaining sales contracts are so few and insignificant. Your comments would be most appreciated!\n"

How to define a good girl...or rather how do we define \"good\"\n"

Turns out there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there which would be much more in line with where I'd like my \"career\" to be going versus the other opportunities I was being offered.   Either way, I won't be going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really to speak of.   I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see them going anywhere.   Most of the guys around my age are still pretty insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to \"shape and mold them\" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.   And the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.

      "body": "\nHey Bronwyn,I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).   Glad to hear things are going well with you.   It was so neat to run into you in Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think he recognizes me.   I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next time I see him.   So what's new with you?   Have you moved?   I know you were thinking about LA a while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out there and are really having a good time.   Anyway, I completely understand the urge to try something new.   I too am thinking of making a move before next summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I really need to experience something different).   Speaking of which, Emily is in London going to graduate school right now.   I've already been to visit her once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.   I would actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.   As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.   I was seeing one guy for a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has issues and that he'd been married before.   Needless to say, that was pretty much the end of things.   It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.   How about you?Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch with.   Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she graduates.   Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas when she graduates.   Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a fellow med student there.   Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is living and working in Dallas.   Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely perfect for her.   That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.Talk to you soon,Susan \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   \"Bronwyn Tull\" &lt;bronwyn_tull@lycos.com&lt;   09/24/2000 09:25 PM Please respond to bronwyn_tull@lycos.comTo: sscott5@enron.comcc:   Subject: Hey Susan!Hi Susan!   How are you?   It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston!   I really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what your were up to.   I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.   Are you happy to be back in Houston?   (I guess you've been back for awhile now...)   How's your family?   Do you still talk to Emily?I've visited Houston every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the greatest time when I visit.   I'm trying to decide right now where I want to live.   I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've been thinking about LA.   I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.   I'm thinking about just playing in LA for about a year and then probably settling down in Houston.   We'll see...What else is going on with you?   Are you dating any one?   Do you still keep in touch with any Kappas?Well, sorry for all the questions, but I can't wait to hear from you...hopefully, we can stay in touch!Take care, Bronwyn(919) 345-5023Get your FREE Email and Voicemail at Lycos Communications athttp:///comm.lycos.com\n"

He said the break up of Ted's marriage wasn't \"ALL his fault\", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted gave me the night of our chat.   I also heard that he has worked his way around Enron a bit.   All in all very disheartening information.   Regardless, I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole situation.

I'll talk to you later when I get a better sense of what is going on.Ted&lt; &lt;A little girl was playing in the garden when she spotted two spiders&lt;mating.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Daddy, what are those two spiders doing?\" she asked.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"They're mating,\" her father replied.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"What do you call the spider on top, Daddy?\" she asked.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"That's a daddy longlegs.\" her father answered.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"So, the other one is a mommy longlegs?\" the little girl asked.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"No,\" her father replied. \"Both of them are daddy longlegs.\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; The little girl thought for a moment, then took her foot and stamped&lt;them&lt; &lt;flat.&lt; &lt; \"Well, we're not having THAT sort of shit in our garden.\"&lt; &lt;&lt;Susan M Scott08/30/2000 01:37 PMTo: Ted Noble/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: I'm such a rule breaker...Hey Pavarotti,Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big presentation tomorrow.   My day is going significantly better than yesterday so I am pleased.   Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.   By the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always get the two confused).Now for the rule-breaking.   I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I hope you can forgive my rudeness).   Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.Shorty- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.   Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.\n"

Case in point, took my Mom to see Hakeem's last game with the Roc=\rkets on one of the brokers (center court seats...she was thrilled) and am o=\rff to Vegas this weekend to \"meet\" with some of the power traders from Port=\rland.

Their chief concern is to prevent TW from becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never been our intention).   Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether this is something we could live with.   The Commission has expressed the same concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our proposal too.   Comments?   let me know.   \n"

Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=\r=20\rBaldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20\rTranswestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=\r=20\rimplementation/documentation.   Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=\r=20\rGovernor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=\r=20\rdidn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=\r=20\rratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.   He may ask the other=\r=20\rComprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.   Susan, Mar=\rk=20\rand I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=\r's=20\rrole in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=\r=20\rfirst before committing to anything.\r Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition\rMindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=\r=20\rPublic Utilities\rCommissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20\rmoderate\rapproach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=\rstem.\rIn his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=\rg=20\rof intrastate\rtransmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=\re=20\rless far-reaching\rInterim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=\rnd=20\rElectric and\rother parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20\rcomprehensive agreement in\rApril this year.\r But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=\r=20\rconsumer\rbacklash and giving competition a bad name.   The draft language notes that=\r=20\rthe first interim\rsettlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.\rRecent events =01&amp;lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20\rinvestigation, the unbundling\rof intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20\rtradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=\ro the=20\rdraft order.   =01&amp;This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=\rment]=20\rand we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=\r=20\runtil 20006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=\r=20\rwe believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=\r=20\rwith modifications, of the IS.=018\r The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=\r=20\rcapacity expansion\rby SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=\r=20\rare met.   El Paso\rEnergy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=\rl=20\rto automatically\rexpand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 1000 million cfd if a certain number of=\r=20\rcurtailments oc-curred. =20\rEl Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele=\rr=20\rwhen only certain customers would benefit. =20\rThe draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge=\r=20\rexpansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce=\rss.\r The draft decision would also:\r=01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&amp;windowing=018 process, which limits shipp=\rers=01, ability to=20\rchange nominations\rfor deliveries between receipt points on the system.

I was offered a job here in Houston trading and just couldn't pass it up.   However, I will definitely tell my friend Emily about the flat...she's always looking for ways to save a little bit of money.   I'll also keep my ears open for any Enronites who are looking for places to live.Actually, the reason I was going to email you was to let you know I'm coming over to visit again this June.   I will be in town basically the 6th through the 111th (flying in on the 5th and departing the 12th).   I hope you're in town at least some of that time...I'm still frustrated we never had a chance to hook-up last time.   Food for thought...there's an Eagles concert on the 9th and my friend already has tickets with some buddies... I'm was planning on just getting a single ticket and hopefully squeezing in with them, but if you have any interest please let me know and we could just get tickets together. Talk to you soon,Susan \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp.

I have no idea if this will pan out, but I amlooking for a roommate.   If you were comign over and might want to be myroommate, I would be super excited.   I live in a really cool area in tehmiddle of everything and do not want to have to give up the flat.   It isactually really cheap rent at ?2000 a week or so.   the little man who ownsit lives next door and keeps different flowers planted depending on theseason.If you are not coming, or just do not want to be my roommate, do   you thinkyou could keep your ears open for anyone you know who might be moving over.Do you think your friend who you were visiting might need a roommate?Think on it and let me know any feedback.Take care,Ashley\n"

In section 3 on page 3 we state that TW intends to contract for long-term capacity vs. short-term capacity and therefore we will have a higher priority and will not be the \"lowest priority on PNM\".   Please confirm that a contract for April to October is long term on PNM.

I have underlined the additional language   in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be underlined when provided to Phillips).

      "body": "\nFor the record, I have read Judge Biren's ruling, and contrary to what people might have said in the conference call on Friday, it is silent on the topics of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments.   The three-sentence e-mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the PHC at which time she will rule on the motion, and states that she might issue a further ruling prior to the PHC.   I think it is probably fair to expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at the PHC.Jeffery Fawcett04/07/2000 05:28 PMTo: Steven Harris/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Hyatt/ET&amp;S/Enron@Enron, Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EEES@EES, mbaldwin@igservice.com, Tim Aron/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Julia White/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: SoCal GIR settlement teleconI participated in a teleconference today at 3:000 p.m. with several members of the \"all-party\" settlement group.   The ALJ assigned to the GIR case, Andrea Biren, has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal's Motion to Extend the deadline for filing the all-party settlement.   Although I personally haven't seen the document yet, it was the primary focus of the meeting.According to accounts from the group, Judge Biren's ruling did not grant SoCal's motion for extension.   Rather, she will hear arguments on the motion during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday, April 111.   Judge Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the Commission.   Unfortunately, she is silent on what date the testimony would be due (originally, testimony was due on April 17).   In addition, Judge Biren's ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into something different during Tuesday's prehearing conference (ie. a different procedural schedule, or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol).The telecon group decided to do the following: (1) approach CPUC commissioner Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all-party settlement and ask him to intervene in favor of the extension, (2) go before Judge Biren on Tuesday (as a group, and individually, if necessary) and request that in leiu of a full scale testimony procedure, would she accept a process whereby, similar to what was done in the PG&amp;E settlement, parties file declarations in favor of one settlement versus another, and then the Judge supervises/conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the settlement?   If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process, one which arguably doesn't offer as complete a record in the case (which most on the call felt was the likely outcome), then would she agree to a schedule whereby she grants the SoCal motion, the all-party settlement is filed on April 17, then all parties, including the Norm Pedersen group, would have the chance to file testimony (only testimony, not additional declarations) indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons/logic, including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives, on or before May 5?As far as the all-party settlement document is concerned, SoCal will be forwarding a preliminary (as yet incomplete) draft for the parties to review, but not to comment on.   SoCal intends to circulate another, more complete version Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments/changes.   As far as Transwestern is concerned, I've spoken independently with the team --- Susan, Mark and Jeff Dasovich.   Each of us will review and provide TW comments to SoCal regarding the settlement document.   Susan will be representing TW at the Prehearing Conference on Tuesday.   Mark Baldwin will be there also to support Susan's efforts on Tuesday.   Susan and Jeff (and maybe Mark?) will try and hook-up Tuesday morning to compare notes and talk about the upcoming Commission PHC.Steve, between Susan and I, we'll continue to forward documentation and other materials regarding this case as well as to provide you with our comments and/or any drafts of testimony TW intends to file in this case. \n"

We have agreed that TWPLwould allocate the rate between fixed and variable components.   I havenever been clear on just when and how that will be done.   I have assumedyou would make that call, let us know, and it would be over.   Is thereany idea that issue would be a changing thing, or is it \"once done,always done\"?   Further, what factors do you use to make thatdetermination and what, if any, rules and regulations apply?

Operation's objective is a volumetric goal, but we are at risk for the gas price.   It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense.   TW's fuel expense is valued on our books at the TW systemwide index.   Should TW be hedging the fuel that we burn?   Jan-Aug, 2000 (acctg months) Y-T-D fuel expense is at $21MM ($2.6MM/month) at a total volume of 6.7 Bcf.   This summer, with high gas prices and Gallup in service, our fuel has been ranging $3.4-3.8MM a month.   Operations has objectives to minimize the fuel use, but not the price. How could we hedge our fuel used?   Would we sell all the fuel retained (hedge it as high as possible) and manage our fuel expense separately through its own purchasing and hedging (as low as possible) effort?   Could we have hedged some portion of our fuel usage last year for this year at $2.36 (like we hedged our excess fuel) and not be subject to the high prices we're seeing this summer?Do you think there is an opportunity here to manage our fuel expense more effectively?Susan,I think you had looked at TW's ability to buy/sell gas a few months back (when we were looking at fuel monetization).   What did the FERC Order say about under what circumstances TW could buy/sell gas?\n"

Probably we should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the replacement shipper.   This would probably have to go into our tariff someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to our current tariff provisions and practice.   Another solution might be to just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.

We had several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel discount   cash option to an acquiring shipper?   If we must offer this special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at this time.Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?   Could we default these \"02\" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using our existing tariff fuel %?   This would   make the process of trying to reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes scheduled &amp; paid for in cash...Tariff Sheet issue:   When you state in the tariff provision that \"The shipper may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a receipt point on shipper's service agreement\" Does this only apply to the shipper's primary receipt points?I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please let me know.Thanks Ramona\n"

As currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.   If we do intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).   If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.Any questions --- give me a call.S.Christine Stokes08/03/2000 09:26 AMTo: Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: TW IOS PostingSusan, please review the following IOS posting.

Based on the contract, the overrun rate is usually the same as the firm rate so I don't believe there is a revenue issue.   Keep in mind, when a day is limited the mdq is \"reduced\" systemiatically   to that level so anything greater is overrun.

The tariff is vague in regard to partial days.   It appears we could call a partial limited day   based on a percentage of the MDQ or a specific volume level however once we have announced the firm level haven't we made a commitment only to that level of MDQ on a firm basis and any other volumes that might flow would be regarded as overrun?   Glen   \tFrom:   Susan Scott   05/16/2000 111:444 AM To: Mary Kay Miller/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Mary Darveaux/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Glen Hass/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc: Drew Fossum@ENRON Subject: TW LFTI have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks ago.   One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.   If a Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest could be scheduled IT.   Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me.   As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.   Similarly, if TW were to notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this ---   a Limited Day is defined as a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of gas is transported.   Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).   If so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what you think.SS\n"

Obviously some of these items aren't applicable in the PNR context; the language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.   For PNR we would just multiply rate times number of days the service will be used.   Practically speaking, I'm not sure how this is done if you have an interruptible service with no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the number of days in the contract term.   If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.

Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.   (Don't we want everyone to get approval ahead of bidding?).Page 2:   you state that \"individual bid transactions are kept confidential.\"   What is confidential:   the identity of the shipper?   the bid itself?   In TW's IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of the shipper.   We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend online bids be posted in real time.   I notice you call them \"sealed bids\" on page 4 --- not true if we're going to show them.Page 3:   why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?   Especially since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.   Our credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 2 and 4 on bid day.If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).Page 7:   \"an\" Capacity Trading Agreement should be \"a\" Capacity Trading Agreement.Page 8:   So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for online submittal at some point in the near future.Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each bid.   A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.   They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or prior to, the first bid.   I recommend stating \"You must submit a Request for Service prior to making your initial bid\" so they don't think they have to submit a new one every time they revise their bid.Page 9:   Under \"When TW will Respond\":   need to specify how notification will be sent.   Page 14:   Column that says \"Price\" should say \"Rate\" (for a second there we thought you were talking about gas prices).   Also, please use example rates that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.2999 would be great...)Thanks for all your hard work on this.

Assuming we could satisfy the Texas Eastern criteria (which would be tough given that this is a firm service, unlike our market center service), we still need to think about PNM's situation.

There is some new law on use of capacity on a Hinshaw for interstate service, only I think it involved a capacity lease instead of service agreements.   I think it was one of the Northeast pipeline cases involving CMS.   Does PNM know that we would use their service for interstate transportation?

This would effectively operate as an expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.   TW would acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post other capacity.   Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco --- in other words, the total path used by shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.   Shippers wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.   In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-3888 because it is more specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other pipelines' capacity.   I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet all the Texas Eastern criteria.I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a letter to FERC.   It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our successful Market Center Services filing.   I'm not yet sure where we will include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   \"Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.   The cost incurred for acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. ___.   Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such services.\"After you've reviewed the attached, please let me know your overall substantive comments and let's talk about the best way to proceed.

(by contrast, williams bought about 0.1 bcf/day at an average rate of $.207.)   el paso released this information via a a press release without any prior approval from ena.   julie, please don't hesitate to fill any holes or (unintended) innaccuracies.the situation is complicated by the fact that california is currently in the midst of intense negotiations over restructuring the state's gas industry.   the negotiations have been going on for about 8 months and have been very contentious.   socal has teamed with indicated producers, california manufacturers association, and muni generators from southern california to push a very \"go slow\" approach that is (surprise) quite friendly to larger users.   enron is teamed with western hub storage, wild goose storage, calpine, southern california edison, green mountain power, the city of vernon, and spurr/remac (provides services to california's k-12 school system) under an alliance called \"california alliance for competition\" (snappy, i know).   the cac proposal is pushing, among other things, a single, state-wide market for transport, storage and balancing, including tradeable rights in a secondary market.indicated producers has been aggressive and hostile toward marketers---as has cma---throughout the negotiations.   ip's bile has not been reserved solely for enron, however.   one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip launched against el paso at ferc regarding el paso's nom process.   (i believe ena filed in support of the suit.)   el paso is losing that one and will likely change its nom process sooner rather than later.i think it's important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent message on the ena deal and coordinate what we're saying about that deal with the other gas issues on the table.   i'm assuming that if there's anything we can do to keep harvey morris (and california) from mucking up the deal, the better.   i know harvey well.   i'm not sure, given his quotes, there's much \"educating\" to be done, but may make sense to meet with him, nonetheless.   more important, indicated producers is the real---and biggest---problem.let me know if you folks think there'd be value in briefly discussing the issue.best,jeffKevin Hyatt@ENRON12/30/999 10:51 AMTo: Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EEES@EES, Joseph Alamo/SFO/EEES@EEScc:   Subject: The El Paso Controversy ContinuesCPUC attorney Harvey Morris obviously has NO CLUE on how the transportation business works.---",

Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of Transwestern Pipeline   and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation capacity to the   southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for the California   Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest today. Between   the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm capacity from the   San Juan and Permian basins to California.   For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity represents a   worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and Trade, who has   held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. \"At least then   there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now it's Enron, the   owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes.\"   But \"what's even worse,\" he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision in the contracts. It   stipulates that \"after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, it has to share the   proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So effectively, Enron and   El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the transportation rate   differential between the California border and the Southwest producing basins.\"   The two pipeline companies \"that have for decades competed with each other in carrying   Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's anticompetitive, and   there's no way FERC should approve it,\" Morris said. He recalled the basis differential   between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up by 17% during   19998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity into California.   This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes.   \"At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain the same   anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts,\" Indicated Shippers noted, but   a \"closer review and analysis\" reveals the anticompetitive effects of the revenue-sharing   provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts \"are not only similar\" to those of the hotly   contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy case, \"but are   increased...due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing affiliate of El Paso's   primary interstate pipeline competitor,\" Transwestern.   Both the RRM and RSP \"operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and its competitors   to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act to drive down the   basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity,\" Indicated Shippers told   FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes producers   Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and Phillips   Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas Marketing.   FERC \"should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred in allowing the   El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after finding that the   contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court of Appeals].   That same error should not be repeated here,\" the producers and marketers said.   The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is a little bit   unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following Dynegy. \"When the   Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. We thought   FERC did a very inadequate job then...This time around we're asking for FERC to   summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a strong stand right at   the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering under the Dynegy   situation. And this is even worse.\"   In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC has asked that   an \"anti-hoarding condition\" be included in the contracts, which would require Enron to   release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher than what it's paying   El Paso for the capacity. \"They must make a little profit,\" Morris noted. \"We're confident   Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity...so there's going to be unused   capacity.\"   The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point for the Block II   portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&amp;E-Topock in keeping with the terms of the   19996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed fully with   Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), which accused   El Paso of violating the 19996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use SoCalGas-Topock as   a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They contend the alleged   violation is included in the Enron contracts.   He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back Block II capacity   after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific Gas and Electric   (PG&amp;E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy the right to   do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the decision violates the   19996 settlement under which PG&amp;E paid $54 million to preserve the right of the pipeline's   shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its service territory.   The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would enable Enron   to \"just sit on the capacity,\" thereby withholding idle Block II capacity from the market.   Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II capacity   provisions of the 19996 rate case, as well as \"exacerbate\" the primary firm delivery point   capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now.   The CPUC accused El Paso of \"deliberately\" filing the Enron contracts at FERC just   before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline \"is trying to sneak one of the most   controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that protests would be   minimized,\" said Morris. \"They did this with the Dynegy contracts two years ago. They   have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for people to protest and   harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect.\" ,Copyright 1999 Intelligence Press Inc.

Pursuant to Sempra's Gallup Expansion Agreement allowing Sempra the right to \"call\" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to availability, at a $.30 rate,   Sempra has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term.   Sempra's blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,5000 Dth/d of capacity at $.30/Dth (their \"call\" capacity) and 1,5000 Dth/d of additional Needles capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth.Non-standard provisions contained in Sempra's original Gallup expansion Agreement   are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3 and 4: Paragragh 3 grants Sempra the ability to have alternate delivery points in Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where SoCalGas' \"window\"   can be shown to reduce Sempra's nominated deliveries to SoCalGas.   Sempra must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from SoCalGas indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate delivery capacity at the discounted rate.   If written confirmation is either not provided or Sempra elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport shall be the discounted rate plus $.01.Paragragh 4 grants Sempra the ability during the term of the July - October transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from SoCalNeedles to PG&amp;E/Topock, Mojave /Topock, or to the potential SWG interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification period.   Sempra may also have the ability to return to the SoCalNeedles delivery during this term subject to the described conditions as well.Please indicate you approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.

I am the marketing director in Houston for Transwestern Pipeline.   I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send me only those tariff page copies slated for \"insertion\" into our tariff books and not the pages that are \"submitted for filing\"?   My reason is this: by the time the \"submitted for filing\" pages get to me, it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway) and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed.If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I understand.   However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I do?   If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and distribution costs.Let me know what you think.thanksKevin Hyatt713-853-5559\n"

Maximum available delivery capacity   of 12,000 Dth/d at Needles, Ca.   Remaining may be chosen between   PG&amp;E and Mojave.

Remaining may be chosen between   PG&amp;E and Mojave.Bidders may bid on either a 1-part or a 2-part rate structure for the entire capacity amount posted.   No partial volume bids are accepted.   Bid packages are considered mutually exclusive.   No minimum bid rate is posted therefore Transwestern is not obligated to accept any bids if the bids are valued as unacceptable.

      "body": "\nDrew --- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before.One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all --- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying.   The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.   So if a shipper wants the Needles space it has to take the Topock space too.   This looked like a clear case of tying to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the Topock space.   That'll be true during the IOS too --- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.   This is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable Topock space is part of that package.   Does this make sense to you?   If not, give me a call.   \tFrom:   Drew Fossum   07/17/2000 01:35 PM To: Susan Scott/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Transwestern IOS Approval Requestpls let me know if this looks ok to you.   thanks df---"

Interest is high, and numerous questions have been raised at each meeting.   The presentation can be given in 50 minutes if questions are limited.   It has taken up to 3 hours due to the amount of questions from the attendees. One   focus of these meetings is to give the field staff a better understanding of the impact   UAF has on our bottom line (TW) and   the impact it has on our shipper costs (NNG). Yesterday, 10/4/000 I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the financial group in Houston to discuss UAF.   Coming out of that meeting was a request to schedule a Houston presentation on \"UAF Fundamentals\".   This has been done, and will be at 1 PM on Oct. 18, 2000. (Place yet to be determined.)Two Questions:Is there any interest in having me give the presentation in Omaha???Do you have any staff in Houston that you would like   to invite to the 10/18 presentation???Copy of the presentation if you are interested:   Thanks   Steve   378885\n"

NOTHING of importance was discussed during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were leaving that any actual talking occurred.   Here are the basics...- There is definitely no \"us\" anymore...and I quote \"sometimes these things just fade out\"- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still don't- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond   2 mos. in those three years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say issues?- He told me \"I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do with you, it's all me.\"   Of course I agreed with him saying \"I know it's you Ted, I don't have any problems.\" (He got a chuckle out of that one)- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of things in the beginning- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My dignity (I handled just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.   I'll talk to you soon.SusanBy the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and maybe just a little harsh)\n"

The other guy I mentioned in the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll get to see him there as well.   Plus, in November I'm going to visit my brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.   The globe trotting continues.Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.   I wish I could be there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this weekend.   I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of them.   Talk to you soon.Susan- - Deep down I think I knew there was something wrong with him.

As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.   Turns out my trader went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.   Even without the connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my learning all I can about his book.   Hopefully, after I get the daily routine down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).   I hope things are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.   If that is the case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate your current position in life.   Believe me over the last two months I have had ample opportunity to do just that.   Just let me know if I can return the favour you once did for me.   Have fun at y'alls Happy Hour tonight.P.S.

I opened it in betweenclasses, but never got back to my comouter and was out eating with a firmuntil 111:000.   I will be glad when all of this is over.The jury is split on what you should do.   Knowing myself, I would want toknow what happened...   i.e. what's the matter with him?   I think I would askhim--- in a non-confrontational--- almost joking way--- like I didn't reallycare either way but was just wondering--- why he stopped calling, etc.   I saythat, but I have never done that before, so I don't really know if that iswhat I wish I would do, or if that really is what I would do--- and this hashappened to me lots of times.   Usually, I just write the guy off as gay orstupid...Leslie (and though I haven't talked to my mom, I know she would agree) saysnot to give him any satisfaction of knowing you care.   Just act pleasant andnormal as if nothing has happened and is if you were actually the one whostopped the contact--- maybe he thinks you were, you never know.   I thinkthis is a good tactic if you are sure your curiosity and need to tell himoff won't eat at you.Actually, in practice, I usually combine these tactics.   Remember whenMichael Stockton was so rude to me freshman year?   First I called him andtold him off (Laura made me), then I ignored him (pleasantly, though)forabout four months until he couldn't stand it and started asking Laura aboutme.In other words, both tactics are good.   I really think you ought to do whatmakes you feel the best.   If you confront him, he might say something youdon't want to hear, but then again, you will get some resolution.   If youdon't confront him, you can always chalk it up to his homosexuality and youcan feel better knowing he thinks you don't care...If I ever see him again, I will ignore him (blatantly).Don't worry about it too much--- we should feel sorry for people who arestill confused about their sexuality at 31.

Should it be determined that it is necessary to&lt;remove&lt;an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be notified&lt;and&lt;given an explanation.

I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough &amp; private enough) 2.   I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy. 3.   I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with 4.   I will NOT be a push-over Well, what do you think?   Any suggestions/recommendations?   I am very new to this whole relationship discussion thing.   More importantly, do you think there is ANYTHING he could say/do that would or should allow him a second chance?   Right now I don't know if there is, but unlike you (and you know this about me) I do believe in second chances.   That does not mean that a second chance is a given in this situation.   Get back to me when you get a chance.   Susan- - I just know I would always regret not meeting with him Em.   This is a chance for me to prove that I can handle myself with maturity and dignity even with my emotions on the line.   I think ultimately, regardless of the outcome, it will make me a stronger person.

      "body": "\nHey,Thanks for the well wishes.   I don't actually leave until Thursday, but I am VERY ready and equally excited.   I ended up meeting Ted for dinner Thursday to \"chat\".   He definitely doesn't deserve the title of Wonder Boy.   Anyway, I'll forward you the email I sent Emily regarding the evening in question.   Hope everything's good with you.Well, we met and had dinner last night.   NOTHING of importance was discussed during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were leaving that any actual talking occurred.   Here are the basics...- There is definitely no \"us\" anymore...and I quote \"sometimes these things just fade out\"- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still don't- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond   2 mos. in those three years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say issues?- He told me \"I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do with you, it's all me.\"   Of course I agreed with him saying \"I know it's you Ted, I don't have any problems.\" (He got a chuckle out of that one)- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of things in the beginning- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.   I'll talk to you soon.SusanBy the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and maybe just a little harsh)\n"

I'm sure the VPs will get tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away. Tonight is the big CAM gala.   Bill was in trial all week and had no time to go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).   Andre is a couple of inches shorter than Bill.   Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that Bill is my date.   My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.   It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and the rest is very heavy pink satin.   Since it wraps in the back I was able to move the hooks over to get it to fit.   Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get it hemmed!   Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.

I painted half of my bedroom lastnight, and the other half will have to wait until I decide what to do withthe windows.   But, I needed to paint over the patch on the fireplace wall,and the holes left by the blinds I took down ages ago.   Didn't know whatcolor I had used, so I chose a new one.   You can't really tell that I'vestopped at the corners.Jim is still unsure about his business trip rescheduled and rescheduled fornext week, the 4th and 5th.   I'm hoping it's canceled because Karin asked ifI would come, and that really puts me in a bind with Eric coming in on the6th as far as cooking, and last minute things.   Sally is coming on the 8th,so if the trip is postponed until that week, she'll be around.Are you still going to SA for your continuing ed?Did I tell you I bought 4 rocking chairs for the back porch?

DF   \tFrom:   Susan Scott   04/25/2000 10:05 AM To: Drew Fossum@ENRONcc:   Subject: contract issueDrew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS.   Our consulting agreement with IGS (which has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract \"identified by IGS\" and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement.   During the term of the agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.   IGS is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee.   While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup Expansion capacity.   Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.   So, while Mark can certainly claim he \"identified\" the deal, he was not alone in doing so. Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to Lorraine to verify facts).   Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money they will be happy.   We would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee.   However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.   The amount in dispute could be as much as $2000,000, depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value.If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to IGS, let me know.   I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal --- just in case they do decide to take us to court.\n"

The discount letter does not obligate TW to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.

This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.   The discount letter, on the other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a certain period of time (typically one month).   Steve Harris wants to be able to \"sell daily firm for a one-year period.\"   In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.   I see no problem with this, do you?   (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.)\n"

      "body": "\nAs to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some reading and here are my thoughts.The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL000-95-000, in which the Commission ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.   Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that \"any rate, charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or classification\" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract that should be in effect.   The Commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but \"fixed\" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable...In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its authority to do so would be much clearer.   The Natural Gas Act expressly authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable.   \"Just and reasonable\" has been interpreted in many different contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.   As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.   However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and unreasonable.   The California proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 2000-3000% increases in their electricity bills.   The prices for electricity in California were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state.   By contrast, TW's transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice.   It is far from being a consumer issue, and besides, the elections are over.   However, as you and I have already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.   We do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the same types of deals.   Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.

Unconscionability may be the thing I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to market dislocations---i.e., the Hurricane example.

However, if my memory serves me correctly, none of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as TW and Sempra or PG&amp;E.   Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains struck at arms length.

Stan has asked Mike Moran if TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under \"anti gouging\" statutes or common law.   You know, the laws that say you can't charge $1000 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of water during a drought.   I think we need to research two things:1.   are there any such laws applicable to our business?   (Cal. state law would probably be the best place to start)2.   could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?   I.e., if the CPUC whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMMBtu, as happened on Friday.   If that happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for transport, or so the logic goes.   I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo necessary).   Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s to be done.   Thanks df   \n"

      "body": "\nHi Mum!   If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would be fun.   I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about what they do.   Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of my long-range plan.   If not, I will have met some interesting people.If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on Monday morning.The week is going OK.   All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore muscles so this is my night off.   Am planning to do some more house chores so I do not end up with another weekend like the last.I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, but I'll let you know.Call if you get lonely! Love,SoozCamp2scott@aol.com on 06/222/2000 05:47:31 PMTo: Susan.Scott@enron.comcc:   Subject: homeHi, Sooz,Got home about 1 p.m. today and can already feel my mood sinking---not readyto get back into my solo mode.Enjoyed being with the little bugaroo---even with the diarrhea, she was in agood mood with the exception of an occasional sore bottom.   She smiles allthe time.   It does wear me out considerably when I have her all day longthough, and, especially this time, when I was tired from our trip and Eric'svisit.I must think about a trip to Houston.   Are you aware of the big Houston artday in the galleries on July 8th?   Just caught a glimpse of it when thumbingthrough the new SW Art Mag.   I'll track it down and give you the particulars. (You'll have to review your travel schedule with me again.)Hope you're having a good week.   love, Mum\n"

      "body": "\nThanks for the email.   Your candid comments make me wish I was over there right now sitting in a pub with you and Katy drinking a pint.   I am in full agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area in which 23 does not differ from 31...cowardess (As my Dad so eloquently put it, \"He's just chicken-shit\").   So, the plan of attack for the time being is none.   I am not going to do anything (that means no emails, no phone calls, no nothing).   Of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an entirely different state vs. two floors down from me, so next week will be the true test.   You will be happy to know, however, that I do have a good support system in Monique.   She is a firm advocate of the \"drop him and make him work should he happen to come crawling back\" school.   You know what really kills me though is the thought that, yet again, I will ultimately be disappointed by someone I truly expected more out of (I keep thinking about all the times I said \"I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.\" - well, it dropped) .   Anyway, I've have decided to throw myself into work, books, exercise, etc. in a effort to distract my mind from other things - it's kind of working.   I'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now.   You have to email me back with more details regarding the new pad, like will there be enough room for me to crash there when I come to visit (if not, I'm sure Nick would put me up - scarey).   Also, I sent Katy an email about coming to visit so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon.   FYI:   The Longhorns beat Louisiana Lafayette 52-10 last Saturday (the game was fun, but extremely HOT!!!), it was a real nail biter.   Talk to you soon,Sue*** Don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a shortcoming on my part.   I don't.   Rather, I am convinced he wasn't expecting the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that I was, he freaked.   I'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence that the last time we went out I let down one of the last walls I was holding up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting aloof. (Things that make you go hmm.)\n"

      "body": "\nHey Em,First things first, I got the personality test...very interesting.   I took it twice.   The first time I was a Mastermind (like Katy) and the second I was a Mentor (like Matt)   I think I only changed two answers between the first and second test.   Anyway, definitely a fun little intro to a rather boring Monday morning.I was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of Ted Noble.   I guess the last time I had emailed you Ted had to spend the night at Darren's apartment because he'd left his keys in his locker at the Met.   Well, if you'll remember at the end of the email he said he'd talk to me later, which is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could go get a drink that night or not.   I knew he had his presentation that day so I figured he'd call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah...I received no call, no email, no nothing.   Of course, always wanting to give others the benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to Austin and pick up his friend from the airport.   If that were the case, knowing Ted, I thought he must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call.   WRONG!!!   Friday at work I had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons I swear) and he was there, the jerk.   He didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with me at all that day.   Flash forward to the next week.   I didn't get back to the office until Wednesday because I was in Austin Tuesday for a recruiting trip.   When I got in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing.   I also didn't have any messages at any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.   So it's now Thursday afternoon, still no interaction...I am pissed.   About 2:000 p.m. he calls.   He asks me about San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips were great.   We discuss UCLA and UT football for   a while...I of course get riled up.   He informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron.   While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his vacation time.   He said that he and Darren had been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week had pretty much just been one long string of meetings.   It is around this point that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.   As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. \"I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.\"   I make sure I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and   1 whole week (7 days) AND at no point did he ask to get together before he left.   So, that was Thursday.   I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and, to my dismay, run in to him.   We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when he's leaving, he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.So here we are, or rather here I am in Houston...alone.   Any thoughts?On a brighter note, tell Katy I think I'm going to try and come Oct 4 - Oct 9 so that I can see both of you.   Also, I understand your dilemma regarding Claudia, but I definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the mouth (if you know what I mean).   That first month after Katy leaves is going to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a crutch until you find your footing.   I'm sure Monique can testify to a little extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off.   And speaking of Matt, no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat.   I need to shoot him an email and see how things are shaping up for him.   I'm willing to bet though that moving to Austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just transplanted to a prettier location.Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy.   Oh, and I'm going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk about swinging a rotation in London (he has 75 employees over there that work for him right now), and I'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure I'm doing everything I can to get over there and still get promoted.Talk to you soon,Susan*** Humor is the best medicine.***So I'm thinking of taking that t-shirt Ted gave me and writing this on the back of it...I dated Ted Noble and all I have to show for it is this lousy t-shirt.Dont'cha love it?\n"

I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with 4.   I will NOT be a push-over (it's not in my character anyway)Well, what do you think?   Any suggestions/recommendations?   I am very new to this whole relationship discussion thing.   Most importantly, do you think there is anything he could say/do that would or should allow him a second chance?   Right now I don't know if there is.SusanPS - I think I'm going to come over with Mom and Dad now in November.   I've been checking out airfare recently, ouch!

George's on the Cove, The Marine Room, Brockton Villa,\rTrattoria Acqua and Pacifica Del Mar.   All of these, with the exception of\rPacifica Del Mar, are in La Jolla so I suppose we'd have to take that into\rconsideration...There is a Presbyterian church in La Jolla that could be an\roption (but if your friends have suggestions I defer to their judgement\rboth religiously and gastronomically).

I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.   Allie's wedding is Dec. 16.   at Sundance.   If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I could hit the bunny slopes together.   I want to take lessons, and stick to the easy runs.   No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it is.Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.   I have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, and have told him so.   So I'm not sure what will happen.

What are you doing Sat, Sept 29?   Was just checking over theBroadway series at the Paramount, and \"Chorus Line\" is coming for a 2-wkperiod.   I would love to see it.   I could probably find someone to go with ona weeknight, but would prefer going with you if you're available.   Let meknow.   I'll be leaving for Calif a few days later, Oct 3.Eric had a fatty tumor removed from just under his shoulder Mon.   Called himwhen I returned from Houston to check on him and he surprised and shocked meby saying he was not skiing with his L.A. group this year, and wants me to goon some ski trips with him.   It's one of those things you wish for, and thenyou get it?   Oh no.   I don't even know if I'll really progress past thebeginner slope, but am sure I'll be very good at apres.   I think he'sconsidering Park City for the first one.   He says the transportation there isgood, and it's a good place for me to learn.Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues. and I discovered the Hip Abductors!Wow.   Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night.   Sure hope allthis is doing some good.   Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs, andThe Met isn't one of them, but that doesn't matter.   You can still go as aguest.   (Neither is the Los Gatos Ath. Club.)   Must check out exercises forskiing.Went to the lab early this a.m. for pre-physical tests.   Had a late lunchyesterday and no dinner, so I was starved when I woke up.   They opened at7:000 and there wasn't much of a wait.Fabion had disappeared for a few weeks, and Mike had lined up another guy tomow for us, but Fabion showed up---he had been in Mexico.   Sure glad to seehim.   He's from some town near San Miguel.K, J &amp; G are coming for an overnight Sat.   Karin has a haircut appt.   Gladfor the company.Mother's a/c went out in her car as she was leaving Austin on the 5th.   Allthat way to Houston in the heat.   At least she left early.   She just spent$8000 for a new compressor for that old heap.   Couldn't believe it.   She hadjust spent $2000 for freon on her previous trip---it all leaked out.   Even withher other gas guzzler, $1000 would have gone a long way paying for gas.Hope you're having a good week.   Did Bill make it home?   love, mum\n"

      "body": "\nFirst of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem with Deron moving in.   However, in return I would ask for increased rent of $650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use and wear &amp; tear.   After you read this let me know whether you think this is reasonable.I'll try to answer all your questions:Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted tomake sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse aswe would be removing light items for heavier items. A.   I really do not think it is a problem.   In addition to the oak floor, there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.   I'd draw the line at a waterbed, though!Q.   The stove is a bit problematic... A.   No problem to look into this.   I'm sure it can be repaired.   I will give the appliance folks a call.   Q.   Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? A.   I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.Q.   Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for sure?A.   I have a bad feeling about those connections!   I'll get them up and running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.Q.   I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? A.   I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more economical.   Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and towels dry than with electric!If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.Q.   At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?A.   I have always thought linoleum in a black &amp; white checkerboard pattern would look really cute in there.   It's cheap to install and fairly easy except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old stuff is going to be a you-know-what.   I will call &amp; ask my handyman, unless you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.Q.   Do you know if any paint is leftover?A.   The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be some left in the garage.   I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.The only additional issue I have is parking --- Dianna is staying with me and helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use that middle space.   I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to park on the street.   The other option is to get one of the back garage doors working so there is access to the garage from the alley.   If I did this do you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get everything done then if that's okay with y'all.Call if you have further questions!\n"

Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.   Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after maternity leave.   I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for everyone.   Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!   Most everyone I know is raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.   Even the handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several days a week, for sanity's sake.Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.   I get the impression that she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in for spontaneous visits, so that's good.   I always enjoy meeting her for lunch---for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.   Thank God she can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.   Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called \"Fucking A.\"   It was a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.   I thought it would be funnier but it was actually pretty dark.   The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.   Despite the subject matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.   Diverse Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.   (Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)   They mostly sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.   A lot of it is really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.   One of my friends at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been hanging out there to see whether I like the people.   Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.Time to read more FERC cases.   I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the drum all day.Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!Love,Susan\n"

      "body": "\nHey K!   Thanks for the note.   Everyone is asking how you're doing.   Sorry to hear about your back; I know what it is like.   As much as you are inclined to run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my back problem was just to recline as much as possible!   My house truly became a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.   I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:   Kyle and Quinn.   For some reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.   Perhaps because it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.   I think you really have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.   Who knows, she might turn out to be more of a Gladys!   heh, heh!The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.   It looks really good.   I even have a little palm tree --- required for the Heights.   The last thing is to finish the driveway --- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel sitting in the back yard!Time to work.Try to take it easy!

I am alsotardy on my xmas thankyou notes so I'm hoping a computer one will sufficefor you! What would Miss Manners say? Needless to say we love all the stuffyou gave us. I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make. No moresawing!   Jim has worn his new shirt many times and loves the book. I toothought it was a good Christmas, despite the pre-Christmas funk many of uswent through! It all turned out ok - even our time with Yvette wasn't sobad!Things are moving along in baby world. P-nut is moving downwards,alleviating the pain in my ribs, but now causing sciatica (sp?)   in my righthip and leg. I feel creaky and it hurts to walk. Not cool - I have too manythings left to do around the house to have to stay off my feet. Oh well. isuppose it will all get done. We are still searching for the right name andnow need some input since we can't seem to make a decision between us. Hereare our latest choices in no particular order - Grayson, Kyle, Quinn,Kendall, Lindsey, and Hayley (may be too popular). My favorite combinationis Grayson Scott Shelton. Jim likes Kyle Elizabeth Shelton or Kyle Alison.Yes, we know Kyle is usually a boy's name, but we had a female intern at JRAone summer named Kyle and I thought it was cool. One of my baby name bookshas both Kyle and Quinn on the \"truly unisex names\" list. Any comments ornew suggestions are appreciated!Must get going on work. Hope to hear from you soon.Karin\n"

Thanks for the new clothes; I still can't believe we let you shop for us on Mother's Day weekend!   Got a message that Lois came by and got the dishes.   Earlier when I was in a meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 610.   Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by.Had another sleepless night Sun. and finally took some Unisom and had a good night's sleep last night.   What a relief.   I have really never had this problem before.   It's good to have a lot of energy, but you have to shut down sometime.Am sending you my travel schedule for next week.   The following week (May 29 - June 2) I'm planning to be in SF also, but I'm not sure I'll actually have to be there that long.Have a good afternoon!Love,SoozCamp2scott@aol.com on 05/15/2000 12:30:28 PMTo: Susan.Scott@enron.comcc:   Subject: weekendHi, Sooz!   Hope you had a good trip back home yesterday.   I really do wishHouston were at least an hour closer.Thank you for the beautiful pjs and robe and for the Sunday brunch.   I wishKarin had been more help to you, but then, she never has been.   I reallyappreciate all your work.Good cartoon on the editorial page this a.m.:   Putin, the new Russianpresident, was seated at his desk when an aide comes in and says, \" George W.Bush wants to know if you're related to Ras Putin.\"Darrell and I went on an early morning walk and neither of us felt very welland doubled back before reaching the bridge.   I think I was all tuckered outfrom our Sun. walk.The 3 of us were trying to get together for Darrell's birthday lunch, so I'mgoing to make lunch here on Sat.   Cathy is coming into town for a haircut andK&amp;J&amp;G will be here since Karin has an appt. as well.   We usually go out tolunch, but I don't want to miss any baby time!I'm cleaning up the house from the weekend today.   Hope you have a good week. love, mum\n"

Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool in the afternoon and I did some shopping.   Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon and did part of the Bright Angel trail.   That was pretty strenuous but definitely worth it.   Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had Bill's trial schedule to deal with.   I'll spare you the details of my trip home --- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon yesterday and have a $2000 travel voucher for my trouble.I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in until later on Saturday.   How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on Sunday a.m.?Have to run to a meeting ... for race info, I would try a search for Texaco or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.   I know that Texaco probably has it on their website.   If you don't find anything let me know.Love,SoozCamp2scott@aol.com on 05/09/2000 01:37:42 PMTo: Susan.Scott@enron.comcc:   Subject: your tripHi, Sooz!Hope you had a wonderful time in Ariz, saw all kinds of wonderful things, anddidn't fall into the Canyon and expire.   Hope you took a lot of photos.Can't wait to hear all about it.I had a good time with Grayson.   Jim and I fed her bottles Sat and Sun, andshe took them without a whimper.   Karin is feeling liberated!   I think shewants to quit breastfeeding since she is having to pump at the office, andeverytime Grayson misses a feeding from her.   Jim is upset.   She has an allyin Eric.   He says, men don't know when to stay out of something like that.Anyway, Grayson is turning out to be a very happy baby.   Everytime you lookat her, she breaks out in a huge smile.Are you coming next weekend?   K&amp;J are and have made a couple of hc appts.One is for 6:45 Fri which they fear they won't be able to make.Trying to get some enthusiasm to pull out all the dead ground cover and plantsomething else, but so far, can't seem to get the momentum.   Everything elseis looking pretty good with all our rains.   Except that the shrub peopleraped the photinias by the street.   They say they should come back nicely.We'll see.Is there someplace you can find info about the car races in Sept?   Eric has afree ticket he needs to use by Nov 15.   I don't know how this would work withour CA trip planned for Oct. 3-17.   Had no problem getting a place to stay inCarmel and we're working out from there.

      "body": "\nMaria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...The problem:As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: \"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate,\" and the additional frustrating language \"[a]ll available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . ...\"   At our last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate to index prices.   However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.   I have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.   However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.Why the problem exists (you may already know):Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place.   In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates.   \"[T]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.   Thus, the recourse rate mitigates market power.\"   The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly not limited to ROFR situations:   when capacity is constrained, a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.   \"When there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff.\"   The example cited by the Commission:   If a pipeline has 1000 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery).   When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added the statement that \"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate.\"   Presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority.   Solutions???I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question.   I feel as if I've really been chasing my tail here.   I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.   But I keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).   Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.   I think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this.   Do you agree?   Stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition.   Might be worth it to us, though.Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate.   After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.   We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.   However, despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency.   We wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.   But I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that recourse rates be available.   That requirement has not changed.   Have either of you seen anything to the contrary?   I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to discuss briefly with you first.   Please call me so we can talk for a few minutes.   Thanks. \n"

Obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.   He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.   Also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence.   That could be good, or it could be bad.

He is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to FERC jurisdiction.   I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many years been a shipper on TW.   Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail anyway!Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have title to the gas they ship.   At this point Lorraine and I believe they might just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.   If anything interesting happens I'll let you know.\n"

The parties have been ordered to appear and show cause at a hearing (to be scheduled by the assigned ALJ) demonstrating that: - SDG&amp;E has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 2000/20001 winter heating season, as well as the longer term throughout the year.   If such supply is not adequate, SDG&amp;E shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate supply. - SDG&amp;E's gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need for gas-fired electric generation.   If not, SDG&amp;E shall submit plans for obtaining adequate supply. - SDG&amp;E's   gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by interests of its corporate affiliates. - Recently added demands on SDG&amp;E's capacity are not negatively impacting supply for SDG&amp;E's customers, and are otherwise consistent with representations to the Commission. - SDG&amp;E's current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable; if not, SDG&amp;E shall propose changes. A written response from the three parties on these issues is due on November 222.   Other parties may file comments on the response within 10 days after the response is filed. The Commission also ordered SDG&amp;E to evaluate whether an interim, interruptible program, which will provide cost incentives to those customers voluntarily electing interruptible service, is needed this winter.   If so, SDG&amp;E must submit a proposal for expedited Commission consideration. The OII represents the Commission's response to an Advice Letter filed by SDG&amp;E requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric generation customers.   The Advice Letter was heavily protested and was withdrawn by SDG&amp;E. In my conversation with Mark Baldwin regarding our pending consulting agreement for monitoring California regulatory matters for Transwestern, I asked him to watch for Sempra's Nov. 222 filing and to advise whether he believes Transwestern should file comments or appear at the hearing that is to be scheduled.   I will follow up with Mark, and provide you with a copy of the filing.\n"

However, please do so with the caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal advice to Sempra from ET&amp;S's legal department, and the content of this pleading should ultimately be up to Sempra's legal/regulatory staff.Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up.\n"

I think that essentially all the terms of the   settlement in principle are now covered in it.?In   addition to adding material, we have made some changes in language in the last   version.? Even these changes may not incorporate all comments I have   received from SoCalGas/SDG&amp;E management.? We have NOT made an attempt   to respond to all comments received to date in this version.? If no change   has been made on an issue you commented on, that does not necessarily mean we   agree or disagree with your comment.? ?Especially for the new material, there has not yet been final review by   SoCalGas and SDG&amp;E management either.?Hopefully I have been able to correct a problem with the last electronic   version that cause a lot of the section numbering to go haywire when it was   emailed and then opened and printed, even though it looked fine on my computer   and printed fine from my computer.? Lots of sections mysteriously would   renumber themselves as \"6.4\"?I am   also attaching the latest draft of an appendix to be included with the full   settlement that is a revised version of the \"Primary and Secondary Receipt   Point Access Rights\" document that was attached with the Deal Points in the   April 3 filing.?We'll   try to send along some of the other appendices soon.? ?---   Glen SullivanSempra   Energy Law Dept.; gsullivan@sempra.com.? tel: (619)   6999-5162;? fax: (619) 6999-5027??? - GIR413N.rtf - Primary Rights 4-12 .doc\n"

If he will not agree to do this, then I would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time.

      "body": "\nAs you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 4000,000 MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California at a higher rate.   SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.   In part, they are alleging that TW is \"attempting to exploit a weakness\" in the GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.   For example, under TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump alt. firm in cycle 2.   SoCal says this means that any primary shipper attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate to its primary point once this \"alternate\" capacity [I assume they mean USGT's] is confirmed.   According to SoCal this will substantially limit shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.   Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under which it moves.   Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT will bump firm shippers.I could really use your help in responding to this argument.   (First of all, I'm not sure I even understand it!)   If either of you have a few minutes today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.   Also --- you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone else in your group if you are swamped.   Please e-mail or call when you get a chance...Thanks!Susan (x30596)\n"

While he was standing in&lt; front of the gorilla's enclosure, the wind gusted and he got&lt; some grit in his eye.&lt;&lt; As he pulled his eyelid down to dislodge the particle, the&lt; gorilla went crazy, bent open the bars, and beat the guy&lt; senseless.&lt;&lt; When the guy came to, the zookeeper was anxiously bending over&lt; him, and as soon as he was able to talk, he explained what had&lt; happened.&lt;&lt; The zookeeper nodded and explained that in 'gorilla language',&lt; pulling down your eyelid means \"Fuck you\".&lt;&lt; This didn't make the gorilla's victim feel any better and he&lt; vowed revenge.&lt;&lt; The next day he purchased two large knives, two party hats, two&lt; party horns, and a large sausage. Putting the sausage in his&lt; pants, he hurried to the zoo and over to the gorilla's cage,&lt; into which he tossed a hat, a knife, and a party horn.&lt;&lt; Knowing that the big apes were natural mimics, he put on a&lt; party hat. The gorilla looked at him, looked at the hat, and&lt; put it on.&lt;&lt; Next he picked up his horn and blew on it. The gorilla picked&lt; up his horn and did the same.&lt;&lt; Then the man picked up his knife, whipped the sausage out of&lt; his pants, and sliced it neatly in two.&lt;&lt; The gorilla looked at the knife in his cage, looked down at&lt; his own penis, and he...&lt;&lt;&lt; scroll down&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   ...pulled down his eyelid.&lt;&lt;&lt; ***&lt; More of those Rejected Hallmark Cards:&lt;&lt; 1.

Too bad no one likes your wife.&lt;&lt; 3. How could two people as beautiful as you have such an ugly baby?&lt;&lt; 4. I've always wanted to have someone to hold, someone to love. After&lt; having&lt; met you, I've changed my mind.&lt;&lt; 5. I must admit, you brought Religion in my life. I never believed in Hell&lt; 'til I met you.&lt;&lt; 6. As the days go by, everyday I think of how lucky I am that you're not&lt; here to ruin it for me.&lt;&lt; 7. If I get only one thing for Christmas, I hope it's your sister.&lt;&lt; 8. As you grow older, Mom, I think of all the gifts you've given me. Like&lt; the need for therapy...&lt;&lt; 9. Thanks for being a part of my life!!! I never knew what evil was before&lt; this!&lt;&lt; 10. Congratulations on your promotion. Before you go, would you like to&lt; take&lt; this knife out of my back?   Youll probably need it again.&lt;&lt; 111. Someday I hope to get married, but not to you.&lt;&lt; 12. Happy Birthday! You look great for your age...Almost Lifelike!&lt;&lt; 13. When we were together, you always said you'd die for me. Now that&lt; we've&lt; broken up, I think its time you kept your promise.&lt;&lt; 14. I knew the day would come when you would leave me for my best friend.&lt; So here's his leash, water bowl and chews.&lt;&lt; 15.

You are such a good friend that if we were on a sinking ship and there&lt; was only one life jacket... I'd miss you heaps and think of you often.&lt;&lt; 19.

Several   minor \"sentence structure\" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been included.   Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596).   The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter:1.   Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.   This paragraph is not necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts.2.   Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper.Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area.   The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.0005/Dth/d for the term of the agreement.   Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.   Southwest Gas may also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.\n"

(The lady at the spa recommended the second one)Fruit Body Facial: A double-exfoliating facial for the entire body leaving the skin feeling silky smooth and shining --- ideal before a wedding or a special occasion that's just right for that backless dress. You are first exfoliated with crushed Californian grape seeds followed by a light misting with an orange blossom aromatherapy oil. After a brief shower, you'll enjoy an all-over message with a facial quality message lotion. Then it's your choice of either an invigorating peppermint glycolic or a calming aloe vera/grapefruit finishing skin treatment.Benefits: Skin feels rejuvenated and healthy; circulation is stimulated and the skin has a healthy glow.Time: 90 minutesPacific Paradise Body Scrub&amp; Massage: Pineapple papaya lotion is the moisturizer and California grape seeds - nature's anti-oxidant - are the exfoliant in this 20 - 25 minute body scrub.

We are working with Agave to develop a storage facility near the West Tx lateral in Eddy County, NM.   My original thought was both parties would share in the development costs and own equity interests in the facility.   TW would then lease out storage space to shippers plus use storage capacity to augment our Park N Ride capability.   The storage would be connected via lateral to our W Tx line.But then it occurred to me how do we share ownership between regulated and non-regulated entities?Do you have some time Friday morning to talk about this?   thanksKevinx35559\n"

My theory, which is based on our experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with the joint ownership --- and not try to assert jurisdiction over Agave (a gathering company).   Although it seems likely that other pipelines have entered into such arrangements, I've not found any cases on point here.Do you agree with my conclusion?   Any other ideas or insights?   Please let me know.   Thanks.---"

Bill Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present. 1.   The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale. 2.   Price:   the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be determined, and how capacity will be awarded.   We might also need to include an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year. 3.   Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a shipper exercises its call option. 4.   Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy altogether. 5.   May need to address:   assignability of options; limitation on damages for nonperformance. 6.   Timeline:   - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)   - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service   - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)   - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require Board approval at Enron)   - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)   - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)If you have any further comments please let me know.   I am going to try to get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.\n"

I'm OK with eliminating \"stockholders\" and the \"...judgments of any nature...\" clause you two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs a. and b.Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement.   TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT standards.   Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in case of explosion, etc.   In other words, both parties bear the risk attached to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and DOT standards.(By the way, I believe the \"notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the contrary\" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.)Any questions --- please e-mail or call (713-853-0596).\n"

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nI have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks ago.   One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called (for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.   If a Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest could be scheduled IT.   Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me.   As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.   Similarly, if TW were to notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this ---   a Limited Day is defined as a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of gas is transported.   Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).   If so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what you think.SS\n"

      "body": "\nYesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.   Overall the meeting was very positive.   We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the marketing representatives.   However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed Ross) had a couple of issues.   The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate concern.   Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.   They have run into situations in which pipelines (examples:   Koch, El Paso) have blatantly favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do deals with them.   (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's price option deals with its affiliate.)   The perception is that the affiliates, by using \"funny money,\" can always make themselves the highest bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + affiliate).   The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.   The presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.   Dynegy's proposal would encourage affiliates to pay \"real\" dollars.   While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation on options transactions with marketing affiliates.   It is likely that other pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the precedent set by our filing.   Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with affiliates.   Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and our reactions were the same.   Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to do business with TW.   We can probably expect an intervention with comments or a limited protest addressing the issue.The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal as a negotiated rate.   My analysis of this issue is that since we're proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.   If you think this is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it before we file the tariff sheets.   Sarah's question seemed to be more one of curiosity rather than a basis for protest.Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer meeting to discuss the service.   Jeff and the rest of the commercial group are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting. If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.\n"

      "subject": "TW Options update",
      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nTranswestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.   After a brief overview of the proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.   Here is a summary of the comments.Marketing affiliate concerns.   BP's regulatory representative expressed concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.   In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA could purchase an \"out of the money\" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.   Proceeds from ENA's ability to then \"move the market\" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.   BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 1000% of the option proceeds to other shippers.   Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service.   Since TW will be the first pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as possible.   Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.   TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.   If BP and others have serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines.Right of first refusal.   Burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.   TW's   response was that ROFR will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.Negotiated rate.   BP's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.   TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.   However, TW's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.   Hoarding capacity.   Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.   It was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.   Perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.   TW acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.   Although TW did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require TW to do so in a final order.Our plan is to meet with PG&amp;E and SoCalGas in California the week of September 111 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.\n"

Left a message for my friend at DMP but he (like everyone else)is out 'til next year.   But since there were no subsequent orders issued in the docket I assume there were no problems with the filing.I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file as nego. rate approach.If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I will draft something and send it your way.* * *The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service under DMP's Rate ScheduleFTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement specifies that KGS will paya volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible transportation service rate asset forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as KGS' maximum daily reservation quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 999 and &amp;copy; identifies five primary delivery points for KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP999-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to the above negotiated rate so that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm rate schedule.\n"

      "body": "\nIn response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here is my 2 cents' worth.The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me). See Section 13.A. (Sheet No. 18):   \"All available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm transportation queue.\"   The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid deadline --- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.   Even if the one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit bids (Tony --- am I right about this?).The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).   TW will continue to comply with all provisions in this section.   The section even specifically provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically.I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an online open season one way or the other.   I believe our tariff gives us the flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do.Hope this helps.   If you want to discuss this I'll be here most of the day, and I will be reachable by e-mail while I'm in San Francisco next week.   My hearing does not start 'til noon Houston time on Tuesday, so if we need to talk Tuesday morning you can reach me at my hotel (415.398.1234).\n"

Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of Transwestern Pipeline   and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation capacity to the   southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for the California   Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest today. Between   the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm capacity from the   San Juan and Permian basins to California.   For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity represents a   worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and Trade, who has   held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. \"At least then   there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now it's Enron, the   owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes.\"   But \"what's even worse,\" he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision in the contracts. It   stipulates that \"after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, it has to share the   proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So effectively, Enron and   El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the transportation rate   differential between the California border and the Southwest producing basins.\"   The two pipeline companies \"that have for decades competed with each other in carrying   Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's anticompetitive, and   there's no way FERC should approve it,\" Morris said. He recalled the basis differential   between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up by 17% during   19998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity into California.   This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes.   \"At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain the same   anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts,\" Indicated Shippers noted, but   a \"closer review and analysis\" reveals the anticompetitive effects of the revenue-sharing   provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts \"are not only similar\" to those of the hotly   contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy case, \"but are   increased...due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing affiliate of El Paso's   primary interstate pipeline competitor,\" Transwestern.   Both the RRM and RSP \"operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and its competitors   to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act to drive down the   basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity,\" Indicated Shippers told   FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes producers   Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and Phillips   Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas Marketing.   FERC \"should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred in allowing the   El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after finding that the   contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court of Appeals].   That same error should not be repeated here,\" the producers and marketers said.   The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is a little bit   unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following Dynegy. \"When the   Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. We thought   FERC did a very inadequate job then...This time around we're asking for FERC to   summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a strong stand right at   the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering under the Dynegy   situation. And this is even worse.\"   In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC has asked that   an \"anti-hoarding condition\" be included in the contracts, which would require Enron to   release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher than what it's paying   El Paso for the capacity. \"They must make a little profit,\" Morris noted. \"We're confident   Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity...so there's going to be unused   capacity.\"   The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point for the Block II   portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&amp;E-Topock in keeping with the terms of the   19996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed fully with   Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), which accused   El Paso of violating the 19996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use SoCalGas-Topock as   a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They contend the alleged   violation is included in the Enron contracts.   He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back Block II capacity   after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific Gas and Electric   (PG&amp;E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy the right to   do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the decision violates the   19996 settlement under which PG&amp;E paid $54 million to preserve the right of the pipeline's   shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its service territory.   The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would enable Enron   to \"just sit on the capacity,\" thereby withholding idle Block II capacity from the market.   Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II capacity   provisions of the 19996 rate case, as well as \"exacerbate\" the primary firm delivery point   capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now.   The CPUC accused El Paso of \"deliberately\" filing the Enron contracts at FERC just   before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline \"is trying to sneak one of the most   controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that protests would be   minimized,\" said Morris. \"They did this with the Dynegy contracts two years ago. They   have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for people to protest and   harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect.\" ,Copyright 1999 Intelligence Press Inc.

We discuss UCLA and UT football for   a while...I of course get riled up.   He informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron.   While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his vacation time.   He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week had pretty much just been one long meeting.   It is around this time that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.   As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. \"I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.\"   I make sure I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and   1 whole week (7 days) AND at no point does he ask to get together before he leaves.   So, that was Thursday.   I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and, to my dismay, run in to him.   We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when he's leaving (5:000 p.m.), he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.Anyway, I was not able to get him out for a drink to find out what's going on and now I just have to wait.

Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm right.   With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.   My condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie co-workers through this trying time.Susan(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are an \"Ag\" man now.)\n"

On Saturday we could get up, work out, grab something for brunch/lunch and maybe even go to Barton Springs (depending on the weather) and then I could take off and leave you the rest of Saturday and all of Sunday to work (we could even skip the Barton Springs piece).The other option is to just shift everything a day forward...I'd come up on Saturday and leave Sunday.Either give me a call or email me if either of these sound good to you.   I will also completely understand if you just really need to work/study this weekend.SuePS - I'm dying for someone to chat with about Vegas...can't really talk to my roommate since it was work related.\n"

Is there anything special you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).   I talked to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.   If you want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.   Also, do you have any predictions for the weather.   I'm planning on bringing the following - jeans, sweatshirt, black pants &amp; skirt, black cardigan, \"rain coat\" (I put it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some \"go out\" close, running shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.   I always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.   I'm assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home. I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.   I also emailed Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend. I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have much of a problem getting to your place.   I assume I'm going to want to get off at the Holland Park tube stop.   Should be a piece of cake, right?Any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me Friday morning?   I guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat (i.e. under the doormat or over the door frame?).   See you soon,Susan- I may have to pump Darren for a little bit of info Friday night (subtly of course)...Like did he know that I didn't know about Ted's \"past\" - maybe you can find out why the marriage ended.\n"

While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a separate option fee.   If this theory is not clear to you after you read the filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.   In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.   This structure has two advantages:   1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to discuss the following topics:1)   Your comments and questions on this draft,2)   Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from a logistical standpoint,3)   The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and4)   Comments received from shippers thus far.I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting time.I will be out Mon. and Tues.\n"

I realize there is some concern about showing them our filing.   What if we just show them our final tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss their questions?

I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything &amp; doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).   Since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, I think I would recommend we omit it.   However, NMNG might insist on this or similar language to reflect the \"deal\" --- or at least the conversations of the parties.   If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.

After the last week and a half of work I am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of shopping).   As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.   My guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I say we just get going.   The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.   I would definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some other things.   The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good seafood.   Anyway,   I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about 9:000 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days to work with. Love,Susan--- Also, if you could give me an idea of what kind of items I need to pack depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross overpacking...Thanks.\n"

In my revisions, I've attempted to reflect the least cost billing you described to me, using terminology I read in the tariff.   Please let me know if it looks alright to you.   I'm available to discuss this whenever you are, then I will make sending this to Mike top priority.   My sincerest apologies for the delay; there has been more chaos around here than I am accustomed to handling, and I appreciate your patience.Susanx30596\n"

See Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.   If TW does not give such notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract automatically rolls over for another year.   If this is not acceptable please let me know.---"

The chosen path was cool, indifference.   So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a really good showing.   I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:000.   About 8:000 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of someone.   Can you believe it?   He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.   Anyway, Kevin saw me and came over to chat.   He informed me that \"our friend Ted should be there shortly\" to which I responded, \"You would know better than me at this point\".   The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.   He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.   I said there really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 weeks.   Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head and cause a big scene.   When I said no, I think he was genuinely disappointed.   I said in order for me to do something like that I would have to care about the \"loss\" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have cared a bit more, with each passing day the \"loss\" seems less and less like much of a loss.   Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.   To go even further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date Ted nor any of his \"girl-friends\".   He said that while he thought Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't good dating material.   I agreed with Kevin saying \"Ted is a great guy, he just makes a lousy man\" (don't you like that one?).   I then went on to say \"Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?\".   Kevin: \"Much bigger and much better.\"   About this time my parents showed up...the plot thickens.   I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.   The two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when \"dum-da-dum-dum\" Ted shows up.   He approaches our group because he sees Kevin and is forced to make eye-contact with me.   I give him a \"hey\" and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant \"how's it going?\".   He asked what Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.   He never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening.   The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with \"my group\" for quite a while before going to join Ted.   My parents and I ate our steaks right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished.   It really was a great night.   I would almost say I was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).   So, when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to say good-bye to Kevin.   It was awesome.   Ted's sitting right next to Kevin while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair.   Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even make eye-contact.   I ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.   Needless to say I was very hung over today.   Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter ass-hole.   So I'm done.   And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces.   Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.   I bought my ticket today ( I think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - $450 before taxes).   I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:000 a.m. Friday the 6th and depart about 111:000 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.   I'm very excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.   I leave the activities in your capable hands.   ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren and Nick at some point).\"Single again\" Sue\n"

Rudy mentioned that in effort to get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him by consumingso much of his time requesting reports.   My understanding is that your typical response to this is \"I am the most altruistic person.\"   I am sure you recognize the hypocrisy laden in this statement.   If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not care if his acts are recognized or not.   In fact, the true altruist hopes only that his acts benefitthose to which they are directed.   We may have to downgrade you to \"concerned individual\".   But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. Smith Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:000 a.m.   If you haven't seen the film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic, extremely unselfishyoung man who takes on the corrupt political machines of Washington, D.C.   The film ranked 29th on AFI's (The American Film Institute) top 1000 films of the Century list,and is tied for first place on the Sscott5 Greatest Films List...FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.   I will make sure you both receive my next brilliant composition.   I must say I was tempted to remove you given your complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of appearances.\n"

I hope all is well and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.   We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against Louisiana Lafayette).   Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the 1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).   Simms started the game but only played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put some points on the board.   Simms did come back in the second half and through a touch-down pass.   The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys in the near future.Write back soon,Susan*** Humor is the best medicine.***So I'm thinking of taking the T-shirt Ted gave me from Beaver Creek and writing this on the back of it...I dated Ted Noble and all I have to show for it is this lousy T-shirt.Dont'cha love it?\n"

Then we are frustrated that the kids aren't old&lt;enough&lt;and we'll be more content when they are.   After that, we're frustrated&lt;that&lt;we have teenagers to deal with.   We will certainly be happy when they are&lt;out of that stage.   We tell ourselves that our life will be complete when&lt;our spouse gets his or her act together, when we get a nicer car, are&lt;able&lt;to go on a nice vacation, when we retire.&lt;&lt;The truth is, there's no better time to be happy than right now.   If not&lt;now, when? Your life will always be filled with challenges.   It's best to&lt;admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway.   One of my favorite&lt;quotes comes from Alfred D. Souza.   He said, \"For a long time it had&lt;seemed&lt;to me that life was about to begin - real life. But there was always some&lt;obstacle in the way, something to be gotten through first, some&lt;unfinished&lt;business, time still to be served, or a debt to be paid.   Then life would&lt;begin.   At last it dawned on me that these obstacles WERE my \"life.\"&lt;&lt;This perspective has helped me to see that there is no way to happiness.&lt;Happiness is the way.   So, treasure every moment that you have and&lt;treasure&lt;it more because you shared it with someone special, special enough to&lt;spend&lt;your time with...and remember that time waits for no one.&lt;&lt;So, stop waiting until you finish school, until you go back to school,&lt;until&lt;you lose ten pounds, until you gain ten pounds, until you have kids,&lt;until&lt;your kids leave the house, until you start work, until you retire, until&lt;you&lt;get married, until Friday night, until Sunday morning, until you get a&lt;new&lt;car or home, until your car or home is paid off, until Spring, until&lt;Summe&lt;until Fall, until Winter, until you are off welfare, until the first or&lt;fifteenth,&lt;until your song comes on to decide that there is no better time than&lt;right&lt;now to be happy.   Happiness is a journey, not a destination.&lt;&lt;(author unknown)&lt;&lt;&lt;___&lt;To unsubscribe, write to Temple_List-unsubscribe@listbot.com&lt;Start Your Own FREE Email List at http:///www.listbot.com/links/joinlb___Get Your Private, Free Email at http:///www.hotmail.com\n"

Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat foryou.   We had a good time on Saturday.   It is always fun to be on sixthstreet close to halloween, even more freaks come out.OK enough stalling.   I just thought something needed to be said aboutwednesday.   We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probablynever see or talk to one another ever again.   I don't like that solution.My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes missout on opportunities.   So the traditional me would say it was just one nightand didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.   One thingthat I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't beintimidated.   You have a very strong personality and I can see wheresomebody could easily be intimidated.   Along with that comes someone who issmart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whetheryour at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.   The one thing I know aboutyou is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary waybecause I know that isn't high on the priority list.   I also know that if Iwould have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting herewriting this email.When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be thathard.   I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed achange.   Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respectyou sometimes get it is understandable.   The thing I'm going to miss themost are all the friendships I have built working in that group.   Sometimesthe toughest times are when you really get to know someone.   But the hardestthing now is that I will not be around you.   I know that sounds really badbut the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting nextto each other.   We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easierknowing you were there.   I really think the best times I had in Houston werethose couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.   I alsoknew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing toget involved.   I really regret that decision right about now.Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know thatI'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to sharethis info.   I do think some things need to be said or else the other personwill never know.   You are a great person and even though the chips arestacked against me I needed to let you know this.   I understand that yourunder a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.   Theone thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and stillooking then you need not look any further.So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talkto you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less knowwhere to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to GrueneHall then let me know.   I also don't want to be put in one of your stalkercategories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me asthe next SP.Take care and have a good week.KyleBy the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, atleast it is number one in my book.___Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http:///www.hotmail.com.Share information about yourself, create your own public profile athttp:///profiles.msn.com.\n"

Here are the basics...- There is definitely no \"us\" anymore...and I quote \"sometimes these things just fade out\"- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still don't- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond   2 mos. in those three years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say issues?- He told me \"I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do with you, it's all me.\"   Of course I agreed with him saying \"I know it's you Ted, I don't have any problems.\" (He got a chuckle out of that one)- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of things in the beginning- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.   I'll talk to you soon.SusanBy the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and maybe just a little harsh)\n"

Hey Shorty,I am glad to hear that today is going a little better.   We are getting a tad busy.   I hope the beers were good last night, and I thought about a couple of cold ones as Darren and I were getting finished around 1:30 this morning.   A drink sounds good but I may be leaving for Austin tomorrow night after work to pick up my friend Mark at the Austin airport (I'll find out later tonight) and if that is the case then we'll get one next week.

I'll talk to you later when I get a better sense of what is going on.Ted&lt; &lt;A little girl was playing in the garden when she spotted two spiders&lt;mating.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Daddy, what are those two spiders doing?\" she asked.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"They're mating,\" her father replied.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"What do you call the spider on top, Daddy?\" she asked.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"That's a daddy longlegs.\" her father answered.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"So, the other one is a mommy longlegs?\" the little girl asked.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; \"No,\" her father replied. \"Both of them are daddy longlegs.\"&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; The little girl thought for a moment, then took her foot and stamped&lt;them&lt; &lt;flat.&lt; &lt; \"Well, we're not having THAT sort of shit in our garden.\"&lt; &lt;&lt;Susan M Scott08/30/2000 01:37 PMTo: Ted Noble/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: I'm such a rule breaker...Hey Pavarotti,Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big presentation tomorrow.   My day is going significantly better than yesterday so I am pleased.   Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.   By the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always get the two confused).Now for the rule-breaking.   I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I hope you can forgive my rudeness).   Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.Shorty- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.   Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.\n"

So, I stay at Darren and sleep on his couch.   Well, I try to sleep but his fire alarm keeps beeping ever 1-2 minutes and is really annoying.   So, being a guy, I take the alarm completely out of the wall with my leatherman tool.   Finally go to sleep and arrive in my same clothes and baseball hat at work around 7:30 to pick up my keys and head home and shower/change.   Of course this cannot go perfectly, so I run into my MD on the way to the Met parking lot. Smooth.   I finally arrive back at work around 9:000 and miss the group's morning weather briefing.

Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's approval; those above the threshold do. Does that make sense?

I spoke with TK and she is aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any contract that deviates from our standard language.

Our consulting agreement with IGS (which has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract \"identified by IGS\" and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement.   During the term of the agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.   IGS is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee.   While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup Expansion capacity.   Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.   So, while Mark can certainly claim he \"identified\" the deal, he was not alone in doing so. Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to Lorraine to verify facts).   Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money they will be happy.   We would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee.   However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.   The amount in dispute could be as much as $2000,000, depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value.If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to IGS, let me know.   I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal --- just in case they do decide to take us to court.\n"

The standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date.   Typically TW enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.   The marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.   The term of the FTS-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.   The discount is only applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.   If the FTS-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.   The basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.   We are not guaranteeing a shipper \"daily\" firm for longer than a one-day term.   The discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.Does this make sense?   I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.   Drew and I have discussed this and he is on board. Thanks.\n"

Steve Harris wants to be able to \"sell daily firm for a one-year period.\"   In contractual terms all this would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.   I see no problem with this, do you?   (Apparently the current perception in marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month period.)\n"

Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some repair/caulking/spackling.   Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably will not get to it until next month.   Maybe you will be able to help me decide on a color when you are here this weekend.   I'm torn between \"Happy Yellow\" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.   If I decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to the professionals.Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.   Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy dance, I invited him.   So that leaves us with one ticket.   If you would like to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around here will join us.Hope your weekend project was a success.   Talk to you soon!Love,S.\n"

For these reasons, the Commission will readily grant requests to   waive the 30 day notice requirement.\"I think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's OK to file on the same day.

Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect in recent years.   I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do.   The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 250,000 MMBtu.   ///Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up conversation with BR Thursday.   I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday and we hadn't heard from them yet.   They claim approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.   Michele and Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas.   I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.   They will not accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically \"best efforts\" and \"subject to operating conditions on TW\", so we will need to revise this further.We offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.   They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan - Waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 111/30/06).   The ball is in our court.   \n"

I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the following cast of characters:Steve HarrisKevin HyattLindy DonohoJeff FawcettTK LohmanChristine StokesMichelle LokayLorraine LindbergWhen I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone to x34516).   These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize meetings with, distribute things to, etc.   Their assistant is Audrey Robertson.   I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her (x35849).2.   Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.   I'm not picky about when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in early or stay late.   I think I asked Janet only twice.3.   Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot:- TW Options (a tariff filing)- Order 637 compliance- Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect)4.   Standing meetings:- TW Commercial Group staff meeting:   Monday at 9:30- Omaha regulatory staff meeting:   Tues. at 8:15.- Therapist:   every few weeks Thurs. 9:000 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!)5.   Faxes:   I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call first.   Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there).6.   Mail:   Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day.7.   Filing:   I generally avoid keeping files of useless information.   However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.   Filing is pretty important to me.   I promise to try to let you know what files are more important than others so you can prioritize.   The good news:   I rarely ever go to the extent where I would have you index a file.   Just putting things in the right folder is enough.8.   Computer files:   At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr000, 3rdqtr000, etc.)9.   Calendar:   Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the calendar. 10.   Friends you're likely to hear from a lot:   Ann, Bill, my grandmother (\"Ms. Savoy\"), Dianna111.   The Other Susan Scott:   There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.   I get her mail and phone calls all the time!   Her extension is 314445.   Not sure of her location as it seems to change a lot.I look forward very much to working with you!!!\n"

My previous drafts have provided for posting of Shipper call options only.   All other types of options will be generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.

The verb \"request\" may not be used without the word \"to.\"   Example:   \"Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion.\"4.   \"In regards to\" or \"vis-a-via\" sound more intelligent than \"about\" or \"concerning.\"5.   If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for emphasis.

Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.   Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as \"maintenance,\" I'm not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.   I am also not completely comfortable calling this \"force majeure\" because part of the tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either party; however, since the definition does include \"binding order of any court or governmental authority,\" we could possibly say this is force majeure if we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety rule.   (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure notice.)   If not, we can argue that since this is not \"maintenance,\" but simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction provisions.   In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under ordinary contract law.   I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed itself of the reservation charge reduction.   I recommend we give shippers reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate plans --- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions.\n"

Whenever you get a chance, letme know your arrival time on Saturday and departure on Monday so I can planaround them both...I've been brainstorming some fun things for us to do, and thought we couldspend some time lounging at the beach, shopping at the outlet center nearme, go out for a champagne bunch on Sunday, grill out on the beach, andpossibly go to a polo match or the Del Mar races.   Which of these interestsyou?   Are there any tourist sites that you would like to see while intown?   The zoo, Balboa Park (where all the museums are), or anythingelse?   Oh- I've arranged for us to have a massage on Monday- the woman iscoming to my house!   We'll each get a 30 minute massage...I think thiswill be great quality, girl time!   I've missed our shopping binges!Please bring any current pictures of friends and family- I can't wait tohear how everyone in your life is doing.   Weather has been beautiful asusual- about 75 degrees and perfect.   In the evenings it gets cool enoughto wear you need a light sweater or jacket, but you can always borrowsomething from me, too.The condo I'm living in now is tiny, but cute.   I've been living there fora year and am moving out in 2 weeks.   I could have moved out this Labor Dayweekend, but obviously didn't want to be doing that while you were intown.   So you'll have to excuse a bit of the mess and come back anothertime when I move into the cuter place- I love the new place I'm movinginto- it's 2 stories with vaulted ceilings and lots of skylights.See you soon!Julie\n"

      "body": "\nTony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some other basis.   It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.   However, I did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition.   As you may be aware, the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to its shippers.   NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.   The underlying presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting discriminatorily.   But of course the Commission never comes out and says this even though it should be obvious.Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. basis?).   Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to participate in the auction process.   Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the Enrononline process.Now for some trivia.   Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for determining best bid?   In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.   In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,3335, the Commission stated:   \"The Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology before the bidding process begins.\"   The only problem is I am not sure we have that \"flexibility\" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post a different method.   Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some language allowing us to do so.I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what you write I'd be happy to.\n"

It's all sort of loosey-goosey anyway because the judge has not announced the order in which witnesses will be presented.   I think she forgets some of us are from out of town!   Makes it really hard to plan.   I'll know for sure by the 25th.   Thank goodness for refundable airline tickets.   Anyway, are going to be around that 1st weekend of June?   And --- might you be available for dinner next Tuesday or Wednesday?   These guys like to talk business well into the evening hours, but my interest starts to wane near suppertime and I could probably make excuses and leave.Bill and I took a whirlwind trip to Arizona a couple of weekends ago.   He was in Bullhead City, of all places, where his uncle has a vacation home.   I joined him a few days later in Vegas.   Luckily he had been to Laughlin 2 nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system.   We set out for Sedona but first had to stop at Hoover Dam, then a diner in Kingman (on Route 666 of course).   Stayed a couple of nights in Sedona, where we climbed lots of rocks (which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas --- oops) and got real dusty and sunburned.   Then we drove up to the Grand Canyon and hung out at the South Rim.   Actually, we climbed down Bright Angel Trail &amp; back up, then drove straight to the Las Vegas airport, from which we took the redeye so Bill could make it to his trial the next day.   I would really love to spend more time in the Grand Canyon --- maybe not this fall, but the next.   Ciao fo' now, and lots of soulS.\n"

Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:   I believe his number is 713-2228-7401.   He's a nice guy and I believe him to be competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the best deal.
