      "body": "\nMark- here is my response to your request. Call with questions.Goal:Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.Performance:Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee Dec 111. The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to. Also, a template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes in the future. Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure prior to this activity. As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging activity resulting from this effort.Goal:Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.Performance:Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across EES. A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results presented to the Finance Committee. A RAC task force has been put in place which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit control systems where they need to be. Significant progress has been made against these recommendations. DSM projects have been spot tested with outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES. These tests have highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best employed.Goal:Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.Performance:Complete and Ongoing. During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to. A data base system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to. Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really understand where we have risks. It also helps in defining where we don't have responsibility such as EOTT,   Azurix   and The New Power Company.\n"

I answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 111 again soon. I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below outstanding. We will have to watch this issue carefully.Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem? Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough cash to operate.This feedback is just for fyi but it does indicate that board is active and not a rubber stamp.

As I mentioned in my voicemail to you, I was not aware of the farmout arrangement or JOA with Kelley and had not been asked to review the farmout agreement or the JOA.   I obtained copies of the documents and asked Steve to fill me in on how the situation developed.   Steve was out of the office much of last week; he followed up Friday with the attached email message. As Steve mentions in his email, there were extenuating circumstances and timing issues, but certainly it was a mistake for a rig to be moved and a well spudded without agreements in place and for documents to be signed without appropriate review and approval.   I understand that John Thompson and Steve made the decision to move the rig and spud the well when they had a term sheet and draft agreement that they anticipated being able to sign in short order.   Allen Wilhite and I frequently work together to get documentation finalized and in form for Steve's execution.   From Steve's reaction when I told him I had not reviewed or initialled the farmout (which had been initialled by Allen), I believe he had assumed that had been the case in this situation as well, although he did not try to place responsibility on Allen.Steve is one of the best and the brightest I've worked with at Enron.   He is extremely busy, working very hard to manage the portfolio of existing E &amp; P assets, as well as working on new deals.   I have worked with Steve enough to know that he would never have intentionally failed to follow our procedures.   I think this incident was a mistake that will not be repeated.   I will remind the ECR group at Monday's staff meeting that review by the legal department is required before any agreements are signed.Where do we go from here?   Would you like for me to arrange a meeting with Steve?   Please let me know if there is anything further you would like for me to do. Steve raises the issue of staffing in his email.   In light of the level of activity for new ECR deals, time that is required in assisting Global Finance with Condor and a funding vehicle for the VPPs, and the increased legal time required as Bonne Terre, Cypress, and Vastar are no longer managed by third parties, being able to provide quality and timely legal advice is increasingly difficult, and staffing is an issue that I hope can be addressed soon.

The circumstances of the event follow to the best of my knowledge, without confirming with Allen Wilhite who is presently inaccessible:Rozel Energy, led by Bill Rogers, identified a high potential / relatively low risk prospect in late August on acreage held by Kelley Oil &amp; Gas (sub of Contour Energy).   He commissioned a lease check and found that Kelley controlled 90%+ of the acreage, but it was set to expire on Sept. 28, 2000.Rozel, after reviewing the prospect with ECR technical personnel and receiving approval to do so, sought to acquire top leases over the prospect only to find that others had already top-leased a significant portion of the prospect.   Had the Kelley lease expired, these parties would have controlled and drilled the prospect.Rozel, with the help of Allen Wilhite, approached Kelley for a farmout.   Kelley asked to be presented with a prospect review under the concept that Kelley would be willing to farmout approximately 50% of its interest, or farmout all of its interest retaining an ORRI convertible to a WI APO or higher ORRI at its option.Kelley elected to participate for 50% of its interest in the well before the farmout agreement was drafted.   Kelley agreed to general terms in a brief letter agreement.   Kelley sought to operate the well, which ECR rejected due to Kelley's poor track record in drilling deep S. Louisiana wells.   Rozel Energy is the operator in absence of Enron having an operating vehicle.   Rozel employed a seasoned contract operator in S. Louisiana, Stokes and Speiler, who are being managed daily by Arvel Martin and Bob Devine, who each have over 25 years experience in mangement of drilling operations.Inasmuch as the operation of the well was in dispute, the negotiation of the JOA and the farmout agreement was strained and Kelley was non-responsive to Allen's efforts to finalize the agreement.   Allen, Craig Fox, Arvel Martin and I met with Kelley's Land Manager and VP of Operations and established a dialogue and rapport (we thought).   The initial draft of the farmout agreement was put together on Sept. 15th by Kelley and Allen.   Allen did not share the draft with you then as we were still apart on certain deal provisions, particularly who would operate.   ECR members were in dispute over the importance of operations.With Kelley's consent and our high level of confidence that we would reach terms with Kelley, we moved our rig in and spudded the well a few days prior to the Sept. 28th lease expiration.   Allen and I continued to be frustrated with not reaching final contract terms with Kelley after the well was spudded.   I pressed Allen to finalize an agreement and he presented an agreement signed by Kelley on October 16, 2000 (effective Sept. 15, 2000).   Following my signature and upon his departure to Kelley's offices to deliver the document, I asked him if you had reviewed JOA and he said no.   I asked him if it was required or customary for Legal to review JOAs, and he said it was sometimes done but there are rarely revisions.   I did not ask specifically about farmout agreements.   The Kelley farmout was the first farmout in a directly-owned asset that I had encountered.   I failed to recognize the distinction between numerous farmouts that I had seen executed by our GP's in our Juniper, Bonne Terre (historically) and Texland ventures, and a farmout with Enron's name on the line.It is my job as a Vice President to know what requires Legal review.   I have been made aware that farmout agreements and JOA's in directly owned assets (as opposed to LP's with a GP such as Juniper) require Legal review and signoff.   The compliance meeting last week underscored that point.   We had outside counsel (Lisa Jaubert) under your direction review the Tri-C and Manti farmout agreements and your initials are evidence of your approval. I respect you as an attorney and business partner and commit that I will be diligent about obtaining your review of agreements and ask you when in doubt as to whether legal review and approval is required on a particular item or issue.The demands that our large oil &amp; gas exploration portfolio places on you is another issue that we should discuss.   The Bonne Terre, Cypress and Vastar ventures have significant drilling activity that has commenced and will continue.   Dissolution of Bonne Terre and distribution of the assets to ENA (to be held in BT Exploration LLC) will increase the legal and commercial activity level.   We have another prospect in Cypress that is being promoted and will be spudded in the next 10 days, so expect to see a farmout agreement on the S. Riceville prospect late next week.I would be pleased to discuss these matters with you and Mark Haedicke in person if you desire.   I regret my failure to obtain your review and approval of the Kelley farmout agreement and commit to preventing a repeat of the mistake.   I am concerned about the pace of agreements that we face in the immediate future on our direct-owned ventures.   I look forward to working with you on ways to better manage our business process in Cypress-Acadian, Bonne Terre &amp; Vastar ventures. \n"

        " Rick Buy/HOU/ECT on 12/19/2000 10:26 AM ---Larry L Izzo@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT12/19/2000 10:04 AMTo: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Richard Leibert/HOU/EEES@EES Subject: DASH FOR RIOGEN MERCHANT (AKA \"ELECTROBOLT\")Rick, I was provided a copy of the DASH at 6:30 PM last evening and asked to sign off soonest.   My comments follow:Cost:   the DASH is incorrect.   EECC has provided both a cost - plus price and a guaranteed price.EECC has provided a NEPCO-guaranted price of $215MM.EECC has indicated that it's estimate of actual costs is most likely $205MM.   We indicated this cost estimate was somewhat conservative.   Since last week, the cost estimate has been further revised to $202MM.   It is unlikely that the actual costs of the project will be significantly less than $202MM.   $202MM represents a cost estimate with the Owners maintaining the risk of overruns and schedule.   This would require the Owner to maintain a contingency in his proforma above the most likely expected cost of $202MM.After providing the above information to the Developer, the Developer was going to take a look at the carrying cost of turbines which were inside this estimate; I have no update on whether the turbine price changed from the numbers I saw last week.Schedule:   Neither my team nor I had seen the provisions of termination by Petrobras, as stated in the DASH, prior to last evening.   The ability of Petrobras to terminate at April 30, 20002 if the project is not completed due to circumstances within Enron's controls, is an unlikely risk, but not totally impossible.   Further, the project is subject to a June 30, 20002, termination by Petrobras if the project is not completed due to force majeure.   This is considered more of an onerous risk.   It's not clear to me whether the requirement to complete the pipeline and bring gas to the project would be considered under Enron's control, considering that Enron is a partial Owner in CEG, the gas distribution pipeline company.On the other hand, we have indicated that an October 31, 20001 start-up, is reasonable, based on a full NTP by January 1, and site access on February 1.   If the schedule is constrained by the RAC recommendation to limit expenses to $15MM, the October 31, start-up could be at risk.Performance:   The stated agreement with Petrobras for 365 megawatts (site condition) and an average net degraded heat rate of 9169 btu/kWH, appears correct, if it is LHV.O&amp;M Guarantee:   The DASH is not clear on what O&amp;M availability guarantee Enron is prepared to sign with Petrobras.   I would suggest that OEC insure it agrees with any availability guarantees prior to Enron signing the Petrobras agreement.Rick, sorry for this late feedback, but our system of coordination with the RAC needs improvement.   In the days when I worked with EI, EECC would provide to EI a written due diligence report direct, after checking the proforma against the PPA.   This was an Enron lesson-learned after years of experience.   The recent reorganizations have diluted this procedure.   I suggest I discuss with you how to improve our due diligence process.Regards,LarryLI546000\n"

The first table highlights the two l/c's which the sponsors have committed to.   Enron would have to pick up either 65% of these (if we can get MSEB to pick up their 15% share) or 80%.   The other l/c's in the second table are solely the responsibility of DPC.   It would be up to the sponsors to decide to what extent they want to help support these.

For Corinto, the higher discount rate and lower value reflects how RAC would value this transaction as a new merchant deal, reflecting Nicaragua's downgrade; the lower discount rate is consistent with the original RAC discount rate and may be a reasonable discount rate for a completed plant to a strategic buyer.Please let me know if you require additional information.

Our Net Open Position is more accurate as a result of booking deals more reflective of batch models rather than Wholesale equivalent positions.2.)   Our P&amp;L is more accurate as a result of the position change and the ability to import retail energy curves into RPS rather than only wholesale curves.   3.)   T&amp;D positions can now be captured for Deals in RPS.4.)   Regulatory Switching Options are being captured in RPS, which captures value of EES' option to serve customers during the CTC period.5.)   Reporting capabilities are more timely and effective.The Power Team is confident that RPS will better serve our business.\n"

It reminds me of the days with Enron. Coincidentally, I haveheard that Enron office in Bangkok will be completely closed at the end ofthe year. Thai market is just not sophisticated enough for Enron. I stillhope that this great company will come back to my country again perhapswhen the power pool becomes a reality. The people I met still asked meabout Enron. Even during the annual economic seminar hosted by the USembassy in Septemder this year, one of the speaker from the US has citedEnron as an example of how good a company from the old economy has adoptedto the new environment,by trading broad band anb offer risk hedginginstruments on line,etc. Apparently, Enron does have some fans here.I, myself, will assume the position of managing director of the Postpublishing Company, the owner of Bangkok Post newspaper as from thefirst of February next year.

RAC, however, is close to finishing a new process for commodity embedded financings---both prepaids and tilted swaps---that would not require a full DASH but an abbreviated approval document based upon specified credit ratings, financing amounts, and maturities for transactions having standard credit documentation.   For example, a $25 million, five-year exposure to a AA counterparty with standard documentation is contemplated to be approved via this abbreviated approval document.   This abbreviated approval document would only be available for transactions meeting these criteria if:   (i) structured financing capacity were available, (ii) the funds flow issue created is manageable (both (i) and (ii) as confirmed by EGF), and (ii) the pricing met a threshold that included the structured financing cost, an appropriate credit spread/reserve, and a syndication risk premium.The abbreviated approval document is intended to expedite the approval of relatively straightforward embedded financings where a full DASH is impractical or inefficient.   It is presently contemplated that the abbreviated approval document could be approved with two signatures:   the Originator's and   a RAC signature (either Bill Bradford's or mine), with business unit management and EGF receiving weekly updates on transactions approved via this document, but I would welcome your thoughts on this.   In any event, I will provide you with the proposed abbreviated process by you for your review and concurrence before if it is implemented since the preponderance of these transactions are expected to be originated by ENA.Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.Regards,Dave David W Delainey111/02/2000 09:25 AMTo: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joseph Deffner/HOU/ECT@ECT, John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Commodity / Embedded Finance DealsTim, I would argue that we should pursue this business as long as a) we are being adequately compensated for the financing and underlying commodity risk; b) we have very good paper; c) we are dealing with solid credits and are charging an appropriate risk adjusted cost of capital for the underlying financing; d) we have the ability to syndicate the capital or funds flow position if needed to manage cash issues and e) that RAC is comfortable that we are reaching these goals.Any imbedded financing or $5M or more should be DASHED.   David, Joe and Mark should be your key contacts to ensure we are adequately managing these issues but I do not see any fatal flaw in the strategy if priced/managed well and we watch the funds flow issues.

There always seems to be reluctance in UK to have a dash prepared, Steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task. We all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse. Maybe Michael could be led to \"suggest\" an alternative memo or approach. A \"problem deal\" memo. If you all think a dash is the best approach do it and I don't care if they don't sign it.Once the website is functional, it will be helpful to have a complete history of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process. One final thought, Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we should pick battles carefully. Rick\n"

Whilst taking a curve other than the day end curve is relatively easy to do (once we have agreed a formal procedure and changed the IT feeds) and would give us only minor P&amp;L concerns on a daily basis there is an impact on determining and hedging our USD cashflows. This would undoubtedly be a cost to the UK business. Shane is going to put a note together to outline the issues and have a stab at attaching a monetary cost (although I expect he will have to guesstimate the amounts). Depending on the size this will need to be communicated to the business heads here in London.James   \tFrom:   Sheila Glover   19/12/2000 17:45 To: Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Shane Dallmann/LON/ECT@ECT, James New/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: UK Submission of PositionsRick,Shane Dallman and I are trying to speak with James to discuss the Libor Curve and its impact on London's reporting.   The Libor curve is published daily in Houston at 3:000 pm (CST) at the close of US Trading.

We are today implementing a flash P&amp;L process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start today with the P&amp;L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston.   I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most serious problem.James From:   Rick Buy   15/12/2000 21:59\t   To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: UK Submission of PositionsNeed your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, p&amp;L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD   interest rate curves before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management.

Can you prepare a brief presentation that would serve as a discussion document for such a meeting. The concept is that a deal flows into a website??? that is basically a checklist and the transaction is sized and scoped. If it met deal criteria and portfolio requirements, it would flow directly to an outside shop that would fund, bill, track etc. Enron could possibly keep a small interest in economics and of course a skim. Lets review presentation, then discuss with Ben/Andy and Janet D.   and proceed to banks. Ben is clearing idea with Delaney. We are shooting for a Friday (23) meeting.Thanks, Rick\n"

As you know, a remaining issue involves who is responsible for these types of hedges Corp or business unit.   The currency traders on Hickerson's desk contacted me today.   They mentioned that it is an appropriate time to put a currency hedge in place for 3 reasons:1.) The spot rate has fallen back to the 1230 KRW/USD level2.) The forward rate is relatively flat as there is no signifcant difference in 1 year rates between the two currencies.3.) Option volatilities have decreased significantly over the past month.Please let me know if (when?) we should discuss this issue further.   The currency traders mentioned that they will bubble this issue up with Jim Hughes again later today.   Thanks,Rudi\n"

Kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ TXU to pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank. Moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with TXU through the plant purchase or other structured deal. Do no more (large) deals with TXU that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm???) unless we buy a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously. Continue to stay on top of TXU with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close relationship with good communication.Lets try and discuss Wed if possible.\n"

James and I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting this changeThe revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve input validation processes on trade date.Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to deliverOfficialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( Houston 4 AM )Flash p&amp;l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( Houston 111AM )James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in delivering a trade date control process.I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.RegardsMike---",
