      "body": "\nJeff,Below is a list of items I'd like to discuss with you when we both have time(?).   I just wanted to brief you first.I'm thinking about having a meeting with the basis traders every morning from 8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk meetings.   This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone's mind.   Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in basis until 8:30?   I think it would be worth it.I think it would be a good idea to meet with leaders from other groups (origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might affect ENA's basis positions.   Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions?Should we set up a new book (under my management) which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured positions?   I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being \"cluttered up\" in different books (i.e.   the P/L from these trades would be my focus instead of managed by other traders.)   Do you think the traders could eventually report directly to me?   It seems like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group.Talk to you soon,Fletch\n"

For example, Hunter and I were in Chicago last week talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk components of their PBR.   We brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads, hedge MTD and BOM PBR price with Gas Daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc.If we can develop an EOL - dependent application that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it will reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors.Let me know what you think!Fletch\n"

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.000 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.000.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring   that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 20001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060   with any questions. (You must enter &amp; exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell &amp; Smith.)\n"
