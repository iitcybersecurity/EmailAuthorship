&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; She laughed and said, with wanton mirth, I am tasting all that's &lt; &lt;&lt; possible. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I try to eat the food I need, And do the things I should. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; But life's so short, my friend, indeed, I hate missing out on something &lt; &lt;&lt; good. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; This year I realized how old I was, She grinned, I've not been this old &lt; &lt;&lt; before. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; So, before I die, I've got to try, Those things for years I had &lt; ignored. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I've not smelled all the flowers yet, There's too many books I have not &lt; &lt;&lt; read. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; There's more fudge sundaes to wolf down, And kites to be flown &lt; overhead. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; There are many malls I have not shopped, I've not laughed at all the &lt; &lt;&lt; jokes. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I've missed a lot of Broadway Hits, And potato chips and cokes. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I want to wade again in water, And feel ocean spray upon my face. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Sit in a country church once more, And thank God for It's grace. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I want peanut butter every day, Spread on my morning toast. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I want un-timed long-distance calls, To the folks I love the most. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I've not cried at all the movies yet, Nor walked in the morning rain. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I need to feel wind in my hair, I want to fall in love again. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; So, if I choose to have dessert, Instead of having dinner. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Then should I die before night fall, I'd say I died a winner. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Because I missed out on nothing, I filled my heart's desire. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I had that final chocolate mousse, Before my life expired. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; With that, I called the waitress over, I've changed my mind, it seems. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I said, I want what she is having, Only add some more whipped-cream! &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Here is a little something for you all! &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; We need an annual Girlfriends Day! &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; If you get this twice, then you have more than one girlfriend. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Be happy. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; ALL I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT LIFE I LEARNED FROM MY GIRLFRIENDS &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Good times are even better when they're shared. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * A good long talk can cure almost anything. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Everyone needs someone with whom to share their secrets. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Listening is just as important as talking. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * An understanding friend is better than a therapist...and cheaper too! &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Laughter makes the world a happier place. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Friends are like wine; they get better with age. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Sometimes you just need a shoulder to cry on. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Great minds think alike, especially when they are female! &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * When it comes to \"bonding,\" females do it better. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * YOU ARE NEVER TOO OLD FOR SLUMBER PARTIES!!! &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Girls just want to have fun. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * It's important to make time to do \"girl things.\" &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * Calories don't count when you are having lunch (or any other food) &lt; &lt;&lt; with your girlfriends. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * You can never have too many shoes. &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; * GEMS MAY BE PRECIOUS, BUT FRIENDSHIP IS PRICELESS!!! &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO ALL OF YOUR GIRLFRIENDS &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; \n"

      "body": "\n--- Original Message ---   Subject: Kids: Gotta love them!!!Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some   children who know more about relationships than some adults. What do most people do on a date? Dates are for having fun, and people should use them   to get to know each other.   Even boys have something to say if you listen   long enough.---Lynette, age 8 On the first date, they just tell each other lies,   and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. ---Martin,   age 10What would you do if a date was not working   out?   I'd run home and play dead.   ---Craig, age   When is it okay to kiss someone? When they're rich. ---Pam,age 7 The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't   want to mess with that.   ---Curt, age   The rules goes like this:   If you kiss someone,   then you should marry them and have kids with them.   It's the right thing   to do. ---Howard, age 8How would the world be different if people weren't   married? There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,   wouldn't there?   ---Kelvin, age 8 What is the right age to get married?   No age is good to get married at.   You got to be   a fool to get married.   ---Freddie, age 6 Is it better to be single or married?   It's better for girls to be single but not for   boys.   Boys need someone to clean up after them.   ---Anita, age 9 I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one   thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.   I don't want to be all   grossed out. ---Theodore, age 8How do you decide who to marry? You got to find somebody who likes the same   stuff.   Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,   and she should keep the chips and dip coming.   ---Alan, age 10No person really decides before they grow up who   they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out   later who you're stuck with. ---Kirsten, age 10How can a stranger tell if two people are   married? You might have to guess, based on whether they seem   to be yelling at the same kids. ---Derrick, age 8 What do your mom and dad have in   common? Both don't want any more kids.   ---Lori, age   How would you make a marriage work?   Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks   like a truck. ---Ricky, age 10 \n"

        " Kim Ward/HOU/ECT on 04/10/20001 05:24 PM=\r ---\r   Continental Airlines Inc &lt;Beta_0410001@airmail.continental.com&lt; on 04/10/2000=\r1 01:18:18 PM\rTo:=09kward@ect.enron.com cc:=09=20\rSubject:=09Important Notice - New eService Online Release\r   =20\r   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   Tuesday, April 10, 20001   Dear continental.com=\r customer,   We're Changing To Serve You Better This Thursday evening Apri=\rl 12th 20001, we are launching a new version of our web reservations system,=\r eService Online.   This marks the start of an exciting new beginning as the=\r reservations platform is 1000% provided by Continental.   We're making this =\rchange because our current product, while good, will not provide us with th=\re flexibility in the future to offer the features that will make travel arr=\ranging easier and to tailor the online Continental experience for you.   He=\rre's What You Need To Know:   Your Profile Your profile information, includi=\rng your username (KWARD1) and password, has been transferred to the new ver=\rsion of eService Online.   To protect your personal information, credit card=\r information has not been transferred.   You will need to update your profil=\re.   Your Itineraries Information on your reservations created before April =\r12th will not be saved. If you want to keep a copy for your records, you wi=\rll need to print them prior to 9pm/CDT April 12th.   This change does not af=\rfect the status of any previous reservations and tickets, but you can not v=\riew them in the new eService Online.   Signing In To enhance security, you=\r will have to sign in for each transaction session to reserve and purchase =\rflights.   This means you will have to use your password each time.   To have=\r your password e-mailed to you   click here .   You are strongly encouraged t=\ro sign in at the beginning of the travel arranging process.   24 Hour Hold =\rOption To prepare for this Thursday's release we will be turning off the \"H=\rold for 24 hours\" option.   The \"Hold\" option will not be available between =\rApril 10 and April 12.   Here Are Some of the Changes   More eTicketing The =\rnew eService Online offers expanded opportunities for electronic tickets (e=\rTickets).   We can now provide eTickets for code share flights operated by N=\rorthwest Airlines or Northwest Airlink (CO5000-8059) and America West Airli=\rnes (CO2000-2349).   Aircraft Seat Maps We rearranged the seat map pages fo=\rr easier viewing. We also enhanced the seat selection process and enabled E=\rlite-status available seating.   Pricing   The pricing system is enhanced to=\r deliver more current fares based on your selection of either \"Search By Lo=\rwest Fares\" or \"Search By Schedule.\"   We also added a gold star to denote \"=\rcontinental.com promotional fares,\" so you know for certain when you receiv=\re a discounted, online-only airfare.   Customer Service   Our customer servi=\rce is streamlined and enhanced as Continental employees now handle all supp=\rort for online inquiries and reservations services.   While we've made a nu=\rmber of improvements to the overall experience, this new version may not, o=\rn the surface, appear to offer significant benefits.   These changes lay the=\r foundation for outstanding capabilities we have planned for the future.   W=\re welcome your comments and suggestions as we move ahead.   Based on feedbac=\rk from customers, we're already at work adding enhancements.   Overall, we'r=\re confident that you will appreciate the changes and improvements and look =\rforward to continuing to serve you in the future.   Sincerely, Continental A=\rirlines Inc.   This is a one-time update e-mail.   You have been sent this e=\r-mail as a registered eService Online user to inform you of this change in =\rservice.   If you have questions or comments, or you would like to unsubscri=\rbe please reply to: eservice@coair.com   This E-mail was sent to: kward@ect=\r.enron.com   [IMAGE] [IMAGE] =09\r [IMAGE]\r\n"

I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.   I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.   I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.   2.   If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.   United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.3.   If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?JRW ---Original Message---From: \tWard, Kim   Sent:\tMonday, April 02, 20001 2:14 PMTo:\tWilliams, Jason R.Cc:\tTycholiz, BarrySubject:\tRe: CalPeak Power RFP - ShortlistJ. -What's your take on this?

I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.   I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.   I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.   2.   If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.   United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.3.   If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?JRW ---Original Message---From: \tWard, Kim   Sent:\tMonday, April 02, 20001 2:14 PMTo:\tWilliams, Jason R.Cc:\tTycholiz, BarrySubject:\tRe: CalPeak Power RFP - ShortlistJ. -What's your take on this?

Under Term, you have included the phrase \"with annual redetermination\" however I find no redetermination language in the Price   section.   I would suggest that the phrase be deleted.2.   Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum such as 2000% of the expected volumes.   Any thoughts relating to a cap?3.   Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.   Is this correct?   and if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?   \tOtherwise, the term sheet appears okay.   \t\t\tDan\tKim Ward 03/29/20001 03:52 PM \t   To: Dan Hyvl   cc:   Subject: Eastern New Mexico Gas Company\tDan,Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 20001.

Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.Also,   I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.

Term:   PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 20003.   That is really 20003 - 20004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.   Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.   This would be OK with us.2.   Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.   Why would they want this?   This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.   We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.3.   Pricing:   Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?   I think that is what we proposed.   If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of   transport plus fuel.4.   Conditions:   Noms must be in at 8:000 am.   This is very important and the a deal killer.   We need time to manage the position.   Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.   As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.   If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.   If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.   We might be able to craft a solution to this however.Chris \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp.

What do most people do on a date? Dates are for having fun, and people should use them   to get to know each other.   Even boys have something to say if you listen   long enough.---Lynette, age 8 On the first date, they just tell each other lies,   and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. ---Martin,   age 10What would you do if a date was not working   out?   I'd run home and play dead.   ---Craig, age   When is it okay to kiss someone? When they're rich. ---Pam,age 7 The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't   want to mess with that.   ---Curt, age   The rules goes like this:   If you kiss someone,   then you should marry them and have kids with them.   It's the right thing   to do. ---Howard, age 8How would the world be different if people weren't   married? There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,   wouldn't there?   ---Kelvin, age 8 What is the right age to get married?   No age is good to get married at.   You got to be   a fool to get married.   ---Freddie, age 6 Is it better to be single or married?   It's better for girls to be single but not for   boys.   Boys need someone to clean up after them.   ---Anita, age 9 I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one   thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.   I don't want to be all   grossed out. ---Theodore, age 8How do you decide who to marry? You got to find somebody who likes the same   stuff.   Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,   and she should keep the chips and dip coming.   ---Alan, age 10No person really decides before they grow up who   they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out   later who you're stuck with. ---Kirsten, age 10How can a stranger tell if two people are   married? You might have to guess, based on whether they seem   to be yelling at the same kids. ---Derrick, age 8 What do your mom and dad have in   common? Both don't want any more kids.   ---Lori, age   How would you make a marriage work?   Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks   like a truck. ---Ricky, age 10 &lt;Embedded StdOleLink&lt;\n"

Your timely review and comments are greatly   appreciated. The Alternate Nominations language is being separately provided at the   request of PPL so that they can review it.   If they would like to have it   incorporated, it can easily incorporated into the proposal and/or agreement. Chris, I used the working draft of the Enron/Citizens agreement from our   meeting last Monday in Houston to draft the Alternate Nominations language.   That draft did not provide for a price differentiation for nominations   between 8:30 and 9:000 am CPT.   Should there be one? Best regard, John John A.

(TEP) has signed a five-year wholesale contract to supply 60megawatts of electricity to Phelps Dodge Energy Services.   The contract calls for TEP, beginning in March of 20001, to supplythe power at all times except during the company's peak customerenergy demand periods from July through September of each year.   TEP Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer James S.Pignatelli said the contract is an important one for both companies.\"This agreement provides a comfort factor for Phelps Dodge as it plansahead for its energy needs,\" Pignatelli said. \"And for TEP, thecontract provides a stable, profitable margin for five years and asolid boost to our financial outlook in a volatile energy market.\"   Pignatelli said the company expects the agreement to generaterevenues of about $30 million annually.   The contract gives Phelps Dodge the option of receiving the powerat several of its operations outside TEP's service territory. Underthe contract, TEP also can interrupt delivery of power to Phelps Dodgeif the utility experiences significant loss of any electric generatingresources.   Separate from this agreement, the Phelps Dodge Sierrita copper andmolybdenum mine south of Tucson is a TEP retail customer.   TEP is the primary subsidiary of UniSource Energy Corp.(NYSE: UNS), and Arizona's second-largest investor-owned electricutility.   TEP Public Affairs   P.O.

      "body": "\n   Dan:To help your prepare for your meeting in Stamford, here are some thoughts.PG&amp;E Large Packages Index Trends1.   PG&amp;E Large Packages is the interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern into PG&amp;E.   The interconnection between El Paso/Transwestern and Kern into SoCal is referred to as SoCal Border.   2.   PG&amp;E gas supply comes in from three main pipelines:   PGT (Canada), El Paso/Transwestern (San Juan and Permian) and Kern River (Rockies).   With the exception of a few very cold days in Canada and the Northwest, the cheapest supply comes from Canada.   The other two pipes are similarly priced, based on the incremental cost of gas out of the Southwest and what options the supply has.   There is always some marginal demand for supply out of the Southwest into PG&amp;E, but it can be a small number of only about 5000,000 MMBtu/d in a shoulder month and 1,000,000 MMBtu on a peak day.   When it is a low demand day PG&amp;E large packages will trade like Malin (PGT interconnect to PG&amp;E).   On a peak day PG&amp;E large packages trades like SoCal border.3.   Effective April 1, El Paso changed the way gas moves on their system.   It used that anyone with primary delivery point capacity to PG&amp;E could deliver into SoCal on a primary basis.   Now, if you have PG&amp;E primary, you can only get into SoCal on an alternate delivery point basis.   Because capacity is constrained, PG&amp;E primary capacity will generally not flow into SoCal.   Thisis why PG&amp;E Large Packages trades at a discount to SoCal Border.4.   PG&amp;E large packages is the relevant index for the PP&amp;L deal:   PG&amp;E trades at a significant discount to SoCal because of the reasons listed above.   Anyone with primary SoCal delivery will want to go into SoCal.   This leaves the PG&amp;E capacity as the marginal capacity that folks could use for delivery to Griffith.   If anyone owns primary delivery into SoCal they will use it there.   Citizens is offering Griffith a discount relative to these suppliers.   The good news is that PG&amp;E delivery is still very strong because given the gas supply balance in California the marginal supply out of the southwest is needed.   5.   PG&amp;E large packages is becoming more liquid:   Now that El Paso has changed the way gas moves on their pipeline there is a much more distinct difference between the types of capacity on El Paso.   Folks that own capacity want ways to hedge its value.   Enron has recognized this and plans to introduce the PG&amp;E large packages point on Enron Online, our internet based trading system.   Trading volume at the PG&amp;E point has increased in the last month and is expected to continue to increase.   This is good for Citizens as the liquidity makes the index more reflective of the market.   It also reduces the risk that the index doesn't print as has often occurred in the past.   (See historical data attached).   It also reduces the spread between the bid and offer at that point.6.   PG&amp;E Large Packages has gotten much stronger:   it used to be that the San Juan/SoCal Border spreads barely covered variable transport expense.   Now the demand is much stronger in CA and the transportation value has increased.   California is short storage due to growth in demand with the new power plants and the strong economy.   Although demand due to the economy is likely to fall, the new power plants and short storage position still create a very bullish situation.   For example, current valuations for the PG&amp;E index are in the attached spreadsheet below: \n"

The desk is going to start posting prices for it on EOL in order to add more liquidity.   As you can see, there are days where there were no prices published for this point in Gas Daily.As for Griffith, maybe PG&amp;E topock should be the benchmark because Citizens truly doesn't have an alternative market.   Although they can change their primary delivery point to the border, the fact is that it probobly wouldn't flow because the line is already full.   Where can Citizens actually (not theoretically) extract the greatest value for this capacity?   I disagree with Griffiths comment that this price is more reflective of the market - what market?   Very little has traded there in the past.One issue that we/Citizens needs to think about is hedging capabilities to PG&amp;E topock.   I know when we were talking to them about our capacity, we priced it based on the SJ/Socal spread and they were agreeable to that.   But then again, we could actually flow gas to the border.Sorry for rambling - \n"

It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 555% of normal.   This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.   Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 42000 MWH to California.   Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.

Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc   and the friday price is published on Monday.   Or do you want to use and average of the price applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the weekend period.   Just questions to consider.

Please\t&lt; come in and have something to eat.\"\t&lt;\t&lt; \"Is the man of the house home?\", they asked.\t&lt;\t&lt; \"No,\" she said. \"He's out.\"\t&lt;\t&lt; \"Then we cannot come in,\" they replied.\t&lt;\t&lt; In the evening when her husband came home, she told\t&lt; him what had\t&lt; happened.\"Go tell them I am home and invite them in!\"\t&lt;\t&lt; The woman went out and invited the men in. \"We do not\t&lt; go into a House\t&lt; together,\" they replied.\t&lt;\t&lt; \"Why is that?\" she wanted to know.\t&lt;\t&lt; One of the old men explained: \"His name is Wealth,\" he\t&lt; said pointing to\t&lt; one of his friends, and said pointing to another one,\t&lt; \"He is Success,\t&lt; and I am Love.\"\t&lt;\t&lt; Then he added, \"Now go in and discuss with your\t&lt; husband which one of us\t&lt; you want in your home.\"\t&lt;\t&lt; The woman went in and told her husband what was said.\t&lt; Her husband was\t&lt; overjoyed. \"How nice!!!,\" he said. \"Since that is the\t&lt; case, let us\t&lt; invite\t&lt; Wealth. Let him come and fill our home with wealth!\"\t&lt;\t&lt; His wife disagreed. \"My dear, why don't we invite\t&lt; Success?\"\t&lt;\t&lt; Their daughter-in-law was listening from the other\t&lt; corner of the house.\t&lt; She jumped in with her own suggestion: \"Would it not\t&lt; be better to\t&lt; invite\t&lt; Love?\t&lt; Our home will then be filled with love!\"\t&lt;\t&lt; \"Let us heed our daughter-in-law's advice,\" said the\t&lt; husband to his\t&lt; wife. \"Go out and invite Love to be our guest.\"\t&lt;\t&lt; The woman went out and asked the 3 old men, \"Which one\t&lt; of you is Love?\t&lt; Please come in and be our guest.\"\t&lt;\t&lt; Love got up and started walking toward the house. The\t&lt; other 2 also got\t&lt; up and followed him. Surprised, the lady asked Wealth\t&lt; and Success: \"I\t&lt; only invited Love, Why are you coming in?\"\t&lt;\t&lt; The old men replied together: \"If you had invited\t&lt; Wealth or Success,\t&lt; the\t&lt; other two of us would've stayed out, but since you\t&lt; invited Love,\t&lt; wherever He goes, we go with him. Wherever there is\t&lt; Love, there is also\t&lt; Wealth and Success!!!\"\t&lt;\t&lt; OUR WISH FOR YOU...\t&lt;\t&lt; Where there is pain, we wish you peace and mercy.\t&lt;\t&lt; Where there is self-doubting, we wish you a renewed\t&lt; confidence   in Your\t&lt; Ability to work through them.\t&lt;\t&lt; Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, we wish you\t&lt; understanding,\t&lt; patience, and renewed strength.\t&lt;\t&lt; Where there is fear, we wish you love, and courage.\t&lt;\t&lt; You have two choices right now:\t&lt; 1.

Although the Austrailia trip sounds really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.   Also, I did commit to doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!!   Anyway, can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?   Maybe the place you are taking your lessons to be an instructor?   I would appreciate any recommendations!!!   Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when I get back.Have a great weekend,Kim Ward\n"
