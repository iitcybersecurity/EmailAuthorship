The latest example of the inmates running the asylum:On the final play of the Tide's loss to Central Florida, senior fullbackDustin McClintock blocked Central Florida freshman Commer Rucker to theground, sat on him and reportedly punched him several times in the face.DuBose told one reporter he didn't want to comment until he spoke toMcClintock.According to media reports in Alabama, DuBose is \"concerned\" that somethinglike that had happened for the second week in a row. Concerned enough totake harsh disciplinary action such as suspending the guilty party for partof the next game?Cheap shots are getting to be a habit at Bama. In the closing minutes of theTennessee game, Alabama's Hirchel Bolden took out his frustrations with ashot to the chin of UT punter David Leaverton, who was nearly 45 yards fromwhere the punt was rolling on the turf. Leaverton required 9 stitches to hisface.Because no penalty was called, some Tide supporters defended Bolden. Thefollowing day, DuBose said such behavior wouldn't be tolerated. However, histhreat rings hollow because he never backed it up with stiff sanctions.McClintock obviously never got the message. His actions and DuBose'sreaction (or lack thereof) speak volumes about the state of the Tide'sprogram.\n"

I have had Victor Guggenheim review the following deals in tagg stage but you may want to review as well and let me know if everything looks alright.QT8025   Dynegy CanadaQT8034   TransCanadaThis logic will create the two legs for the price and basis swaps when a counterparty with a master agreement with ECC hits a US product.   The first leg will be between ECC and the external counterparty and risk assigned to FT-US/CAND-ERMS.   The second leg is simply the flip from FT-US/CAND-ERMS to the appropriate US book (the book mapped at the product level).   These examples illustrate this logic.   This logic is also set up for the 40+ counterparties that have the master agreements with ECC.If you see any problems with the example deals or in the logic described above, please call me before end of business today so we can stop this from going into production.   Please forward to you groups to inform them of the change.   Please let us immediately if something is not correct on these deals on Monday.Thank you,Dawn\n"

Please put any future requests in there so that we can keep track of who needs off when.   I would like to try and keep from having more than 3 people out at a time.2.   Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.   These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly swaps.   This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader at gas daily as opposed to mid.   This is very important to avoid OA variances.3.   When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.   This is important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct gd curve.4.   I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the process and how to prepare forms.5.   Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.   All the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the positions that they do.   The only request I have had is that we sit there quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.   Please utilize this opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for career development.6. I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your training plans.Please shout with any questions.PL\n"

The problem here lies in that they were wanting to do these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing.   This is not an option.Therefore, the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections.   We must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty initially.   Our credit risk exposure is the bottom line. If we do not have all the deals to the right counterparty each day, we may not be receiving enough money on Letter of Credit from CP's.   FYI, this is going to be a highly visible area for us to make mistakes.   If we continue to make these mistakes, we as a group will catch severe fire.   To help us do this correctly, Bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list on a monthlly basis.   We will still have emails sent denoting CP name changes, I reccomend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future reference.   If all else fails and there is something you are not sure about, please call Bianca Ornelas at   5-3782.If you have any questions, please give me a shout.   Thanks.PL\n"

Here is what I've come across.   Could you please flip these deals before the end of the week.FT-EASTFT-ONTARIOG-DAILY-ESTGD-CENTRALAs far as I know, these are the only deals that still need to be flipped.   I've gone through all the other books that I couldthink of, but I might have missed some.   Could you please make sure that I'm not missing any deals.   Please let me know if you have any questions on this, and please let me know when these have been flipped.Thanks for all your help again.Stacey\n"

He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years in Haleyville, Alabama.   Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2 grandchildren and one great grandchild.   Dr. Burgess was an avid golfer and tremendous football fan.   He held Auburn football season tickets for 50 years.   Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.   Dr Burgess was a World War II veteran.   Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and both grandchildren to school on the plains.   Due to his love for Auburn that he instilled in his family, there will definitely be a forth generation Auburn graduate in the Burgess family.   Dr. Burgess was also a proud member of the OTS vetinary fraternity at Auburn University.   Dr. Burgess was born in Cullman County, Alabama and was a 50 year resident of Haleyville, Alabama.   Please feel free to take some liberties and rearrange or omit some of the things I stated above.   Thanks again Sam for all of your help with this and the recognition this newsletter will give my grandfather.   Auburn is very fortunate to have such a great person raising money for the most important school within the University. Talk to you soon.PL\n"

The judge&lt; ordered the association to hold a new election in two weeks.&lt; Voting for a new slate of alumni leaders is traditionally a low-key&lt; affair, but it turned into high drama when an alternative slate of&lt; candidates was put forward at the last minute and at least 150 people&lt; showed up to vote. Beneath all the accusations --- that proxies were&lt; improperly collected and that fax machines were jammed to prevent opposing&lt; votes --- is the real issue: Next month, voters in Alabama will decide&lt; whether to amend the state constitution to change the way that Auburn's&lt; trustees are elected. If the referendum passes, as it is expected to,&lt; leaders of the alumni association will have a say in the selection of&lt; trustees.&lt; The amendment calls for the creation of a nominating committee consisting&lt; of the governor, two trustees, and two directors of the alumni&lt; association's board. Currently, trustees are appointed by the governor.&lt; On Saturday, seven nominees --- a new president, vice president, and five&lt; other members --- were to have been elected to the association's board. The&lt; slate, which was put forward in July by the association's nominating&lt; committee, included some people who have pushed for changes in the way&lt; that Auburn's trustees are elected. The proposed changes on this year's&lt; ballot include a measure that would establish term limits for Auburn's&lt; trustees and that would allow alumni who live outside of Alabama to serve&lt; as trustees, as well as involve alumni leaders in the selection of&lt; trustees. That's the legislation that will go before voters.&lt; Less than a week before the alumni association vote was to take place, an&lt; alternative slate for all the posts but president was put forward by the&lt; nominee for president, Golda McDaniels. Ms. McDaniels could not be reached&lt; for comment, but critics of the new slate believe that Ms. McDaniel was&lt; nervous about whether she would really be elected and sought proxy votes&lt; in her behalf from many alumni, including a controversial and long-time&lt; Auburn trustee, Robert E. Lowder.&lt; Mr. Lowder has opposed efforts to change the way trustees are selected,&lt; and his critics speculate that he saw an opening when Ms. McDaniels asked&lt; for his support: He planned to get her to put forward a whole new slate&lt; for all the other posts to be elected by proxy votes. The suggestion is&lt; that Mr. Lowder wanted to \"take over\" the alumni association so he and his&lt; allies could maintain control over the Board of Trustees.&lt; \"We failed to realize the steps that Mr. Lowder will go to to not allow&lt; any alumni involvement in the election of trustees,\" said Andy Hornsby, a&lt; nominee to the alumni association's board and an outspoken advocate of&lt; changing the trustee-selection process.&lt; Mr. Lowder called the charges \"ridiculous.\" He said his only involvement&lt; was that Ms. McDaniel had asked for his proxy vote and he had agreed to&lt; give it. \"I was just trying to help the lady,\" he said, noting that she&lt; would be the first woman elected president of the alumni association. \"I&lt; get blamed for everything over there,\" he said. Mr. Lowder accused the&lt; supporters of the original slate of improperly adjourning the meeting&lt; because they didn't have enough proxy votes to win.&lt; While Auburn's homecoming game against Louisiana Tech was going on, alumni&lt; leaders were meeting in Lee County Circuit Court, where Judge Jake Walker&lt; denied Ms. McDaniel's request to reconvene the election meeting and her&lt; request to end the period for proxy votes. Instead, the judge told the&lt; alumni association to hold a new election.&lt;&lt; Resa M.

All you liberals&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;can just kiss my big, white Texas ass if you think I'm gonna&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;spew a boatload of bipartisan bullshit. Let's set the record&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;straight here. I won, dammit. Hell, I won FOUR OR FIVE&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;TIMES, you stupid bastards. We got the Presidency, we got&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Congress, and by the end of four years we'll have even more&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;of the Supreme Court. The Republicans are here, and we're&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;gonna show you how it's done.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Ya'll want me to reach across party lines now? How 'bout I&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;reach across and bitch-slap all your sorry-liberal-monkey-&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;asses? How'dya like that?   Don't get me wrong, here. The&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;sense of satisfaction I'm feeling right now isn't that I've won&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;- it's that I won't have to listen to Al Gore bitch and moan&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;about \"letting every vote count\". The only reason this went&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;as far as it did is because you Democrats have a playground&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;crybaby as your poster-boy, and I for one am glad I won't&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;have to see him on TV anymore. This might sound snippy,&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Mr. Gore, but as we used to say in the sandlot...LOSERS&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;WALK!!!&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;As I said in my campaign, I promised to be a president who&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;focuses on education. My first task as President will be to&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;start an educational program for all you Florida-idiots who&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;can't tell your elbow from your asshole or how to poke a&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;stylus through the right hole.

Let the \"real thing\"   sit for one hour, then flush clean. 4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains   from vitreous china. 5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the   bumper with a crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in   Coca-Cola. 6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of   Coca-Cola over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 7.To loosen a   rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the rusted bolt for several   minutes. 8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking   pan;rap the ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is   finished, remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a   sumptuous brown gravy. 9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke   into a load of greasy clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.   The Coca-Cola will help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze   fromyour windshield.   FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It   will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the   concentrate) the commercial truck must use the Hazardous material place cards   reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 3.The distributors of coke have   been using it to clean the engines of their trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!   No joke. Think what coke and other soft drinks do to your teeth on a daily   basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of coke in 24-48 hours.   \n"

George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on&lt;these rules:&lt;I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question and deliver&lt;rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters. Theopponent&lt;will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens&lt;into voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper&lt;softly while he continues to spew   incomprehensible statistics for three&lt;more minutes.&lt;&lt;Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name ofa&lt;downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that&lt;strains the bounds of common sense?&lt;Gore: As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love&lt;the way we have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage,the&lt;downtrodden have a clear choice in this election. My opponent wants to&lt;cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans.   I, on the other hand,&lt;want&lt;to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad lockbox so they can't hurtold&lt;people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight. Mrs.&lt;Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for&lt;gas so that&lt;she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me. Also,&lt;herpoodle&lt;has arthritis.&lt;&lt;Lehrer: Gov. Bush, your rebuttal.&lt;&lt;Bush: Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying&lt;with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.   I&lt;want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my&lt;opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush.&lt;&lt;Lehrer: Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic&lt;were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be ableto&lt;pronounce his name?&lt;&lt;Bush: The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy&lt;and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about&lt;that&lt;guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick would&lt;present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then Dick would&lt;tell me&lt;which one to choose. You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough&lt;foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New&lt;Mexico.&lt;&lt;Lehrer: Mr. Gore, your rebuttal.&lt;&lt;Gore: Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in.&lt;I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of poison&lt;gas in World War I.   I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.   And&lt;when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a&lt;way&lt;that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. If I'm entrusted with&lt;the office of president, I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat,&lt;foreign or domestic, by putting it in an iron clad lockbox. Because the&lt;American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple&lt;metaphors.&lt;&lt;Lehrer: Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security&lt;system?&lt;&lt;Gore: It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I have&lt;proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to&lt;every&lt;senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny&lt;until&lt;the year 22250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the next10&lt;years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free&lt;to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them&lt;with the child-proof cap.&lt;&lt;Lehrer: Gov. Bush?&lt;&lt;Bush: That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to&lt;do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'mgoing&lt;to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroofthe&lt;sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.&lt;&lt;Lehrer: It's time for closing statements.&lt;&lt;Gore: I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, but I&lt;will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the&lt;White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.&lt;Bush: It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no&lt;onebut Republicans.&lt;&lt;Lehrer: Good night.\n"

They can juggle 53 numbers and pick 6 for the Florida Lotto, as well as select their Pick 3, Fantasy Five, and Mega Ball numbers. They can read 5 papers, 4 scratch sheets, and handicap 3 horses in the Tri-fecta at the horse race. They can spot a shanked golf ball in an acre of elephant grass 3000 yards away. They can eyeball a non-resident in a 1,000-unit subdivision at 2000 yds. They can report a scarred manatee at 10 fathoms to the Greenpeace hotline. They can take 37 different colored pills every morning and never mess it up. But they can't read a 4-line ballot both published in the newspaper AND mailed to them a week in advance and pick one candidate... You figure it out !!!

I   went to McDonald's. I looked at the menu&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;and saw that you   could have an order of 6, 9 or 12 Chicken&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;McNuggets. I asked for a half   dozen nuggets \"We don't have a&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;half-dozen nuggets,\" said the teenager at the   counter. \"You&lt; &lt;don't?\"&lt; &lt; &lt;I&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;replied.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;We only have   six, nine or twelve,\" was the reply. \"So I can't&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;order a half dozen   nuggets but I can order six?\" \"That'sright.\"&lt; &lt;So&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;I shook my   head and ordered six   McNuggets.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   ===&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;MAKES YOU WONDER HOW THESE PEOPLE CAN   SURVIVE!!!&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;A lady at work was seen putting a   credit card into her floppy&lt; &lt;drive&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;and pulling it out very   quickly. When inquired as to what she&lt; was&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;doing,   she said she was shopping on the Internet and theyasked&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;for a credit   card number, so she's using the   ATM\"thingy\".&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   ===&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   I recently saw a distraught young lady weeping beside&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;her car.   \"Do you need some help?\" I asked. She replied, \"Iknew&lt; I&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;should have replaced the battery to this remote door unlocker.&lt; Now&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;can't get into my car. Do you think they (pointing to&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;not-to-distant convenient store) would have a battery to   fit&lt; &lt;this?\"&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;\"Hmm, I dunno. Do you have an alarm   too?\" I asked. \"No, just&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;this remote thingy,\" she answered,   handing it and the car keys&lt; to&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;me.   As I took the key   and manually unlocked the door, I&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;replied, \"Why don't you   drive over there and check about the&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;batteries it's a long   walk.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   ===&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;Several years ago, we had an intern who was none too&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;swift. One   day she was typing and turned to a secretary and&lt; said,&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;\"I'm   almost out of typing paper. What do I   do?\"&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;'Just use copier   machine paper,\" the secretary told&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;her. With that, the   intern took her last remaining blank piece&lt; of&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;paper, put it on   the photocopier and proceeded to make five&lt; &lt;\"blank\"&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;copies.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   ===&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;I was in a car dealership a while ago, when a large&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;motor home   was towed into the garage. The front of the vehicle&lt; was&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;in   dire need of repair and the whole thing generally lookedlike&lt; &lt; &lt;an&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;extra in \"Twister\". I asked the manager what had   happened. He&lt; told&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;me that the driver had set the \"cruise   control\" and then wentin&lt; &lt; &lt;the&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;back to make a sandwich.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;   ===&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;IDIOTS AT WORK...&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;Sign   in a gas station: Coke --- 49 cents.

Employees in the field callhim&lt; &lt; &lt;when&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;they have problems with their computers. One night he got acall&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;from a woman in one of the branch banks that had thisquestion:&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;\"I've got smoke coming from the back of my   terminal.

It was a Paul Harvey story   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt; So please pass it on !!!   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;Conveniently Forgotten Facts ??? &lt;? &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;Back in 1969 a group of Black Panthers decided that a fellow   &lt;&lt; black &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;panther named Alex Rackley needed to die.? Rackley was &lt;suspected &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;of disloyalty.? Rackley was first tied to a chair.? Once   safely &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;immobilized his 'friends' tortured him   for hours by, among other &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;things, pouring boiling water   on him. &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;When they got tired of torturing Rackley, Black Panther member &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;Warren Kimbo took Rackley   outside and put a bullet in his head. &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;Rackley's body was later found   floating in a river about 25 &lt;miles &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;north of New Haven, Conn.? Perhaps at this point you're   curious &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;as to what happened to these Black Panthers.? In 19777, that's   &lt;&lt; only &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;eight years later, only one of the killers was still in jail.   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   &lt;? &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;The shooter, Warren Kimbro,   managed to get a scholarship to &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? Harvard. &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;He later became an assistant dean at Eastern Connecticut State &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;College.? Isn't that   something? As a '60s radical you can pump &lt;a   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   &lt;? &lt;bullet into someone's head, and a few years later, in the   same &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? state, you can become an   assistant college dean!? Only in &lt;America! &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;Erica Huggins was the lady who   served the Panthers by boiling &lt;the &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;water for Mr. Rackley's   torture.? Some years later Ms. Huggins &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;was elected to a California   School Board. &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;How in the world do you think these killers got off so easy?   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   Maybe &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;it was in some part due to the   efforts of two people who came &lt;to &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;the defense of the   Panthers.? These two people actually went so &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;far as to shut down Yale   University with demonstrations in &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;defense of the accused Black Panthers during their trial. &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;One of these people was none   other than Bill Lan Lee. Mr. Lee,   &lt;or &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;Lan Lee, as the case may be, isn't a college dean.? He isn't   a &lt;&lt; &lt;??? member   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   &lt;? &lt;of a California School Board. He is now head of the US   Justice &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;Department's Civil Rights Division.? O.K., so who was the   other &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;Panther defender? &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;Is this other notable Panther defender now a school board &lt;member? &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? Is this other Panther   apologist now an assistant college dean? &lt;&lt; No, &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;Neither!? The other Panther defender was, like Lee, a radical   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   &lt;? &lt;law student at Yale University at the time.? She is now   known &lt;as &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;The \"smartest woman in the world.\" &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;She is none other than the   Democratic candidate for the US &lt;Senate &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;from the State of New York---our lovely First Lady, the &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt;incredible Hillary Rodham Clinton. &lt;&lt; &lt;??? &lt;?   &lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;??? &lt;? &lt;And now; as Paul Harvey says;   you know (the rest of the story).   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   &lt;? &lt;Pass this on!? She deserves the press...   &lt;&lt; &lt;???   &lt;? &lt; ???   ???   \n"

I'd really like   for them to know about hand-medown clothes and homemade ice cream and   leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I really would. I hope you learn humility by being   humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated.I hope you learn   to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. And I reallyhope nobody   gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.It will be good if at   least one time you can see puppies born and your old dog put tosleep. I hope   you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.I hope you   have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it's all right if   youhave to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to   crawl under thecovers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. When   you want to see a movieand your little sister wants to tag along, I hope   you'll let her.I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your   friends and that you live in atown where you can do it safely. On rainy days   when you have to catch a ride, I hopeyou don't ask your 'driver' to drop you   two blocks away so you won't be seen ridingwith someone as uncool as your   Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dadteaches you how to make one   instead of buying one.I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read   books. When you learn to use computers,I hope you also learn to add and   subtract in your head.I hope you get teased by your friends when you   have your first crush on a girl, andwhen you talk back to your mother that   you learn what Ivory soap tastes like.May you skin your knee climbing a   mountain, burn your hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.   I don't care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don't like it. And if a   friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your   friend.I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma and   go fishing with your Uncle.May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy   during the holidays.I hope your Mother punishes you when you throw a   baseball through a neighbor'swindow and that she hugs you and kisses you at   Christmas time when you give her a mold of your hand.These things I wish   for you: tough times and disappointment, hard work and happiness.To me, it's   the only way to appreciate life.Send this to all of your friends that   mean the most to you but, don't send it back towhoever sent it to you. They   have already read it and you don't need to show them that you are a good friend.   They already know!\"We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by   doing them.\"Paul Harvey - \"Good Day\"!\n"

You never know who you might save by sending this e-mail! Please&lt;take the time and forward this to any friend who&lt;has children and grandchildren!   Thanks!&lt;&lt;I wanted to share something that happened today while shopping at Sam's&lt;Club. A mother was leaning over looking for meat and turned around to find&lt;her 4 yr. old daughter was missing. I was standing there right beside her,&lt;and she was calling her daughter with no luck. I asked a man who worked at&lt;Sam's to announce it over the loud speaker for Katie. He did, and let me&lt;say&lt;he immediately walked right past me when I asked and went to a pole where&lt;there was a phone.&lt;&lt;He made an announcement for all the doors and gates To be locked, a code&lt;something. So they locked all the doors at once.   This took all of 3&lt;minutes&lt;after I asked the guy to do this. They found the&lt;little girl 5 minutes later in a bathroom stall.   Her head was half shaved,&lt;and she was dressed in her underwear with a bag of clothes, a razor, and&lt;wig&lt;sitting on the floor beside her to make her look different.&lt;&lt;Whoever this person was, took the little girl, brought her into the&lt;bathroom, shaved half her head, and undressed her in a matter of less than&lt;10 minutes. This makes me shake to no end.&lt;&lt;Please keep a close eye on your kids when in big places where it's easy for&lt;you to get separated.   It only took a few minutes to do - all of another 5&lt;minutes and she would have been out the door.&lt;I am still in   shock that some sick person could do this, let alone in a&lt;matter of minutes.&lt;&lt;The days are over when our little ones could run rampant all over the place&lt;and nothing worse would happen then them annoying people.   The little girl&lt;is fine.   Thank God for fast workers who didn't&lt;take any   chances.&lt;&lt;BE SURE TO FORWARD THIS TO EVERYONE, SO THEY KNOW JUST HOW SICK PEOPLE ARE&lt;OUT THERE!!! (This happened at the Sam's Wholesale Club in Omaha,&lt;Nebraska.)&lt;&lt;&lt;This message has been added to the story above:&lt;&lt;I received this e-mail from one of my friends today.   Let me first tell you&lt;that I work at the Sam's club in Lincoln, NE.   The code that was spoken of&lt;is called a &amp;quot;Code Adam&amp;quot; It is named after John Walsh's (of&lt;Americas most wanted) son Adam who was kidnapped and murdered many&lt;years ago. It is used in all Sam's Clubs, Wal-marts, and Wal-mart super&lt;centers to locate lost children.&lt;&lt;This is how it works.   If by some means you have been separated with your&lt;child tell the nearest employee!   The employee will page a &amp;quot;Code&lt;Adam&amp;quot; (missing child in the store) over the&lt;intercom system followed by a description of the child (height, weight,&lt;hair&lt;color, age, name, etc).&lt;&lt;When that page goes out all the exits are immediately guarded, and/or&lt;locked&lt;in some cases, also every employee will stop whatever they are doing no&lt;matter what it is and help look for the missing child.   This will continue&lt;until the child is found.   If the child is not found within a reasonable&lt;time then the police are notified and the store will conduct a aisle by&lt;aisle search.&lt;&lt;So if ever you are separated from your child now you know what to do.&lt;Missing children pictures hang by the exits of all Wal-mart and Sam's Club&lt;stores, please take a few minutes to look these over as you leave, you just&lt;might have seen one of the children on them and you might be the one to&lt;give there parents hope and give the police a new lead in finding them.&lt;&lt;Thank you.&lt;&lt;Sincerely,&lt;Rudy Magee&lt;Sam's Club #6413&lt;Lincoln, NE___Get more from the Web.

This is for your comfort and to&lt; enhance the appearance of your flight attendants.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; On landing the stewardess said, \"Please be sure to take all your&lt;belongings. If you are going to leave anything please make sure it's&lt;something we'd like to have.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; \"There may be 50 ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out&lt;of this airplane.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; \"Thank you for flying Delta Business Express. We hope you enjoyed giving&lt;us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington National, a&lt;lone voice came over the loudspeaker: \"Whoa, big fella. WHOA!\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; A flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced: \"Please take carewhen&lt;opening the overhead compartments because, after a landing like that, sure&lt;as hell everything has shifted.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; &lt;From a Southwest Airlines employee...\"Welcome aboard Southwest FlightXX&lt;to YY. To operate your seat belt, insert the metal tab into the buckle,&lt;and pull tight. It works just like every other seat belt, and if you don't&lt;know how to operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public&lt;unsupervised.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure, masks will descend from&lt;the ceiling. Stop screaming, grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If&lt;you have a small child traveling with you, secure your mask before&lt; assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with more than one small&lt;child...pick your favorite.&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken clouds, but&lt;we'll try to have them fixed before we arrive. Thank you, and remember,&lt;nobody loves you, or your money, more than Southwest Airlines.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; \"Your seat cushions can be used for flotation, and in the event of an&lt;emergency water landing, please paddle to shore and take them with our&lt;compliments.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; \"Should the cabin lose pressure, oxygen masks will drop from the overhead&lt;area. Please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting&lt;children... or other adults acting like children.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; \"As you exit the plane, make sure to gather all of your belongings.&lt;Anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight&lt;attendants. Please do not leave children or spouses.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; \"Last one off the plane must clean it.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; And from the pilot during his welcome message: \"Delta airlines is pleased&lt;to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry.Unfortunately,&lt;none of them are on this flight!\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; Heard on Southwest Airlines just after a very hard landing in Salt Lake&lt;City: The flight attendant came on the intercom and said, \"That was quitea&lt;bump and I know what y'all are thinking. I'm here to tell you it wasn't&lt; the airline's fault, it wasn't the pilot's fault, it wasn't the flight&lt;attendant's fault ... it was the asphalt!\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo, Texas, on a&lt;particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final approach the Captainwas&lt;really having to fight it. After an extremely hard landing, the Flight&lt;Attendant said, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo. Please remain&lt;in your seats with your seat belts fastened while the Captain taxis what's&lt;left of our airplane to the gate!\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; Another flight attendant's comment on a less than perfect landing: \"Weask&lt;you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces us to the&lt;terminal.\"&lt;&lt;~~~&lt;&lt; An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he had hammered his&lt;ship into the runway really hard. The airline had a policy which required&lt;the first officer to stand at the door while the passengers exited, smile,&lt; and give them a \"Thanks for flying XYZ airline.\" He said that in light of&lt;his bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the eye,&lt;thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally everyone had&lt; gotten off except for a little old lady walking with a cane. She said,&lt;\"Sonny, mind if I ask you a question?\" \"Why no Ma'am,\" said the pilot,&lt;\"what is it?\" The little old lady asked, \"Did we land or were we shot&lt;down?\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight Attendant cameon&lt;with, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in your seats until Capt.Crash&lt;and the Crew have brought the aircraft to a screeching halt against&lt; the gate. And, once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are&lt;silenced, we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the&lt;wreckage to the terminal.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt; Part of a flight attendant's arrival announcement: \"We'd like to thank&lt;you folks for flying with us today. And, the next time you get the insane&lt;urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube, we hope&lt;you'll think of US Airways.\"&lt;&lt; ~~~&lt;&lt; A plane was taking off from Kennedy Airport. After it reached a&lt;comfortable cruising altitude, the captain made an announcement over the&lt;intercom, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Welcometo&lt;Flight Number 293, nonstop from New York to Los Angeles. The weather ahead&lt;is good and therefore we should have a smooth and uneventful flight. Now&lt;sit back and relax --- OH MY GOD!\" Silence followed and after a fewminutes,&lt;the captain came back on the intercom and said, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, Iam&lt;so sorry if I scared you earlier, but while I was talking, the flight&lt;attendant brought me a cup of coffee and spilled the hot coffee in my lap.&lt;You should see the front of my pants!\" A passenger in Coach said, \"That's&lt;nothing, he should see the back of mine!\"&lt;\n"

I will not give up on the chickens crossing the road!   I will&lt; fight for the chickens and I will not disappoint them.&lt;&lt; GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH&lt; I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road. I say&lt; give the road to the chickens and let them decide.   The government&lt; needs to let go of strangling the chickens so they can get across the&lt; road.&lt;&lt; SENATOR LIEBERMAN&lt; I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God in&lt; their own way.   Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no&lt; chicken should be denied the right to cross the road in their own&lt; way.&lt;&lt; SECRETARY CHENEY&lt; Chickens are big-time because they have wings.   They could fly if&lt; they wanted to.   Chickens don't want to cross the road.   They don't&lt; need help crossing the road.   In fact, I'm not interested in crossing&lt; the road myself.&lt;&lt; RALPH NADER&lt; Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil&lt; tiremakers.   Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays&lt; tiremakers to create the need for these roads and then lures chickens&lt; into believing there is an advantage to crossing them.   Down with the&lt; roads, up with chickens.&lt;&lt; PAT BUCHANAN&lt; To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.&lt;&lt; DR. SEUSS&lt; Did the chicken cross the road?&lt; Did he cross it with a toad?&lt; Yes! The chicken crossed the road,&lt; but why it crossed, I've not been told!&lt;&lt; ERNEST HEMINGWAY&lt; To die. In the rain.&lt;&lt; MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.&lt; I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without&lt; having their motives called into question.&lt;&lt; GRANDPA&lt; In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road. Someone&lt; told us that the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough&lt; for us.&lt;&lt; ARISTOTLE&lt; It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.&lt;&lt; KARL MARX&lt; It was a historical inevitability.&lt;&lt; SADDAM HUSSEIN&lt; This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified&lt; in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.&lt;&lt; RONALD REAGAN&lt; What chicken?&lt;&lt; CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK&lt; To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.&lt;&lt; FOX MULDER&lt; You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens&lt; have to cross before you believe it?&lt;&lt; FREUD&lt; The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the&lt; road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.&lt;&lt; BILL GATES&lt; I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads,&lt; but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your&lt; checkbook -and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.&lt;&lt; EINSTEIN&lt; Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath&lt; the chicken?&lt;&lt; BILL CLINTON&lt; I did not cross the road with THAT chicken. What do you mean by&lt; \"chicken\"? Could you define \"chicken\" please?&lt;&lt; GEORGE BUSH&lt; I don't think I should have to answer that question.&lt;&lt; LOUIS FARRAKHAN&lt; The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed&lt; the \"black man\" in order to trample him and keep him down.&lt;&lt; THE BIBLE&lt; And God came down from the heavens, and He said unto the chicken,&lt; \"Thou shalt cross the road.\" And the chicken crossed the road, and&lt; there was much rejoicing.&lt;&lt; COLONEL SANDERS&lt; I missed one?\n"

What typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes to the desk entirely at mid.   This is causing some substantial OA variances.

'I gave them aballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red markerto vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of theballot and turn it in.'\"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 222 studentspresent in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was markedwithout error.\"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down thehall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-cardballot.\"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see ifthey could find the correct bubble.'\"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correctbubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and onemarked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.\"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimateclaim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who tookany time at all could find it.'\"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subjectof protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, ofHaughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'Iwanted to vote for George Bush!'\" \n"

      "body": "\nGreat article on what it truly means to be an Auburn ManThe ties that bind Friday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times10/03/000By PHILLIP MARSHALL Times Sports Staff AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.Five straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years of trouble, despair and losing.---More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum ---'''It was defense and offense,''' offensive tackle Kendall Simmons said. '''Whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other.'''On the Friday night before last November's game against Central Florida, a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback Heath Evans. They prayed. They talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take.A bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters and reserves. It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about football. It was about matters of the heart.'''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,''' senior whip linebacker Rob Pate said. '''Since then, it's just like another thing on the itinerary. It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there. We've got five or six coaches. Coach Tuberville comes in there. People just lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.'''Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November night. Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger.It has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi State.Pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times.Pate knows about pain and even fear. A mysterious disease, now seemingly under control, threatened his senior season.'''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you for help, you know everything about a guy,''' Pate said. '''With me, it was my health. Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me. We said a prayer together. Man, I was crying.'''It's like that every weekend. Somebody on this team is suffering through something. They share it. When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.'''On the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season. Tuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school.'''I've never been around a team this close,''' Tuberville said. '''They get along. We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better.'''It's just a special group. They enjoy being around each other and understand what it's going to take for us to win.'''The change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.'''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little group, things aren't going to work,''' Simmons said. '''If you have trust in your teammates, you can build a good team. Right now, we've got that going.'''It starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college football. They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 19997. Then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.They revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting. They take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.No one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard. He went from starter to third team in 19998, then won his job back in 1999 when hardly anyone thought he could.Today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.'''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say 'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' ''' Leard said. '''No one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise. Everybody just wants to win ball games. The relationships we have on this team are like brothers.'''Leard says nothing that happens can change that.'''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special seasons I've ever had in my life,''' Leard said. '''We've got people excited. We're excited. The fun is back in it for us.'''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk. There are no fingers being pointed anywhere. There are no individuals on this football team.'''Evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson. Every Friday night, Evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.'''Heath is just like that all the time,''' Pate said. '''He's a great example of somebody who lives what he talks. He's a role model, not just for younger people but for all of us.'''\n"

Several new enhancements were created to make this application more efficient.   Such as:1.   The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 message/second.2.   The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)   You can select and view a transaction without having the screen update with new deals.3.   Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates very quickly.4.   Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, etc. and it   will filter to that section.Please forward this e-mail to your groups.   If you have any questions or concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 3-4523.   We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while testing.   Also, feedback is much appreciated!Thanks,Dawn\n"

The Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side that Enron Canada and causes me about a $5000 out of balance each month.   We have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:ENA Books:   Purchase Deal 290657   for 30,390   MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0005 = $4,125,4442.50   Sale Deal 290652 for   ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.00075=   678,375.000   Total   $3,4447,067.50 Enron Canada Books:   Sale   for 20,000 MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0005=   $2,715,000.000   Sale   for   5,390 MMBTU per day at Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.   =   732,501.000   Total   $3,4447,501.000I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in SAP.   Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.0005 and the ENA purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.0005 and balance at posting.   Let me know as soon as possible.

Looks like a buy/sell where we sold to Consumers Energy in October (1,000,000 total at 5.20) and bought it back from them in November.   Both deals have 0 rates so that's not a problem.   The problem is - there's an exchange fee on both deals of $0.0725.   But it's a negative fee on the sales side and a positive fee on the purchase side.   That means I would owe them a netted amount of $145,000.   Is that right???   Should the sale side maybe be positive so the two sides net to 0 - or do we owe them this money???Also, the confirmation letter for the sales side mentions a \"spread fee\" to be paid by Seller (ENA) of $1555,000.   Could that $145,000 netted amount be a part of that?   And if so, where's the other $10,000?So many questions!!!   I have copies of the confirms if you need to see them.   Let me know...Chuck\n"

For Child Life Insurance, you will be able to see the coverage cost of $.42 per pay period.   However, the amount of coverage will reflect $0.000.   During conversion to SAP, we discovered that there was no dependent child record created, we need immediate action from youPlease respond to this email by Thursday, June 29 by 3:000 p.m. with your child's name, date of birth and social security number.   Once we have entered all dependent data in SAP your amount of coverage will reflect $10,000 per child in eHROnline.Thank you,Ginger McCainBenefits Analyst\n"

This is a commercial decision that risk has to abide by.   The OA group, specifically John Valdes has given Jim Little the deal numbers in the past that comprise this problem to eliminate repeat performances.   This deal in question began in 111/000 and since you are doing december OA I would assume this one has not yet made the list.   I suggest forwarding to Jim LIttle/John Valdes to eliminate future problems.   Thanks.PL\n"

Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this revenue in the P&amp;L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction in the current P&amp;L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe Power QP7914.2.   Please settle this with January's physical purchase.2.   Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's invoices.3.   We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in   Schedule B in the FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&amp;L limitations, we will be modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).   A financial annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).4.   The final $5550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish the goals of your email below.

      "body": "\nRuth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in Sithe's P&amp;L.1.   Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this revenue in the P&amp;L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction in the current P&amp;L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe Power QP7914.2.   Please settle this with January's physical purchase.2.   Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's invoices.3.   We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in   Schedule B in the FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&amp;L limitations, we will be modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).   A financial annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).4.   The final $5550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish the goals of your email below.

We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders (identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.   Based on these discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.   Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.   Also, please forward all report templates, required report information, and security requirements for your region.   If you are not be able to provide this information by next Tuesday, please let me know. Trader Report Web-site Requirements:1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong Wei's team)2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial4. Each person leads a region as follows: Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region Darron Giron   / West Risk Region Phillip Love   / Central Risk Region David Baumbach   / Texas Risk Region Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders6. There are several traders within each region7. Security -   All traders should have access within their own region.   Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's   respective region (or any additional regions identified).   Security requirements need to be defined and documented by   each region lead, listing the name of each person that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be identified by each region lead, with sample report templates. 9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional reports to be added in the future10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each night) and to be published with \"view only\" capabilities on   the web-site111. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and   forward I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.   Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.   Thank you for your input and support!!!Shirley McDowellProject Manager/Trader Web-site   \n"

The trades should continue to be initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.   These same procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.   The Termination Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be terminated.   Reverse trades should not be entered into.If you have any questions, please call.\n"

The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word   \"sweatshop.\" Sweatshop is not: 1) another's party's trademark, 2) the name of an   athlete, 3) blank, or 4)   profanity. I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor   of the children that made my shoes. Could you please   ship them to me immediately.

If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new   personalization please visit us again at nike.com   Thank you, NIKE iD From: \"Jonah H. Peretti\" &lt;peretti@media.mit.edu&lt;   To: \"Personalize, NIKE iD\"   &lt;nikeid_personalize@nike.com&lt; Subject: RE: Your   NIKE iD order o16468000 Dear NIKE iD, Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom   ZOOM XC USA running shoes.   Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, I disagree with the claim that my personal iD   was inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's   Dictionary, I discovered that \"sweatshop\" is in fact part of standard English, and not   slang. The word means: \"a shop or factory in which workers are employed   for long hours at low wages and   under unhealthy conditions\" and its origin dates from   1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first email. Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is \"about   freedom to choose and freedom to express who you are.\" I   share Nike's love of freedom and   personal expression. The site also says that \"If you want it done right...build it yourself.\" I was thrilled to be able to build   my own shoes, and my personal iD   was offered as a small token of appreciation for   the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I   hope that you will value my   freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to reject my order. Thank you, Jonah Peretti From: \"Personalize, NIKE iD\"   &lt;nikeid_personalize@nike.com&lt; To: \"'Jonah H.   Peretti'\" &lt;peretti@media.mit.edu&lt; Subject: RE:   Your NIKE iD order o16468000 Dear NIKE iD Customer, Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the   NIKE iD web site that \"Nike   reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 hours after it has been submitted\". In addition,   it further explains: \"While we honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of   certain professional sports teams, athletes or   celebrities that Nike does not have the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider   inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our   products. Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to   decline personal iDs that may otherwise seem unobjectionable.

      "body": "\nnot sure if you guys saw this.PLMuse: Bowden 'panicked' after Lowder told him his job in jeopardyThe Associated Press3/18/20001 MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) --- When Auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the worse in 19998, trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not be retained after the season, former university President William Muse said. When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall, he said he was essentially fired. \"Basically, Mr. Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the season, and coach Bowden basically, in my opinion, panicked when he was told that and came and negotiated out of his contract,\" Muse said. More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers ForumMuse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden, whose team was off to a 1-5 start. Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did not speak directly to him, but went through athletic director David Housel. \"That's how David and I worked,\" Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview from his Orlando home. \"We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted me to do. I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn't be enough (to save his job).\" Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15. A transcript of the meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials. Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until \"the wee hours of the morning,\" then told him that Lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and \"urged him to stay until the end of the season.\" Muse said that was \"the most celebrated case\" of Lowder taking such a direct role in athletic decisions, but \"there are many others.\" Bowden often commented that \"Mr. Lowder hired me\" and that the coach had \"regular contact\" with the powerful trustee, Muse said. Bowden said he spoke with Lowder \"weekly, if not daily\" during his first two or three seasons, but \"never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I should do it.\" Muse said Lowder did not hand-pick the coach. He said an eight-member search committee, including Lowder, voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in 19993. \"Let's just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me hired,\" said Bowden, now a television commentator with ABC. \"There's no doubt about it. Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn.\" Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden's contention that he was told his coaching fate was all but sealed. They also denied that Lowder was pulling the strings on that decision. Bowden \"always believed ... that the only way he got that job was because of Lowder's influence,\" Muse said. \"So he believed very strongly that he had to maintain that relationship.\" Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime defensive coordinator Wayne Hall. Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder's relationship is with Bowden's successor, Tommy Tuberville, but that he believes basketball coach Cliff Ellis has \"very, very frequent contact\" with the Montgomery banker. Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment. Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees' athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide \"support and input\" to the president and athletic director and that it's time to focus on positive accomplishments and \"stop bickering.\" \n"

We had a case yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal and for the hedge.   The point was incorrect and a person in logistics corrected it.   The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.

It does not seem pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing deal locations due to time constraints.
