Incorporate the revolver document   Articles 3-7 by reference that I forwarded earlier.   I think this is the easiest way. We will need to make the appropriate modifications to change for our transaction type. Laura Falk at the company should be able to provide us with whatever information we need (name of agreement, parties to, etc). She can be reached at 908-719-4242.   Since NUI must already comply with all of this for the bank, it should not be too burdensome for them.   If they push back, I have marked the specific sections that we need to include at a minimum.2. We need to delete the reference to the collateral threshold and requirement to post performance assurance in the Master.3. Do we need to do anything about the fact that in some cases we have redundant and perhaps conflicting defaults/remedies?   Or can we just state that anything we incorpoarate from the revolver document supercedes the Master, if applicable?Can you think of anything else that I am missing?Mark, please send me the updated model.Call me if you have questions.Thanks,Tanya\n"

I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's NoticeInformation (Exhibit A) to Stacy.   Stacy, upon receipt, can you pleasegenerate the final agreement? 2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 withBob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow. 3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter shouldbe addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed theConfirmation).   Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI ConfirmationNos. 31060 and 46669. 3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version ofthe Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review.As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be theGuarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make itclear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enronhad agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for theEnfolio Agreement.   I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am notsatisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limitthe scope of the Guaranty is sufficient.   I think the limitations need to beset forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If acceptable,the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit forSwap V09140.5. &lt;&lt;ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc&lt;&lt; - ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc\n"

As Rudwell suggested, in the second paragraph   Ihave included language that limits this Guaranty to the two transactionsthat we working on.   In the same vein, I have also included language (seeparagraph 17) that ensures that any other guarantees will not be cumulativewith this one.   I assume that we will do a separate guaranty to use asExhibit D to the Master Purchase Agreement.   Any questions, please call meat 908-719-42228.   &lt;&lt;ena guaranty4(redlined).doc&lt;&lt;Paul - ena guaranty4(redlined).doc\n"

We all agreed that it is better to document the deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan.   Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and lenders.   The protections   and remedies afforded by the Master track those that Enron would have under a loan document.   Enron would be in no better position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.   Additionally, I assume that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document this deal as a loan.Please let me know if you need additional information on this topic.Stacy\n"

The B &amp; J Gas and Oil deal was done on 2/10/2000 for 10,000 a month @ $2.70 for one year (March, 2000 - February 28, 20001).   The confirmation was sent in care of Bowie, Inc., another of our customers from whom he had purchased this production, and who received his revenue and did his distributions at the time.   I got another copy from Stacy Dickson, ENA attorney, last week and faxed it to Bowie to review with Cawthon.This was not paid correctly by the payables department, and was paid at the index instead of the fixed price.   We sent the deal ticket to Wade Price the day the deal was done, but it was not paid correctly.   This causes these kinds of problems.I am attaching some notes from my phone log where I had discussions with B &amp; J (Cawthon) and Bowie at the time I locked him in, as well as conversations later in March when he said he had not received his confirmation (it was sent again).

I will need to find the document.It is my understanding that, with the exception of one deal, all the deals between ENA and MSCGI are firm deals of greater than one month duration.   ENA uses the GISB for month or less firm deals and interruptible deals of any length as recommended by the Gas Industry Standards Board.   For firm deals that are longer than one month, ENA uses a master firm agreement if one exists.   If there is no master firm agreement, we send out our General Terms and Conditions with our confirmation.   That answers your question of why Ellen sent our GTC when there is a GISB in place.It appears to me that you and I need to work on getting a master firm agreement in place.

We have issued several of these, going both directions.   Jeff is familiar with the concept if you have any questions.

Most of the early termination and alternative damages provision concepts were hammered out.   A law firm (Shook &amp; Shook) volunteered to draft language for the concepts agreed to in time for next Friday's committee meeting.   There was lot of discussion of what is going on in California and how the early termination process should work.   Enron should be fine with all of the concepts except the law firm was pushing an extremely broad set off right.   I don't think that is will go cross affiliates but it will go across contracts.   We will have to see the actual words.   I will attend the next meeting most likely by phone.   Hope things are going well.   See you in 13 days.Stacy\n"

I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 2000.   Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.   Also, will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?Thanks,CW3-75333A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.   The Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination Date.The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 interconnect.   The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR   Pipeline Company pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.   The reductions caused by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas.   In the event that the volumes scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may designate a secondary firm delivery location.The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.\n"
