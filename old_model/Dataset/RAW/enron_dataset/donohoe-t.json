Also how fast does this machine get to.   This machine has a 10 year warrenty.   Who will service this in Texas and If for any reason treadmill by net ceases to exist, what are the conditions of my warrenty.On the preset programs can I just say I want to run X distance whether it is a hill workout, time or what ever?What is the maximum amount of time a workout can be programmed to?Are there only 10 segments even in a user defined program?   If I wanted 20 intervals in an interval workout is that possible?   If I wanted to run for an hour, does each segment have to be 6 minutes?Tom Donohoe\n"
