Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no idea how to respond to.   And Anne...well I can't even explain that.   Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.   Nothing really happened.   All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you spell his name).   It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.   I haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment that needs to be made on last day P&amp;L.   I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't know.   Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.   Hope you enjoyed your trip.Robin\n"

I got to see the US women's basketball team play Australia for the gold medal.   The crowd was soo wild...that is until we won.   And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.   The whole first week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.   And the second week I spent touring all the beaches that I could find.   Oh, here's a funny story for you.   Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, muscular sufers, right?   So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters one day.   These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 80-1000 people.   As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people on the cruise.   Here's the fun part...80 of the 85 people were from a WWII veterans reunion!!!   I was on a boat full of grandpa's.   Actually it was pretty funny.   This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the war.   Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war.   He said, \"Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very well so I left.\"   He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece where he joined the Greek reserve forces.   Because he fought with Greece in the war he's now a Greek citizen.   Then after the war he and some friends bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.   When they ran out of money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then they'd start again.   I hope one day I have stories even half that interesting!!!   But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out with old people!!!   How's everything going at your house?   What's up with this election?   That's all anyone's talking about around here.   Talk to ya later,Robin\n"

      "body": "\nDavid,Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.   1)   Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the positions can be pulled into the benchmark.   2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.   3)   GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.   If one of your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books your book will not   be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.   This process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.   4)   I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle.   These files must then be loaded into GRMS.4)   I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.   5)   The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.   The more books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.   6)   When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends that book to the back of the GRMS que.   This means that the entire process must be started over.7)   Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS position.8)   If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact the GRMS support team.   Since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.   9)   I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone with GRMS support because I need access to   the information that is currently in the bench.   10)   Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down.   Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen it. If you have any more questions let me know.Robinx57478\n"

It is my understanding that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled   incorrectly.

Her explanation is as follows:This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination.   Therefore, the total origination as per the \"origination\" tab will NOT equal the origination as per the \"report\" tab. Robin should add in the translation gains/losses to get it to reconcile. I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never again be the same.Please call if you have any questions,Nicole \n"
      ],
      "body": "\nGabriel,I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the Canadian origination variance.   You may already be aware, but on the Orig Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.   However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate applied is the average rate for the month.   Therefore these values will never be the same.   Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada on Monday.   Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.   Thanks,RobinPS The Bench by trader tied out for the 23rd.   I'll be in a little early tomorrow to tie it out for the 24th.   Bye.---"

It is our understanding that the morning VaR report regarding Canada represents how we are capturing positions right now.   We are currently decomposing/reconstructing Disturnal's book to capture by region code (overall positions would remain the same).   This would impact Disturnal positions which will be moved to either McKay or Lambie.   From our side we are waiting on   the   IT resolution...   We have set a deadline of the last week in November to get this in motion.   On Monday, Bilal will give you a detail breakout of the deadline for Canada.Regarding the the Canadian P&amp;L report, I left a message for Gillis to get the numbers out there.Additionally, last week we resolved the Canadian derived curve problem (derived curves were improperly mapped and position was not be captured...)   We re-ran VaR and the e-mail below summarizes the breakout.   Overall, desk VaR decreased because Canadian VaR increased (hedges out portfilio).Hope this gives you an idea of our progress.FrankPS. We will be moving Enovate out of Hunter Shively's VaR and give it is own place on the bench.

We announced today that we are discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and distribution partners.We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.   We rolled out the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service we created.However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new on-demand service.   Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated basis.   We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment on-demand independently.We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for delivering their content over the Enron platform.   We remain very positive about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you apprised of our progress.\n"

SandyHopefully no food list will be unhappy with thisA CHANGE IN PLANSMartha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling youin advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I'vemade a few small changes:Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After atrial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaminglunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china orcrystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyonewillget a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using theplastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that Ipromised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decorationhand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it isa turkey.We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you whileyouwait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have maderegarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please rememberthatmost of these comments were made at 5:000 AM upon discovering that the turkeywas still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children'srecital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children shouldmention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribaldrumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignorethem. They are lying.We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the startof our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We'vealsodecided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit ofharmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separateroom. Next door.Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey infrontof a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at ourdinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.I stress \"private\" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter thekitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check onmy progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands toreason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choicebetween 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving thetraditionalpumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You willstill have a choice: take it or leave it.Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probablywon't come next year either.I am thankful.Source: \"Today's Woman\" magazine, Barbara A Tyler.[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]--- eGroups Sponsor ---~-~&lt;eGroups eLertsIt's Easy.

If you&lt; are able to go to the doctor, you are able to come&lt; to work.&lt;&lt; Surgery:&lt;&lt; Operations are now banned. As long as you are an&lt; employee here, you need all&lt; your organs. You should not consider removing&lt; anything. We hired you intact.&lt; To have something removed constitutes a breach of&lt; employment.&lt;&lt; Bereavement Leave:&lt;&lt; This is no excuse for missing work. There is nothing&lt; you can do for dead&lt; friends, relatives, or co-workers. Every effort&lt; should be made to have&lt; non-employees attend to the arrangements. In rare&lt; cases, where employee&lt; involvement is necessary, the funeral should be&lt; scheduled in the late&lt; afternoon. We will be glad to allow you to work&lt; through your lunch hour and&lt; subsequently leave 1 hour early, provided your share&lt; of the work is enough&lt; to keep the job going in your absence.&lt;&lt; Your Own Death:&lt;&lt; This will be accepted as an approved excuse.&lt; However, we do require at least&lt; 2 weeks advance notice, as it is your duty to train&lt; your replacement.&lt;&lt; Rest Room Use:&lt;&lt; Entirely too much time is being spent in the&lt; restrooms. Therefore, in the&lt; future all employees will follow the practice of&lt; going in alphabetical&lt; order. For instance, those whose names begin with&lt; 'A' will go from 8:000 to&lt; 8:10, employees whose names begin with 'B' will go&lt; from 8:10 to 8:20, and so&lt; on. If you're unable to go at your time,&lt; it will be necessary to wait until the next day when&lt; your time comes again.&lt; In extreme emergencies, employees may swap their&lt; time with another&lt; co-worker. However, both employee supervisors must&lt; approve this exchange in&lt; writing. In addition, there is now a strict 3 minute&lt; time limit in the&lt; stalls. At the end of 3 minutes, an alarm will&lt; sound,&lt; the toilet paper roll will retract, and the stall&lt; door will&lt; open.&lt;&lt; Paycheck Guide:&lt;&lt; The following guide has been prepared to help our&lt; employees better&lt; understand their paychecks.&lt;&lt; Example: Gross pay $1,222.02&lt;&lt; Income tax 2444.40&lt; Outcome tax 45.21&lt; State tax 111.61&lt; Interstate tax 61.10&lt; County tax 6.111&lt; City tax 12.222&lt; Rural tax 4.444&lt; Back tax 1.111&lt; Front tax 1.16&lt; Side tax 1.61&lt; Up tax 2.222&lt; Tic-tacs 1.98&lt; Thumbtacks 3.93&lt; Carpet tacks .98&lt; Stadium tax .69&lt; Flat tax 8.32&lt; Surtax 3.46&lt; Corporate tax 2.60&lt; Parking fee 5.000&lt; FICA 81.888&lt; TGIF fund 9.95&lt; Life insurance 5.85&lt; Health insurance 16.23&lt; Dental insurance 4.50&lt; Mental insurance 4.333&lt; Reassurance .111&lt; Disability 2.50&lt; Ability .25&lt; Liability 3.41&lt; Unreliability 10.999&lt; Coffee 6.85&lt; Coffee cups 666.51&lt; Floor rental 6.85&lt; Chair rental .32&lt; Desk rental 4.32&lt; Union dues 5.85&lt; Union don'ts 3.777&lt; Cash advance .69&lt; Cash retreats 121.35&lt; Overtime 1.26&lt; Undertime 54.83&lt; Eastern time 9.000&lt; Central time 8.000&lt; Mountain time 7.000&lt; Pacific time 6.000&lt; Oxygen 10.02&lt; Water 16.54&lt; Heat 51.42&lt; Cool air 26.83&lt; Hot air 20.000&lt; Miscellaneous 1113.29&lt; Various 8.01&lt;&lt;&lt; Net Pay $0.12&lt;&lt; Thank you for your loyalty to our company.

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.   Please take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.   For instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you show a position of long 241 contracts.

      "body": "\n&lt;&lt; &lt; Lesson Number One &lt;   *** &lt;   A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. &lt;   A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, \"Can I also sit like you &lt;   and do nothing all day long?\" The crow answered: \"Sure, why not.\" So, the &lt;   rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. All of a sudden, &lt;   a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. &lt; &lt;   Management Lesson: To be sitting and doing nothing, &lt;   you must be sitting very, very high up. &lt; &lt;   Lesson Number Two &lt;   *** &lt;   A turkey was chatting with a bull. &lt; &lt;   \"I would love to be able to get to the top of that &lt;   tree,\" sighed the turkey, \"but I haven't got the energy. &lt; &lt;   \"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my &lt;   droppings?\" replied the bull. \"They're packed with nutrients.\" &lt; &lt;   The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that &lt;   it actually gave him enough strength to reach the first &lt;   branch of the tree. &lt; &lt;   The next day, after eating some more dung, he &lt;   reached the second branch. &lt;   Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly &lt;   perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, &lt; who &lt;   shot the turkey out of the tree. &lt; &lt;   Management Lesson: Bullshit might get you to the &lt;   top, but it won't keep you there. &lt; &lt;   Lesson Number Three &lt;   *** &lt;   When the body was first made, all the parts wanted &lt;   to be Boss. &lt; The brain said, \"I should be Boss because I control the whole body's &lt;   responses and functions.\" &lt; &lt;   The feet said, \"We should be Boss as we carry the brain about   and &lt;   get him to where he wants to go.\" &lt; &lt;   The hands said, \"We should be the   Boss because we do all the work &lt;   and earn all the money.\" &lt; &lt;   And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs &lt;   and the eyes until finally the asshole spoke up. All the parts laughed &lt;   at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. So the asshole went on &lt;   strike, blocked itself up and refused to work. Within a short time the &lt; eyes &lt;   became crossed, the hands clenched, the feet twitched, the heart and &lt;   lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. Eventually they all decided &lt; that &lt;   the asshole should be the Boss, so the motion was passed. All the other &lt;   parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! &lt; &lt;   Management Lesson: You don't need brains to be a &lt;   Boss - any asshole will do. &lt; &lt;   Lesson Number Four &lt;   *** &lt;   A little bird was flying south for the winter. It &lt;   was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. &lt; While &lt;   it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the &lt;   frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how &lt; warm &lt;   it was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and &lt;   happy and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird &lt;   singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered &lt;   the bird under the pile of cow dung and promptly dug him out and ate &lt;   him! &lt; &lt;   Management Lessons: &lt; &lt;   1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is &lt;   your enemy. &lt;   2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is &lt;   your friend. &lt;   3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your &lt;   mouth shut! &lt;&lt;\n"

Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.   I'm glad to hear you got to go running.   I'm sure that was a great stress relief.   How's your knee doing by the way.   I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.   Some people just drive me nuts.   They come freaking out telling me something's wrong.   And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.   Most of the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.   They finally announced that we're selling HPL today.   It's about time that that's actually going to happen.   You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.   We'll see in a couple of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna hear the latest breaking news in my career?   If not skip the next couple of sentences.   Shannon doesn't even know this yet.   She might have if she'd quit blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk to them about me working up there for a year.   I've talked to a manager in the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really interesting.   But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying to me.   We'll see how that goes.   I'm not sure what I think about living somewhere that cold.   I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the interview, much less to live up there.   Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?   She doesn't think he's too bright.   He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.   He really is smart no matter what she tells you.   He's a super nice guy, much nicer than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).   But the best part is we really have a lot of fun together.   We're always laughing and cutting up when we're together.   He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of October when he moved to another group.   Then he came home with me for Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.   It was pretty obvious that there was more there though.   We started dating the next weekend.   It's been kind of crazy though.   Since we worked together and we had to review each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone we work with that we're dating.   So that's been pretty interesting.   No one's said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.   It really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.   Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.   I'd love to hear from you if you have time.   If not I understand.   Robin\n"

Within a month,   having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made   even   his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against   the   insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were   lost   \"in a series of small fires\".   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that   the   man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and   won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated,   nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which   it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that   it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be   considered to be an \"unacceptable fire,\" and was obligated to pay the   claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the   insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the   rare cigars he had lost in the \"fires\".   And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance   company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance   claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the   man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and   sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.000 fine.\n"

The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I must have died and that was heaven.   They were handing out boxes to people as they got of the elevators.   If they did that everyday I would be more excited to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c anything else would be too small.   I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm actually going to leave pretty soon.   Unfortunately I'll be back later.   One of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.   So it should be a nice 20 hour day today. I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need something for mom.   Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can find her some clothes.   If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!!

One of the protestors is holding a sign that has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.   It's pretty funny.   I also like the Sore Loserman signs.

I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.   I would love to get out of the building for a little while.   Some lady just asked me for directions to get off this floor...

I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.4.   I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so that the information   need only be queried once.   This was accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.   5.   I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.6.   I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that have been added to the Benchmark.   This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report to the Benchmark.7.   I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the fixed price positions.   This section is used to report the total fixed price position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.   I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.   If you would like to see them also please let me know.Thanks,Robin\n"

Because our IM traders actually trade for this month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.   For example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.

      "body": "\nI already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the same as for Houston.   Which means that the prices should be comparable, so I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should have the \"offer\" in a couple of hours.   It's a big mess.   I'll have to tell you that story later.   My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the analyst HR moron.   If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in the mood for it!!!I'll let you know what I find out.   RobinGabriel Monroy02/05/20001 01:36 PMTo: Robin Rodrigue/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Car   Well,   you are in a good position because you could sell your car but you don't necessarily have to.   In Enron terms this would be called a put option and we charge for it, so make sure you pay me premium.   The actual paperwork takes no time. It could be done in a day. Now, if your question was the time that you can actually find a potential buyer...well, that really depends on how much you want for it.   Have you decided on a   \"floor\".   In other words, decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car.   Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago.   Prices for cars vary a little   depending on the city. So see if comparable cars in Chicago are selling for less, that way, it might be a good opportunity to try to sell it here.   SInce you don't have to sell it, I would check the market very very well.   You don't need the money, and you don't need to sell it. You have the power. If you decide to advertise it,   don't mention anything about Chicago. I'll help you with research later. Gabriel\n"

Talk to ya later,Robin   Gabriel Monroy111/03/2000 12:59 PMTo: Robin Rodrigue/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: EBS   Well, We can go different routes. Do you know Brian Hoskins?   If not, I know him well. Well, he works in that group. He can tell us what it is about. The last time I talked to him, he did mention something about customers (big customers); but honestly I am not sure exactly what it is. Then what we can do is ask Ibrahim the name of his friend. We'll ask Brian if he knows him ( Brian, by the way, loves to help people. but only good people : (   and we can go from there. If not, we can just go trhough Ibrahim. Once that is done, We'll figure what to tell Gossett (ouchh) . Uppss, I do not want any oart during this stage. He will probably kill me if he knows I told you about this group.Ibrahim is leaving next week. He had told me that he was going to stay about 3 more weeks, but his new group wants him. Uppss   I feel I have SOO Much to learn. I really feel behind. There will be a lot of reading this weekend but of course I might take a break and go to the drive range if you want to go. You never responded me. Ok, ok, maybe you do not want to go. I'll go on my own and hit the ball with my tennis raquet.Anyways. who said there was no stress level here. I am getting kind of nervous because it is a little complicated.   Tell me what you think. Gabriel\n"

She's been driving my mother crazy (it's my dad's mom by the way).   She's now determined that there's something terribly wrong with her.   She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.   My dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and forth to the dr.

Other Gas Daily books either don't have prompt month positions or the delta position is zero, so you don't see it.The proposed logic change is even for the Swap deals, we only check one date condition (ref_dt &lt; eff_dt).   I don't think there will be any double counting for books like GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL after the change.Let me know what you think.Thanks,Wei\n"

Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon and then went out to eat and to a movie.   Then Sunday we went to visit some friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.   So we spent most of Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.   The dad is hilarious.   He's the type that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.   He was talking about the baby monitors they got.   He said he was going to put a message on it that said, \"Hi, Brianna.   This is your parents.   We aren't available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you.\"   Are we having Spanish class today?   RobinPS My forearms are a little sore, but that's all.

However, Sunday was   not so good. I went to IAH (airport) twice. So, that was almost like going to Austin, plus on the way back rain was very very bad (The 10:30 pm. rain).   For the second time, Alejandra's plane was delayed, but this time it was more than 5 hours delayed. She got stuck in Dallas and of course I knew once I was already at IAH.   How about you? Hey, My right shoulder is a little sore (Golf). Is your's sore? or am I just a little rusty.Gabriel \n"

No worries, there is still another game on the 20th and the Season begins Feb 27th (this one is for points. The other two are Pre-season but still very competitive because they are organized by the league).   By the 27th, maybe you will already have finished GMAT. So, I guess I should not even worry about having told Purvi right?   Well, if you finish the benchmark early, you know where to go, but don't worry. I won't be expecting you. Let me know what you hear from Laura (if that is how you spell her name).   I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess. I'll let you know what the outcome was. There is absolutely nothing to do.

      "body": "\nFrank, I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those days.   Here why.   The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of the following month.   The physical calc is simply copied each day.   On Jan. 31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.   Once Feb rolles to intramonth the \"From date\" on the calc is changed from the Jan 1 to Feb 1.   Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect on the positions.   Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR calc not the post ids.

If I hear you right, it appears it may have to do with the way post id's and books are officialized.   Thanks for your help.Robin,For whatever reason, we didn't pick up VaR for Feb intra-month on Jan 31, and on Feb 1, a lot of intra month hit.   I've been investigating, with Bharat, and RAC initially thought it had something to do with the code and that GRMS didn't roll in physical until the first of the month (I guess).   Now it seems like it may have something to do with the way Post id's/books are officialized. (I guess).

I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.   Not that I'd even be competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the special olympics...then I might stand a chance!Congrats on the job.

If you like them, I got them at a store up here for a really good price, but you probably have such places down there too. You won't become a golf junkie after you find out how much they want to actually let you play golf on one of those nice green courses. It's a little more than the driving range.Glad to hear that you're really not a vampire.My company was named one of the 1000 Best managed manufacturing companies by Industry Week. It's been a real joke around here. We're not sure what they were smoking when they made that decision. (Note the irony in using company email to say this...BTW...I have an interview with Arthur Anderson on the 8th)Paul&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;Robin.Rodrigue@enron.com&lt; 8/30/2000 8:21:45 AM &lt;&lt;&lt;You got her a $1000 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store).You did a very good job picking it out.Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.   I thought you weren't going to sendthem, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.   I'll hold themfor ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!!   I actually went tothe driving range this weekend.   I definitely think I could get hooked onthis sport.   Hopefully I won't become one of the \"golf junkies\" but I'm notsure you can avoid it.   I was watching a golf infomercial the other daythinking \"I need that!\"Well back to work.   Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?Talk to ya later,Robin\n"

A manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for him(the manager).   He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his desk when he gets here at 7:30.   Here's the best part though it takes about 30 minutes to print all these reports.   So essentially he was asking me to come in at 5:000 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 7:30.   I told the analyst to tell him, \"Not just no, but HELL NO!!!   I don't work for him, and   I have more important things to do.   If he had any questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further.\"   Funny, I didn't hear from him yesterday.

Second, I am attaching a copy of the positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.   The positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our directory.   I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position.   Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR calculation.   Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve this variance.   Thanks,Robin\n"

I have a few   questions for you.   How much did you pay for the box that was sent to you from Australia?   Why did you not take it with you? Ok, this is the story. My mom asked me if I could buy a Christmas tree,and of course, being a super duper nice son as I am, I was stupid enough to buy it. Well the box is about 63 lbs. and 57 x 14 inches . I called Continental and they said they would accept it.   Well, I am not sure about the whole thing. First, it is so big that it doesn't even fit in my car. I had to take it home with the trunk open. I'll see how I can figure this out, but I just wanted to ask you about the box from Australia. Anyways, I hope I can see you before I leave for Mexico. I probably just drop by and say bye. Of course I have not packed and still have to buy a few things. Have a nice day. I'll let you know about the whole EBS thing. Gabriel \n"

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the \"fun run\" on Thanksgiving.   I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were here right now.   You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!   He just asked someone how Chi-COG-OO was.   How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out the last)???   Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that he does.   I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.   I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.   They have a lot of American fast food chains.   The one that surprised me though was KFC...it's everywhere.   It's a lot more popular there than it is here.   I guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of lamb.   Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.   And they eat meat pies...yuck.   The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.   I think they still have a little too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in seasoning.   I saw quite a few good looking guys.   There was a lifesaver training course going on at Bondi while I was there.   That provided some great scenery!!!   But then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the speedos!!!   The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the beach!!!   I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might see and for fear he'd think I was interested.Gotta go to a meeting.RobinMike Pitre &lt;pitre@ev1.net&lt; on 111/13/2000 08:38:10 AMTo: Robin.Rodrigue@enron.comcc:   Subject: TripWow, what a trip.

First they rearranged their P&amp;L file and moved the order that the traders appear and don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the columns.   So they had McKay's P&amp;L reported in a   column that was titled Lambie.   Makes perfect sense right?   Then they call me and tell me that they need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to keep his p&amp;l in Canada.   Another fun bit of Canadian \"logic.\"And here my favorite.   I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an email I sent her on December 8.   She told me that the p&amp;l we reported for the first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 million to match was she thinks it should be!!!   She said that they adjusted the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian p&amp;l and for the originations total.   Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT stories my friend told me.

And here's the best part...Brad (new guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.   Wasn't it nice of him to call and tell us that everyone was gone?   Or at least telling the bozos leaving that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?   I told Jeff he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.   He said we'd have to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.   I told him I wanted my Happy hour on the beach in Cancun.   I searched the internet for flights and sent him an email with the flight information.   Talk to ya later,RobinPS   Have you decided where we're going for lunch?\n"

As part of your course, you get enhanced access to\r   The Princeton Review's award-winning web site. Below is some\r   important   information to help you use these services. Be sure\r   to save this email for future reference.\r   NEW TO THE WEB?\r   ---\r   If you are not too familiar with using the Web, you should\r   check   out \"Web 101\" at the HotWired site. It's a great\r   resource that'll answer just about every question you could\r   have about the Web. You can find it at:\r   http:///www.hotwired.com/web101   SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\r   ---\r   To use all of the features on the website, you'll need the\r   following:\r   SAT and GMAT students:\r   Web Browser:\r ---\r PC Users will need Internet Explorer version 5.0 and above\r or Netscape Navigator 4.7 or above.\r MAC Users will need Netscape 4.7 or above.\r JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is\r   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed\r   anything, you don't need to worry about this.\r   Finally, you=01,ll need a Flash and Acrobat enabled browser.   If\r you do not have these, you need not worry.   Simply click on the\r Requirements Check link after Logging In and clicking on the\r same link off of the Getting Started Page.   The Online check\r will allow you to download all necessary plug-ins.\r   Modem:\r ---\r 56 kbps or faster\r   Students preparing for all other tests:\r   Web Browser:\r ---\r   Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 4.0 or\r   higher. JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is\r   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed\r   anything, you don't need to worry about this. For best\r   results, we recommend using Netscape. If you need to download\r   a new web browser, you can do so at the following address:\r   http:///www.netscape.com/download/   Modem:\r ---\r   28.8 kbps or faster\r   LOGGING IN\r   ---\r   Whenever you go to the Princeton Review website\r http:///www.princetonreview.com, you should click on the \"Course\r   Students Click Here\" button that appears at the top of each\r   page. To enable your course services, simply enter your\r   username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.\r   For your records, here are the username and password you\r   selected when you registered:\r   USERNAME: robin.rodrigue@enron.com   PASSWORD: 7@hzq*hq\r   LOGGING OUT\r   ---\r   If you are using a public computer, like one in a library or\r   dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your\r   work on the website. All you have to do is click on the \"Log\r   Out\" link that appears on every page after you log in.\r   TAKING TESTS &amp; DRILLS ONLINE\r   ---\r   Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of\r   their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering\r   tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have\r   the most   up-to-date questions available that reflect the\r   current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to\r   provide detailed analysis of your performance to your\r   instructors.\r   SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,\r   look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.\r   If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions\r   or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can\r   also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques\r   you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've\r   learned.\r   GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests\r   or drills until your course starts.

I talked to Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.   I want you to know my family and I are praying for you guys.   I know everyone says this but if there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.   I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.   I've got to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.   He had a hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.   He's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be running marathons by now.   I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right now...WORK.   I think my other group members are trying to kill me this month.   We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each day.   Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month.   So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.   In fact I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this afternoon.   That is the one bonus of this split shift day.   Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.
