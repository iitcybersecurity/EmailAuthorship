I will forward this as soon as I receive it.   The event in this case is preventative maintenance.   It appears that there are stress fractures in certain of Clark's generation equipment.   GE is installing equipment to assess the problem.   The installation and removal of this equipment will involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks.   The question is:   Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?Thanks for your help,Laird\n"

        " John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron on 06/222/2000 05:49 PM --- \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources \tCanada Corp.   \tFrom:   Peter Keohane @ ECT   06/222/2000 01:05 PM Sent by: Nella Cappelletto@ECTTo: Derek Davies/CAL/ECT@ECTcc: John J Lavorato/Corp/Enron@Enron, Rob Milnthorp/CAL/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey T Hodge/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Hemstock/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Powell/CAL/ECT@ECT Subject: Alberta Power Purchase Arrangement AuctionI have considered on a preliminary basis the potential use of a limited liability subsidiary of Enron Canada Corp. for the purposes of bidding on the PPAs.   The issues and preliminary answers are in summary the following:1. It is not clear that Alberta would permit qualification of another Enron Canada entity at this point.   I believe that it would be more sellable if that Enron Canada entity was a replacement to Enron Canada as a Qualified Bidder, rather than an additional Qualified Bidder, and if that Enron Canada entity was similarly guaranteed by Enron Corp.   I need to discuss this matter further with Rob Hemstock, Alberta and Charles River.2. With respect to the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as mentioned, it is not free from doubt, but I believe that the Guarantee is only in respect of bidding on, and paying for a PPA and not for ongoing performance or payment obligations under the PPA.   In other words, the Guarantee guarantees \"Obligations\" which relate to the bidding process and not to the PPAs themselves, although there is some wording which could be viewed as including in \"Obligations\" ongoing obligations with respect to the PPAs themselves.3. With respect to limiting liability, such Enron Canada entity would limit exposure for a successfully acquired PPA to the contributed capital to such Enron Canada entity, assuming the Enron Corp. Guarantee would not extend past the bidding process as noted in paragraph 2 above, and subject to the common law relating to \"piercing the corporate veil\", which in essence means that the limited liability protection of a shareholder through a corporate entity can be looked through if the courts determine that the corporate entity was established merely for the purposes of avoiding liabilities properly attributable to the shareholder.   Although this is a difficult test to prove given the intended purposes of corporate and other limited liability entities, it is best to establish the limited liability entity in such a way that it has the greatest appearance of an operating company (for example, a separate board of directors, separate management, separate employees, separate operating agreements and leases, etc.).   As mentioned, however, it is all a matter of degree and generally speaking it is difficult to establish a case where the courts will allow the \"corporate veil\" protecting shareholders to be \"pierced\".4. With respect to capturing tax losses incurred in the limited liability entity, if Enron Canada is the sole shareholder so that there is no change of control on a winding-up into Enron Canada, Enron Canada can avail of tax losses incurred in the Enron Canada entity through a winding-up.   Obviously, however, this would mean that Enron Canada takes on the liabilities of the special purpose entity as a result of the winding-up, including the liabilities for any acquired PPA.   Otherwise, the general rule is that the tax losses, if any, would be captured inside in the Enron Canada entity and would not be available to be used against Enron Canada's taxable income.5. With respect to Project Stanley, there is really no established case authority directly on point, but the better view is that any sanction, if and when imposed on Enron Canada, would be imposed in a way that would prevent Enron Canada from indirectly avoiding the application of the sanction, such as by moving certain business operations into a special purpose entity.   In other words, if Canada or Alberta were intent on suspending or affecting Enron Canada's abilities to transact through the PPAs or otherwise in the Alberta Power Pool, it is likely that the sanction would be imposed upon Enron Canada and its affiliated entities also transacting through the Power Pool.Based upon the preliminary answers, please let me know if you want a more detailed legal opinion to consider these issues further and whether Hemstock and I should be approaching the Government to qualify a special purpose entity.Regards, Peter\n"

I have been working for ENA as Senior Specialist.   I work in Andrea Reed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.   On August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the dissolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there would be   no growth opportunities for me in this group. I was told that I should look for opportunities and growth elsewhere. After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go to EBS. In EBS I approached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larry Lawyer. Paul Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who might be looking to fill in vacant positions. Larry sent me to Ravi Thuraisingham, who was looking for someone with telecom background. Ravi talked to Jim Fallon, who was also looking for someone with telecom background. My background in Williams Communications Group, Inc., and specifically working on Fibre build business plan and related subjects, like cost study of fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim wanted to fill. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Williams Communications, went to discuss my background with Jim Fallon. In the afternoon he called and made me an offer to join EBS. I accepted the offer. He told me that the projects that I will be doing are about Fibre build.Upon receiving the offer, I went to Andrea Reed and told her about the offer and the excellent fit that this position has with my telecom background.   I told her that this position gives me great opportunity to make contribution to Enron's broadband efforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth opportunities for me in her group,   said she fully supports my transfer to EBS. She has already called Paul Racicot and told him of her support for my transfer to EBS (Please see Andrea's email below).   Jim Fallon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my transfer to EBS. They want to finally check it with you and get your support for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has been finalised, except that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your approval.   Andrea Reed fully supports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would appreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to miss this opportunity, and would like to start as soon as possible.Regards,Husnain Mirza39541---",

Bruce Power is 95% ownedby British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the twomain unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionalson the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.   This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement forthe Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in threeinstallments. A first payment of $4000 M will be made on closing subject tonormal closing adjustments. The remaining $2225 M will be paid in twoinstallments of $1112.5 M each.   Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. Thevariable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementarypayments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments areestimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 20002.   Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG includethose that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations supportservices. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtainingthe necessary licences, in the summer of 20001.   \"Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, theelectricity consumer and the shareholder\" stated Ron Osborne, OPG Presidentand CEO. \"This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilitieswhich in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace tocompetition and providing electricity consumers with choice.\" Osborne notedthat an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate onaccelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington andPickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.   Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario PowerGeneration, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companiesare committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.   \"We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company.

British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitiveprocess over the last two years. They have significant operating experienceand a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.   To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licencesfrom the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario EnergyBoard.

Thus, we can project the price for the contract and compare it to our forward curve (at AECO) to determine the best course of action:   extend or terminate.The following summarizes the comparative pricing I need.

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday,   was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming.   Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard   ---",

We've had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders.   We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this project.   It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all drill downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that add up existing position manager rows/columns).New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.   Each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the appropriate positions to show for each:Gas Daily for monthly index,Physical gas for Nymex,Physical gas for Inside Ferc,Physical gas for Mid market.Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of using official valuations.Position and P&amp;L aggregation across all gas desks.Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:Inclusion of spread options in our systems.   Ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.   Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.Valuation of Gas Daily options.A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).   TBD.Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.Ability to view change deal P&amp;L in the TDS deal ticker.   Show new deal terms, prior deal terms, and net P&amp;L affect of the change.Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.Benchmark positions in TDS.Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit and explicit position break out issues.--- Allan.PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport.   Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that point.\n"

Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting to move to level 14.   There are several problems with this move.1.   This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to support them. a.   The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk). b.   Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more cabling for the turrets.   There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling c.   AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.   The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in late December.   Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 20001.2.   This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems. a.   Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.3.   The Response Time would be affected. a.   The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA trading floors.   A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.   Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group. b.   We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.   The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.4.   There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be susceptible to power outages.I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.   Level 29 has been completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.   This floor has been built out with Trading Desk furniture as well.My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; this will save the company both money and time.   Your help is needed to convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.Thanks,Darren AdamikMgr.-Trading TechnologyEnron Net Works713-853-4764\n"

We are focused on externally launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 2000 energy credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very quickly.   The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review prior to going live.   The intent is to capture as much of the corporate credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new mediums for communication.   To this extent, any ideas that you might have for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.   This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading initiatives.   We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and customer base.\n"

She has suggested the we use Cap Gemini to help convert Daniel's systems for the Canadian business.   I have also given Beth a name of a systems guy that came recommended that would be an employee here to help translate the differences in the markets and would ultimately be the Dan Maitland of Canada to look after the product as we build the business.I think that it would be very helpful to have Daniel involved in the scoping due to his familiarity with the systems and the settlement requirements with the wires and pipes companies.   If Daniel could direct the development out of London, that would be great as well.   I heard that he did a great job on the Spanish effort.Dave Delainey and John Lavorato are supportive of building this business here and the Canadian president(Rob Milnthorp) is also keen to grow this business.   I think that we can be much more effective using the UK systems than trying to build our own from scratch.   I would rather build this without looking to the EES IT resources out of Houston, as I believe that we will be more successful importing the latest ED systems and modifying them for this market in time for market opening---just 2 months away.I really appreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to deliver another success to Enron as a whole.   I'm sure glad that I know you guys as I know that I will end up with a product that works for us.   Don't worry, I will not try any coding myself.Best regards to you both, and I hope you are staying DRY in wet old London Mark.Cheers,Dave\n"

This had been done to better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem appropriate for our activities.The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different states of development and application of business strategies.The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business experience and corresponding strategy.I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our business.

Listed below are the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) and December 13th (Associates).   Your participation in these meetings is essential.   Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.   The pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.   The PEP system is open and available for employees to select reviewers.   You have been listed as a secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts feedback.   You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.   The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system is closed.   The more information that you can secure regarding your Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated correctly at the final PRC.   If you are a new PRC Representative and are unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-92333 or Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.SupervisorsYou should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the Associates/Analysts that work in your group.   You should then consolidate this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at your business unit pre-rating meeting.   If your business unit is not conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.   Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.   You should wait to provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have been made to avoid any confusion.   All pre-ratings are subject to the final cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.   You are responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.   Keep in mind that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will ensure that the final PRC is a success.Associates/AnalystsYou are responsible for selecting your reviewers.   You should have received your logon ID and password from the PEP team.   If you have not received this, please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.   Please go into the system and select your reviewers.   Your direct supervisor may let you know how many people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your reviewers.   Remember that it is important to select a broad range of reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.   You will also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.   Be sure to take the opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you have added value to your unit.   This is your chance to be heard.   You may hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.   If you do not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.   An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and Analysts.   We encourage you to attend.   Final PRC results should be communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/000.   The feedback should be communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.   If the Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-92333 or Shelly Butler x3-4584).   Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a successful final PRC\n"

I envision a series of transition teams, organized by function, that are responsible for transferring systems, knowledge, and people from the east and west power desks up to the Calgary office.   These are my initial thoughts.   Things will obviously change as we learn more about the market rules and when we get the head of the desk in place.TradingTransition team - Tim Belden, Mike Swerzbin, Bill GreenizenHire head trader.   John L. and Tim are currently working with John Zufferli to guage interest and come to terms on relocation.   John Z. is planning a trip to Portland and Calgary as soon as he is able to fly.   Hopefully the week of September 16th.Get EOL products defined and posted.   Greenizen hopes to get this done by September 16th.Develop curves.   Currently using implied PPA bid curves.Develop position reports.Give offers to origination team.   Tim/Mike/Bill will provide prices to origination until head trader has been hired.RiskTransition team - Monica Lande and Kathy ???Kathy traveled to Portland on 9/5 and 9/6 to learn about our risk process and book deals.Book positions.   In process of entering five deals.   One for each unit, line losses for each unit, and payment for the PPA.   Will run mini book to ensure that close to zero value is created when all deals are booked and run against our curves.   Should have this done by September 8th.Drop curves.Create position reports.SchedulingTransition team - Jeff Richter, Bill Greenizen, Peggy H.Learn and define scheduling requirements in Alberta.Learn about California scheduling systems.Assess applicability of California scheduling systems to Alberta market.Hire a scheduler.Real TimeTransition team - John ForneyAssess whether we need to run real time group in Calgary.   We may be able to start with someone on days and have nights and weekends covered from Portland.   Legal issues with Portland providing service to Calgary.Assuming we want a real time person in Calgary ... hire a RT trader/analyst.   We may be able to draw from Portland's real time desk for this.FundamentalsTransition team - Tim Heizenrader and Stephan ???, and Chris WiebeWe can use the Portland fundamentals team to do much of the work before January.   We have the systems and most likely the staff to come up with the first generation of Alberta fundamentals.Train a person who will eventually be located in Calgary on West Power Fundamentals --- systems and processes.   Stephan or Chris W. may fit this bill.   Must get buy in from Heizenrader and head trader.We have a person in Houston, Sanjeev Khanna, who used to work for Enmax and now works for structuring in Houston.   He is not interested in relocating to Calgary, but would like to help us learn about the market.Should consider trying to hire industry expertise from local utility.   Derek will work on this.   Sanjeev may have some ideas here.Establish better network connections between Portland and Calgary.   Dan Dietrich.Volume ManagementTransition team - Murray O'Neil, Peggy H., Laura ScottLearn market rules for settlements.   Get 1 person from Derek's group to try to spell out the settlements formulas on both the pool side and the contract side.Compare Alberta Power Pool settlements procedures to California settlements and determine whether Volume Management system will do the job.Come up with a manual backup plan until VM system will work.Hire someone to do volume management in Calgary.   We are currently assessing whether anyone from Portland could do this job.I will be out of the office until September 16th.   We have already made plans for Bill G, Kathy, Peggy, and Laura to come to Portland to check out our systems and processes.   Shortly after I return we should be able to nail down the head trader position.   Tim Heizenrader will call Sanjeev to see if there is a role for him to play in our Fundamental Analysis effort.   It may be worth waiting until the head trader is in place to do this.I'm off to Montana for a week.   Debra Davidson will be able to get in touch with me.   She can be reached at 503-464-3820.Regards,Tim\n"

I envision a one page summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set at 1000%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.   I will derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will beidentification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I don't want to provide you with something \"half-baked\".   Is it acceptable to allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provideyou with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ? Finally, I have provided Tammy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed transactions plus a deal flow \"hot list\" .Sorry for being verbose. Please advise. Thanks,   Ed\n"

Initially by someone on the crude desk offering her a job to headtheir marketing group. Jeff Shankman followed up to encourage her to become a candidate for the job. Separately, Fred LaGrasta approached Janelle to ask ifshe would be interested in coming back to work for him in Breslau's Industrial Group. My concern is   that none of these individuals provided me the courtesy to check if it would be appropriate to discuss job opportunities with Janelle. Given that she has been in power for only   5 months and is performing a critical role in our effort to increase deal flow, I will be in a bind if I loose her. Janelle did the right thing by divulging this information. I wanted you to be aware of this.Thanks,   Ed \n"

Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including building forward curves.   He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the Northeast U.S.).   Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for Ontario.   2.   My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.   This could always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.3.   John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have no power trading responsibilities.4.   Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.   I expect us to use Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.5.   Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know the people and the technical resources available to him.If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.John\n"

However, with respect to creating a redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.   With the integration of the   6 peaker plants into our operation and the associated IT support, control area operations, plant operations, hourly trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide all the necessary tools and support personnel necessary to perform this function from Houston.   All the critical trading information would obviously be available to the Ontario office, yet they would not have to be burdened by the additional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical capabilities the Houston office has developed over the past two years.   The Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their aggressive attitude, however, rationale business decisions should still prevail.Your thoughts?---",

Depending on the complexity of the operation you will have to determine the level of industry expertise.   A good plan would be to hire a senior lead utility type and then bring on junior staff.   The quality and quantity of staff will likely be based on the value at risk and the complexity of dispatching these units. If you consider the operation critical a diesel and UPS will be required.Plasma displays run $10,000 to $15,000 per display plus any switching/av equipment.We have a PI consultant on contract that could be available for your PI project - typically $ 150.000 per hour plus travel and expenses.The above assumes that no special hardware/software is required from The IMO to dispatch these units.___I have also attached the initial PI project spreadsheet for your review and the following email for our PI order.Please issue Two Purchase Orders to:OSI Software, IncAttention: Richard CrounseFax Number 281-920-61999Enron Software Licensing Contact: Gene Diers, x36361Charge to Company Number 34K (East Power Generation - GENCO), RC 2176, Work Order S300084These purchase orders need to be issued by December 14.

They have filed for bankruptcy on August 28, 2000.   It should also be noted that our July settlement was not offset by our purchases due to an apparent oversight by the Settlements group, resulting in an additional $678,000 of credit exposure.   EES's credit exposure is still being researched but is estimated to be over $5,9000,000 of additional exposure.   We are working with EES to resolve these issues as well.As I mentioned today, Perry Gas Companies, Inc. was not approved for credit on any of these transactions and was on our Credit Watch List.   This company was not an approved counterparty and was granted a zero credit line.   We are still trying to get the list of trades and traders for the July transactions.Let me know if you have any questions.Bill\n"

How can we be the most Innovative Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.   Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because they are here until 8:30-9:000 every night and 4:000 pm on \"holidays\".   This whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt with accordingly.Please advise.   Thank you.---",

The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months now).   Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday (Enron holiday).   We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and should have been completely done by 111:30.   However, the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try.   We were able to leave by 4:000.   The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day.   This could have a financial impact on our company.   Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem.Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.   I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server.   Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENA's business process.   I think they need to move to another server.Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.   Thank You.Kristin Albrecht3-4763---",

We run one of our three east power calcs on this machine (the second largest one).   Since an acceptable solution for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken away from us.   The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.   We usually start calcing at about 4:000.   The calc time is now running at 1.5 hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful completion.   So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at 4:30.Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the last 3 weeks.   This is not acceptable.We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable.   I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights.   I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems. I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing between different IT groups.Thanks.Kristin Albrecht---",

I think that I have most of it right.   If there is anything wrong or missing please let me know.   Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of Enron.Regards,TimNew Cap SpecificsOn 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a new price cap methodology.The new methodology will become effective 111/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as can be implemented.   CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to achieve that start date.   They have not yet indicated what an achievable date might be.The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the following heat rate table:   Load Level   Heat Rate   4.000 Gas Example Cap   &lt;25 GW   10,7775   $43.10   25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70   30GW to 35 GW   17,2225   $68.90   35GW to 40 GW   27,2225   $108.90   &lt;40 GW   $250/MWh   $250/MWhCaps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior to the beginning of each calendar month.   Based on the ISO's two day-ahead system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior to the hour of delivery.FERC ContextFERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 111/15/2000.The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid cap rather than a sales cap.   FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.   FERC has to rule on the filing by 111/18/2000.   (Note that this is 3 days after their authority expires)FERC will release its proposed order on 111/1/2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.   We don't know what they will find or what they will propose.The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will likely issue a final order.   FERC will be accepting oral comments on 111/9/2000 in Washington.   Enron still has to determine who will provide oral comments.Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into effect.   How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.Impact of Price CapsThe attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at different gas price levels.   We think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.   It is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the cap.   The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.   For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January through September.   Each month has approximately 4000 hours.   for January through September, we took approximately 8000 observations for each month (4000 from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual observations.We created a peak table and an off-peak table.   The table shows the calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month.   This value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).   While any given hour could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value!The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 NYMEX) forward prices.   The yellow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.\n"

This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage facility.   One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $1000,000 per year in order to keep the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.   (Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders those are VERY critical seconds).Regards,Julie   :-)\n"

This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application specialist from SUN.   This has been authorized and the additional resource is scheduled to be on site next week.   I also have my resources and the UNIX administrators working along side the Sun resources.As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side of the business.   I met with Sally Beck's controllers yesterday and we are putting a plan in place.   The increased trading volumes have seriously impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to correct the issues.These problems have not gone unnoticed.   I assure you that IT has been very diligent in following through on these problems.   We're investing heavily in additional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources at an average of 5 - 8 per week.

How can we be the most Innovative Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.   Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because they are here until 8:30-9:000 every night and 4:000 pm on \"holidays\".   This whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt with accordingly.Please advise.   Thank you.---",

The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months now).   Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday (Enron holiday).   We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and should have been completely done by 111:30.   However, the calc crashed six times and finally completed on the seventh try.   We were able to leave by 4:000.   The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next business day.   This could have a financial impact on our company.   Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem.Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.   I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing business that is using that server.   Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENA's business process.   I think they need to move to another server.Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.   Thank You.Kristin Albrecht3-4763---",

We run one of our three east power calcs on this machine (the second largest one).   Since an acceptable solution for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken away from us.   The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.   We usually start calcing at about 4:000.   The calc time is now running at 1.5 hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful completion.   So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at 4:30.Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the last 3 weeks.   This is not acceptable.We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable.   I feel like we have been very patient at the expense of many late nights.   I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems. I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing between different IT groups.Thanks.Kristin Albrecht---",

If you disagree please write me back.I moved from our Houston office in 19994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named President of the Canadian operation.   We went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.   It was absolutely awesome.   I had the time of my life.   We built the business with very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's bottom line.   These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.   So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help build revolutionary new businesses.What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.   The opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.   These businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.   You can't put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities.   Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to figure out what the Fed is going to do.   It has much more complexity, and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it...get down here! ... we need you!John's callout quoteEnron's not a place where you can hide.   If you can't get it done you won't fit in.   But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.\n"

The system brought through totally inaccurate information on a few books.   (Positions,   value,   etc.)   Luckily, these errors were all caught last night,   but if a less experienced person had been on those books,   it could have been a disaster.

Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).3.   With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the \"Cross Commodity Trading Group\" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only employee).   This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading groups staying within their VAR limits).   However, I do see the need for a true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability trades accross the commodities that we trade.   This structure may help to start us down this path.Please let me know what you think.John\n"

Call me if you have any questions about the model or changes you wouldlike to see.Todd Hargarten416-982-22286(See attached file: Client.xls) - Client.xls\n"

I   have been working with EOTT Energy Corporation for thelast   four   months on a temporary basis on a project involving setting up aprofit/loss   report   for   the   various regions within the United States forEOTT's   crude   oil trading and marketing business.   Previously, I worked inthe   energy   industry   for   over   two   years   in   trading, risk management,structured   products   and   marketing of electricity and natural gas for thewestern   United   States.   Additionally,   I   was   actively   involved in thephysical   markets   and   gained   a strong understanding of the western grid.Furthermore,   I am an expert in options trading and have a strong knowledgeof the commodity and financial markets.   Moreover, I have also traded NYMEXnatural   gas   futures,   options   on futures, forward contracts for physicalpower   and   options   in   SERC, SPP, MAAC, MAIN, ECAR and ERCOT.   Finally, Ihave   had   experience   setting   up/operating   market   simulation models andmaintaining the underlying databases for fixed income securities.   Prior toentering the energy markets, I worked as the senior trader/risk manager forMellon   Mortgage   Company   in   Houston,   Texas.   At   Mellon,   I positivelyaffected   the   bottom   line   performance   of the company for over two yearsthrough   strategic   trading   and   hedging of mortgage backed securities.   Ireceived the Premier Achievement Award from the Chief Executive Officer foroutstanding   financial   performance   and   the   Employee   Choice   Award fromco-workers for my tenacity and diligence in work.   My expertise with listedfutures   and   options   on   futures,   OTC   options and swaps, as well as theability   to   positively   affect   the   bottom   line could definitely make animpact   with   your   team.   In addition, my competitive and entrepreneurialpersonality   allows   me to constantly look for profitable solutions or costeffective ways of managing risk.As   you   will   note   from   the   enclosed   resume, I managed the trading andhedging   of   the   interest   rate risk on mortgage loans for Mellon MortgageCompany.   The   interest   rate risk was managed by use of forward sales andpurchases   of   mortgage backed securities, put and call options on mortgagebacked securities, and 10 year CMT Index floors.   In addition,   futures andoptions on futures on U.S. Government Treasury notes and bonds were used atthe   appropriate   time   taking into account the basis between mortgages andtreasuries.   Previously,   I worked for The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japanin   New York as a proprietary trader in fixed income. Earlier, I worked forGarvin   Guybutler   Corporation,   a   major   international   money and depositbroker.   Primary   responsibilities   at   Garvin   included   uncovering   andexecuting   arbitrage EuroDeposit transactions in order to enhance placementyields   and   reduce   borrowing   costs   relative   to   Eurodollar   deposittransactions   of   similar   maturities.   In addition, I was involved in thebrokering   of   Term   Federal   Funds,   EuroDollar   deposits,   EuroCurrencydeposits, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements.It   would be my pleasure to discuss these qualifications with you and learnmore   about   positions   in   natural   gas   trading with Enron North America.Please contact me so we can talk about possible opportunities.Thank you,Rick J.
