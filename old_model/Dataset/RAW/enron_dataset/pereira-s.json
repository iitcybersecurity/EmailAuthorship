We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 deadline.   Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 7000,000 Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.   The project calls for about 59 miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of about $94,343,7000.As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for authority to charge negotiated rates.   Petal also requested approval of certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of our intervention.   The certificate application is 635 pages, not including another 7778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.\n"

Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.000 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.000.If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. The Saturn Ring   that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 20001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060   with any questions. (You must enter &amp; exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell &amp; Smith.)\n"

Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also took the initiative to move over to Microsoft Outlook2000, for our messaging client.   This will provide more flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts --- not to mention an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices. I would like to start the migration process first with visiting with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more than 10-15min.   Profiling can begin as early as tomorrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of you: *** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.   Being that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no more than a few days. *** Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.Thank you,Kacee DowneyDeployment Managerx555641281-541-9272 cell\n"

Duties would begin mid morning with setup and continue until 2:30 or 3:000   with cleanup. ?During F&amp; F hours from 111:000 - 3:000 her helper would need to   help run the booth, hanging the pinatas from the tree, collecting tickets,   etc. ?There are also several parent volunteer hourly slots that have not been   filled - one slot from 1:000 - 2:000 and two slots from 2:000- 3:000. Could any of you help with any of this? ?If so, please email me and I will   let her know. Thanks! Margaret Pierce Room Parent\n"

We could arriveSunday   see Corcovado, P?o de A?ucar, Tijuca rainforrest, and a few outlyingbeaches.   Then late Tuesday afternoon the 10th you and Renato could fly outfor Foz.   Depending on the flight schedules you may have to wait until earlyWednesday morning the 111th. I think that Tuesday would be better so you'renot feeling rushed, but we'll see what flight times are offered.   Spend twonights at Foz and fly into SP late Thursday evening the 12th.   Hang aroundthe house on Friday, put your suitcases together and head back for Houstonthat evening.   Too bad you're not able to spend more time here, but given what time youhave I think you'll be seeing the two most interesting places in Brazil. Allof the others, Amazon, Pantanal, Bahia all take so much travel time to getthere that it's not even really worth the attempt to see them.   If you dodecide on Foz, don't mess with packing your coats, it'll be easier to borrowsome of ours.   The travel agent is looking at fares, etc. so I'll let you know what shefinds.I'll be in touch...Jan\n"

Glad to hear that you're   interested in the Foz.? I think it would be a great trip for you to take,   although I'm confused about the dates of the 4th and 5th.? Don't forget,   the six of us will be in Ilha de Comandatuba for the week of June 30 til July   7th.? If we stick to the original schedule we would all be getting into   S?o Paulo Saturday the 7th.? The driver would pick up you and Renato   and you guys would arrive at the house a few hours before us.?   ??? What could easily work   is for all of us to go to Rio on Sunday the 8th, spend a few days there and   then, you and Renato could fly directly to Foz from Rio and the kids and I would   drive back to s?o Paulo.? You guys could then fly into S?o   Paulo from Foz.??? The hotel I would suggest at   the Foz is the Cataratas.? It's located within walking distance of the   falls on the Brazil side and set inside the national reserve forrest with all   kinds of walking trails.? They might offer a service to get to the   Argentina side of the falls, I'll check into that.? If not you just take a   taxi or car service.? ??? When we went we stayed at   Mabu which had all of these thermal swimming pools, large grounds, pond   etc.? It was more for the kids to enjoy.? Our kids liked the falls but   after walking on one side of it had no interest for the other...too much   walking.? It would be a nice get-away for the two of you I   think.??? I'll check into flights and   hotels today and let you know what I find out.? I haven't heard much about   Hotel Conial Igua?a, I'll see what I can find on it here.??? I'll be in touch   soon...JanPS? Let Renato know that just finished   having a workout room built at the house.? Also, he can enjoy some great   running in front of the beach while you're in Rio ---??? so hopefully he   won't suffer too much withdrawal !...have a good   one\n"

It was my job to resolve all imbalance discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.   As I was working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the only imbalance we discussed.   I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance sometime in september.   Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until several months later.Susan W Pereira@ECT111/14/2000 03:01 PMTo: Leslie Robinson/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Stingray/LRC imbalanceLeslie-When did we agree with El Paso/Stingray on the 111,973 dth owed to Stingray?   Have they been asking for this gas back since February?   Did you approach them first on settling this?   The reason I'm asking these questions is that HPL had a big imbalance due them from an El Paso operated line in Texas.   HPL had been asking for the gas back from the beginning and El Paso finally paid them back in kind this month.   I do not want to pay Stingray back in kind.   I want to pay them Feb. 2000 IF NGPL-LA.Thanks,Susan\n"

I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to forward my email address to her.   If I don't hear back from you today, I will probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.   Maybe I can clarify a few issues with her.   As for Cindy Colvin's \"presentation,\" I've spoken with Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.   In the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.   Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.   I know we will need to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.Thanks,SusanP.S.-Please email me back today at our home email address :   pereira@houston.rr.com.   I'm leaving early for a doctor appt.\n"

We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later I guess.Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the next Fri. night flight (13th).   I think we've decided not to go to Foz do Iguacu, since we have so little time.   Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a few days.   Can we all go together and drive.   Maybe you could get hotel reservations there?Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.   The kids can't wait.Susan\n"

Kali liked her birthday gifts.   Believe it or not, we didn't already have the World Pup movie. We had rented it back in February and the kids liked it.I'm not sure if you got my last email before we left on vacation, but I was wondering what your travel schedule was in June.   When will you be arriving, when will you be returning (Kali has warmed up to the idea of travelling without us on the plane), etc.   The earliest we could leave for Brazil would be the evening of Friday, July 6.   We would probably need to return to Houston by July 14.   Let me know how that sounds.   Also, if we need to reschedule for another time until you get things straight for your mother, let me know.   That's certainly more important.Talk to you soon...Susan\n"
