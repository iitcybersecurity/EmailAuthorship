As I indicated to Rod yesterday, I have been informed that the premiums that were paid this year were $15,000,000 and given the claims submitted at $43,000,000, Corp is looking for a way to mitigate anticipated rising premium costs.   They are looking very hard at Hawkin's Audit Program to help them out.   As this list indicates, International assets should bear the brunt of future costs.   The Transwestern train derailment will be about $7000,000 ($2000k for repair and $5000k for buisness interruption), both of which will ulitmately be reimbursed by the railroad.\n"

Since such transaction would need to be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors (depending upon the structure) the expected returns will not justify the balance sheet impact on Northern Border Partners if this entity were to function as lessor.   Furthermore, I have assumed that this conclusion also holds true from Enron's perspective given their strategy of reserving balance sheet capacity for higher return projects.Since the bid parameters do not specify a lease requirement, Trailblazer may already have funding in place.   If not, EAMR could insert language in the bid that they or their designee would arrange lease financing for the project upon selection of EAMR as the winning bidder.   At that point, we would work with commercial banks or major leasing companies to develop a cost-effective financing transaction.I hope this addresses your questions regarding the feasibility of such a transaction, but please call me at x7843 in Omaha if you wish to discuss further.   Good luck with your bid!\n"

Generally, I don't see the FERC having any problem with mechanical, electrical, air-conditioning types of services.   However; there are 2 specific concerns that arise with respect to the described arrangement under the FERC's marketing affiliate standards of conduct:1. Records --- FERC has ruled that giving a marketing affiliate \"access\" to transportation and shipper records (including something as simple as file room access) is deemed to be impermissibly sharing the information with a marketing affiliate in violation of the standards. Thus, it seems to me that EES will explicitly not be able to perform any records management function for NNG, TW or NBPL.2. Billing -   FERC scrutinizes intercompany charges carefully.   In a recent Kinder-Morgan consent order, the FERC used payroll and intercompany charge records to make the case that the pipeline and marketing affiliate did not operate separately.   It would be helpful if any EES facility management charges/allocations come from Enron Facility Services (not EES) ---   leaving us room to argue that the facility management subsidiary involves separate functions and staff than the EES subsidiary that is a marketing affiliate. \t   From:   Steve Kean &amp; Bill Donovan   111/14/2000 06:36 PM\t Sent by:\tEnron AnnouncementsTo:\tAll Enron Houstoncc:\t Subject:\tReorganization of Houston and Omaha Facilities Management ResponsibilitiesResponsibility   for daily operations of building support services in the Enron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will be transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.   The areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical, electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;   housekeeping;   food, copier, and records services.This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron's Business Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to their commercial customers.   EPSC staff having administrative responsibility for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of EES's Global Energy Services group led by Daniel Leff, President and CEO.EPSC is responsible for Enron's internal real estate and office development needs, including leasing, space allocations and facility planning, project and construction management, furniture systems, and office relocation.   EPSC, in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department, reporting to Bill Donovan, Vice President, Corporate Administrative Services.This alignment of responsibilities offers the opportunity for EPSC to focus resources on effective utilization of our existing office space assets and managing the development of Houston's new Enron Center Campus project.&lt;Embedded StdOleLink&lt;\n"

However,   the 20001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan McCarty's executive RC budget.

The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the year.

Can we work with Dave Waymire here in Omaha???Also,   there was an article in   this past   Sunday's World Herald that   FASB has reversed its position on merger accounting and will not require firms to amortize Goodwill   over time and   write it off against current income of a merged company.   In addition, the new plan would eliminate the   \"pooling of interest\"   restrictions and allow merged companies to sell off unwanted assets prior to the two year waing period now required.   I'm not sure if this revision would be applicable to mergers which occurred before this FASB revision or not.   Do you have any insights on this???Thank You.Mike McGowan---"

I believe everyone is now comfortable with our purchase decision.In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &amp;Touche and Ernst &amp; Young.   These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have audited this application and have actually participated in numerous implementations.   Ernst &amp; Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable Resources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for Tractabel.   After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit concerns.   Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year maintenance.   This cost does represent a very limited implementation with only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no electronic interfaces or data conversion.   The assumption is that initially the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as well.   The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $1000,000/year.   We did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original cost of the Revenue Management RAROC.   Let me know if you have any other questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to completing the contract.   We are hoping to get this signed and the project underway next week.   Thanks.\n"

A meeting to discuss this issue and how Operations will determine these fees, is scheduled for Monday, December 18, on your calendar.   Your input is very important at this meeting.Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.   NBPL has been asked to renegotiate fees (PGL&amp;C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1 year (Harvest States).   NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).   We need to agree on a decision from both a business and an operations perspective.   Currently, we have estimated operating fees at interconnects where we charge a fee and charge a standard monthly fee of $2,000 per month with the exception of two interconnects.   With the tariff changes, operating fees will not automatically be recovered in the future.   How are these operating fees going to be tracked and charged?   Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers the same fee?   Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a cost of doing business?   These questions need to be answered at the meeting.Thanks!\n"

We are definitely going to change this now.In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).   In that case, a small amount of O&amp;M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.   In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the amounts be left at NBPL.   The main reasons are accounting ease, avoidance of fiduciary issues, and customer relations.Rod Hayslett12/06/2000 10:05 AMTo: Jerry Peters/NPNG/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Re: O&amp;M Fees at InterconnectsHow have you guys been doing this?

I would prefer that we have shipped the computers before there is any announcement.   Do you have an exact date?   If your announcement is before we actually ship the computers, which hopefully will be this week, then I would just say something like NALMP has established a new relationship with Enron Transportation Services, the pipeline subsidiary of the Enron Corporation.   If your announcement is after we ship then I would feel more comfortable mentioning some of the details.Let me know what you think.MichaelMmvmunson@aol.com on 12/111/2000 09:29:27 PMTo: Michael.Ratner@enron.com (Michael Ratner)cc:   Subject: announcement re: computers Michael--- ???At this time of year, I usually send out an update to NALMP supporters and donors about what we have been up to in the past year and what lies ahead. ?Do you think that I can mention this pending project with Enron? ???Mary\n"

I'm sure you know that we have been assured that everything was fixed, but it appears there is still quite a problem in your pay---or some kind of misunderstanding.JIM CARLSON---   I agree with Mike Woolery in him memo below, that we need to have a knowledgable person perform an audit of Mike's entire payroll from the beginning of the SAP payroll system initiation.   Who do I talk to to get this rolling.   Once the audit is complete, we need to sit down with Mike W. and other concerned Shift Operators to review findings and proposed remedial actions to eliminate this type of thing in the future.   I know that Terriann has met with knowledgable SAP administrators and changes in the payroll process have been initiated recently that, hopefully, should address future problems of this nature.
