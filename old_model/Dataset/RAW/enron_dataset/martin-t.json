It is not a VPP deal.   It is a financial deal only, between an Enron company called Bob West Treasury and EEX.   It is a financial deal only - no physical vols.In a completely separate financial hedge, EEX had hedged some gas vols with Fred Lagrasta [ENA].   Last December, EEX called wanting to EFP some of these vols.   This is completely between Fred/ENA and EEX.   It has nothing to do with our pre-pay.David/Tom, I would say the decision if this deal stays with you or goes to AEP is up to Fred.   I just spoke with Fred and he said that they did just one EFP with EEX - some south Texas [Thompsonville] vols.   He is uncertain as to the term, but off the top of his head, he thought it was for 2 or 3 years.   He said it didn't matter to him if we kept this EFP or if it went to AEP, as long as we were paid - it is way in the money.   This EFP should be in Tom's book and if it is decided to go to AEP, then this needs to be reflected in the final purchase price to AEP, since it is in the money.   BOTTOM LINE:   it doesn't matter to Fred, as long as we are paid for this.If you have any questions re this EFP, please discuss with Fred.Joan   ---Original Message---From: \tBaumbach, David   Sent:\tMonday, March 26, 20001 9:47 AMTo:\tBoyt, EricCc:\tJoan Quick/HOU/ECT@ENRONSubject:\tRe: EEXJust to confirm ... the gas we are recieving at various fixed prices on deal N60753.3 is going to AEP.

They are asking now to a proposal of minimum 5 years, and upto 12 if we can make it. So they will be taking the risk of not having a fuel supply that matches de 25 year Power Purchase Agreement.2.- The Points of Sale will be in the U.S. Mexico Border, so we will not have to get an export permit of any sort.3.- Swing: This is going to be a base load plant, that will be dispatched around 90% on a yearly average.   However CFE has the right to take zero power at their full discretion, so Edf does not wsant to take the risk of not being dispatched and not being able to swing down to zero during the 25 years of the gas supply.   However, the plant will most certainly displace other less efficient plants in the first 10 years, so that such risk is much lower. In our proposal we can include either zero swing or which ever we feel we are the most competitive. They will evaluate whether such risk could be taken by them. 4.- Modifying Swing every 2 years.   They believe that in the long run (25 years), the dispatching rules or conditions of the plant could change. So they want to have the option to review the swing every 2 years. Can we price this optionality ? Is there a re-purchase of such optionality in the market ? 5.- Resale formula. They need us to include a daily re-sale fomula for the gas not taken.6.- Other Provisions: We need to review the other provisions in the RFP and tell them which ones can we comply with and which ones we don't. I am faxing you the entire RFP, together with the latest letter we received from them. Please give me a call whenevr you have a chance.   Best regards. \n"

The storage has no forward value, it was included to take advantage of opportunities as they occur.   I want to be clear AGAIN about how the transportation transaction should be accrual upside and not booked as MTM as our view is that the spreads will compress over time and any spread value that exists from the curves today will likely go away or be significantly reduced over time .

My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.   I only considered CR \"Recomended \" cars.   There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.   The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.   Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 19991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.

I thought there were exclusions relative to EOL transactions and points that do not directly impact HPL.   The problem for me is that if I want to do terms deals in these locations now I want to be able to keep them as ENA and not transfer them with the HPL sale.   Let's talk as soon as possible so I can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ENA now and after the close.Thanks,Tom\n"

      "body": "\nI received notice today that Elsa Villareal , Gary Lamphier and Ed Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).   This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:1 Lead Physical Trader1 Physical Trader1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator1 Supply Middle Marketer/OriginatorI met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.   They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.   Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.   I know that she has been contacted by companies other   than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.Thanks,Tom\n"
