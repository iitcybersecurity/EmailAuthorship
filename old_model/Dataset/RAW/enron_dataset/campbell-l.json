      "body": "\nYesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.   I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.   They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.   I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate   some construction activities   such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.   I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.   I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.   Ill keep you apprised of this issue.\n"

VAldostaTherefore, for Monday, October 9, 2000 at 10:000 a.m., Valdosta primary pool will be under a Demand Mismatch Order.Based on the current supply levels and expected demand levels, AGLC's system cannot manage the potential excess demand and the operational integrity of the system will be threatened. Therefore, it is essential that your interruptible customer's demand does not exceed the scheduled supply for your interruptible market for each primary pool under the demand mismatch order.This demand mismatch order carries a potential incentive charge of $30.000/dth for under deliveries to AGLC's system.Each shipper/pooler/marketer is responsible for contacting their interruptible customers to curtail demand if necessary to meet this order. Marketers/Poolers are responsible for maintaining interruptible customer contact information. Any customer contact information in GOS is for AGLC internal use and is not intended to be marketers/poolers point of contact for curtailments.If you have any questions regarding the demand mismatch order, please call Brad Freeman at 404-584-49993, or Gas Operations at 404-584-444777.\n"

      "body": "\nTranswestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1 C/S which occurred in 19996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 19996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of interchangeable internal components from a 47000 turbine into the existing smaller turbine (3505).   The larger internal components   (inlet guide vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.   When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher turbine value 47000.   The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.   Only Solar is authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.   This prevents Transwestern from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this turbine at their descretion.In the 19996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a emissions test of the 47000 to determine if emissions were more or less than the permitted values for the 3505.   It was shown that emissions from the 47000 were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.   It should also be mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 47000 is a simple cycle.   Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.   Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.   Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing. Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and handle this issue.   Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a conference call for sometime next week? \n"

Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request   an expidited review   of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.\n"

      "body": "\nThe third quarter PCB meeting with Southern California Gas Company was held this morning.   SoCal presented a third quarter invoce of their PCB management and disposal activities for which Transwestern is responsible for $120,602.19 (86%).   All charges were appropriate and considered normal operating expenses for PCB activities in California.   On a similar note, while speaking to Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal, some interesting things are happening on their system and are presented below:SoCal is beginning to notice accumulations of PCB pipeline liquids on portions of their system which has been considered PCB clean.   It is these portions of their pipeline for which they have been petitioning EPA to declassify.   These liquids are not new liquids introductions into the SoCal system but historic liquids that have laid in their pipeline. Because of the fact that Transwestern is not seeing liquids accumulations at the compressor stations upstream of Needles, we know that liquids are not being sent inot California.   Due to the increase of Transwestern gas into the SoCal system, it appears   the gas is sweeping old historic liquids into these new pipeline areas.   SoCal will be meeting with PG&amp;E within the next couple of weeks to discuss the discovery of pipeline liquids at an interconnect where SoCal provides natural gas to PG&amp;E.The PCB concentrations are less than 5 ppm.   The location of this   interconnect is near Bakersfield, Ca.Southwest Gas has requested that 2 filter separators be installed at 2 interconnects where they receive gas from SoCal.   As you know, Transwetern supplies gas to SoCal who then provides gas to Southwest.   The price of the 2 separators will be approx. $333,000 plus installation charges.   Ralph stated that theses charges will show up on the first or second quarter of 20002.   Of note, Southwest has asked SoCal to install each separator on the SoCal side of the interconnect which means that maintenance and operation of each separator will be SoCal's responsiblility.   these charges will be passed on to Transwestern at 86%.\n"

It'sa classic that should never be deleted.   Enjoy.CD&lt; The Teabagging&lt; The all time classic maneuver of tapping your cockon her forehead whilst&lt; she is sucking on your balls, and uttering thetimeless phrase '''Who's&lt; Your daddy'''&lt;&lt; The Houdini&lt; Going at it doggy-style until you are just about tocome,&lt; then pull out and spit on her back so she thinksthat you&lt; have. When she turns around a blast is unleashedinto her face and she is&lt; left shocked&lt; and amazed, wondering how you managed it.&lt;&lt; The Angry Dragon&lt; Immediately after you blow your load in a girl'smouth,&lt; smack the back of her head and make it come out hernose.&lt; When she gets up she'll look like an angry dragon.&lt;&lt; Cum Guzzling Sperm Burping Bitch&lt; The once in a lifetime act of blowing a hot steamyload down&lt; the back of a girl's throat and then proceeding togive her a large cold&lt; bottle of your favorite carbonated drink, making herguzzle&lt; it down. Then, shake her head vigorously back andforth to&lt; create the Cum Guzzling, Sperm Burping effect. Agreat way to impress&lt; your friends.&lt;&lt; Dirty Sanchez&lt; A time honored event in which while laying the bonedoggy-style, you&lt; insert your finger into her asshole. You then pullit out and wipe it&lt; across her upper lip, leaving a thin shit moustache.This makes her look&lt; like someone whose name is Dirty Sanchez.&lt;&lt;&lt; The Donkey Punch&lt; Banging a girl doggy style and then moments beforeyou cum, you stick&lt; your dick in her ass and then punch her in the backof the neck. The blow&lt; to the neck will stun the muscles in the female'sass, which will&lt; constrict the penis and give you a tremendousorgasmic experience when&lt; you ejaculate.&lt;&lt; The Flaming Amazon&lt; This one's for all you pyromaniacs out there.&lt; When you're screwing some chick, right when yourabout to cum, pull out&lt; and quickly grab the nearest lighter and set herpubes on fire,&lt; then...extinguish the flames with your jizz!&lt;&lt;&lt; The Flying Camel&lt; A personal favorite. As she is lying on her back andyou are hammering&lt; her on your knees, you very carefully move forwardand prop yourself&lt; (without using your arms) on your dick while it isstill inserted in her&lt; vertical seafood taco. You then proceed to flap yourarms and let out a&lt; long shrieking howl, much like a flying camel.&lt; Strictly a classy move.&lt;&lt;&lt; The Screwnicorn&lt; When you get a dyke to put her strap-on dildo on herforehead and proceed&lt; to go at her partner like a crazed unicorn.&lt;&lt;&lt; The Zombie Mask&lt; While getting head from yourfavorite,unsuspecting,trash-barrel whore,&lt; tell her you want her to look right up at you withthose \"pretty little&lt; eyes\" when you blow your load. Then, just whenyou're ready to spew a&lt; good week's worth of goo, blast that hefty load inboth eyes. This&lt; temporary state of blindness will produce the zombieeffect as she&lt; stumbles around the room with arms outstretched, andmoaning like the&lt; walking dead.&lt;--- Mark Reagan &lt;markreagan@yahoo.com&lt; wrote:&lt; I just left a message for a guy named freddie&lt; sanchez.&lt; This made me laugh.

The agency provided a tentative date of 7 weeks before the the permits would be issued.   The EPA has required Transwestern to respond to issues related to the Endangered Species Act prior to issuance of the air permit.   Transwestern is in the process of preparing a biological assessment for the properties within the facility fences of stations 3 and 4.A meeting was held with the Arizona DEQ to discuss what activities Transwestern may participate in to assist the agency with the issuance of the air permits for Station 1 and 2.   The agency gave a date of April 20002 as a normal issue date.   Even under expidited conditions the date is expected to be mid December of this year.   Transwestern plans on actively pursuing ADEQ's management to determine if the date for issuance can be further decreased.   On a side note, under the current Arizona regulations, certain construction activities can begin in leau of receiving the permit and include; foundation construction, laying underground piping and consturction of permenant underground structures.

        " Larry Campbell/ET&amp;S/Enron on 07/31/20001 09:17 AM ---   \tFrom:   David Roensch   07/29/20001 08:444 PM To: Larry Campbell/ET&amp;S/Enron@Enron, John Shafer/OTS/Enroncc:   Subject: Larry, per our phone conversation tonight.   I found this article interesting, especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.   Note the section below in bold Red text.   Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff off Interstate 15.   This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW's but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving these areas...   Anyhow, fyi...   (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust &amp; The Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)   New land pegged for preservationBy ANNE MINARDSun Staff Reporter07/29/20001   |Reader CommentsIt's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowlyrejected Proposition 1000, a plan to protect 290,000acres of State Trust Land from development.And in about a month, voters could be asked to beginsigning petitions to get another initiative on theballot that would protect significantly more of thestate's legacy --- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.The difference, conservationists say, is that this landhas been chosen with the goal of protecting biologicallyand aesthetically important areas. The environmentalcommunity rallied against Prop. 1000 because they saidthe lands chosen for protection were insufficient andhad little value for conservation.For example, the Proposition 1000 campaign identified 10acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff --- near awastewater treatment plant outflow --- as one of thestate's \"crown jewels\" needing to be preserved.Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of anindustrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes litteredwith shot-up refrigerators and television sets calledTurkey Hills.Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystemsouth of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservationunder Prop 1000. But that plan only included its soggylakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developableshoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department wasstill up for grabs.THE NEW PLANThe new initiative would include all areas around RogersLake, excluding those that are private or held by theU.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fallin the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie betweenFlagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included isSection 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,but at densities that are still in dispute between thecounty and the city).Other areas would include parcels around ObservatoryMesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of theNaval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern ofsections --- interspersed with Forest Service land ---south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village andGriffiths Spring.Like Prop. 1000, an initiative would be only a firststep. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutionalamendment, to change the availability of State TrustLands.State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres acrossthe country --- 9.3 million in Arizona --- originallyallocated by the federal government when each state wasformed to help fund public schools. (See related storyon Page A111.)Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based GrandCanyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paidfor with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set asideunder the initiative could still be leased for grazing,agriculture or other current uses --- but they wouldnever be sold for commercial development.Making an informed decision to set aside designatedState Trust Lands will free others from the battles thatnow accompany proposals to develop them, he said.The initiative is a collaborative effort between theGrand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, alongwith some business and development affiliates.And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted bythe Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucsonand the Nature Conservancy that showed 888 percent ofArizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State TrustLand should be conserved.TALKING COMPENSATIONBut members of the State Department of Lands chargedwith managing the tracts --- and a lobbyist forsuperintendents and principals in the state's schoolsystem --- say the initiative backers are missing themark in the state land debate.\"We have a fundamental difference of opinion with ourfriends in the environmental community,\" said MikeSmith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona SchoolAdministrator Association. \"Preserve, set aside ... wethink those are great ideas. The question iscompensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust forthe schools. It's acutely important for schools tomaximize the returns on state lands.\"Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy isnew for the state's schools. Until recently, the schoolsdidn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.\"We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature hastaken the annual earnings, and has used it to reducestate aid coming out of the general fund.\"That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,passed last year, he said.\"In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from thestate trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of asudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplantedour funding, now it will supplement it. It's real moneyto us.\"The Legislature will still keep the money it has beenearning from State Trust Lands --- about $80 million ayear. But anything above that mark will now go to theschools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager ofcommunications and legislative affairs for the ArizonaDepartment of Lands, are optimistic that figure willclimb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimatesthe schools could see $650 million in addition tolegislative appropriations over the next decade.LOOKING BACKBut the past irregularities are a stronghold forconservationists who are promoting the land reforminitiative.In background literature for its State Trust Land ReformInitiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the StateTrust Lands haven't been used as they were intendedanyway, and very little money has gone to Arizonaschools.\"State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percentof the annual funding for public education,\" thedocument reads. \"... there is little, if any, directbenefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools.\"Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with thatassessment.\"I think those statements are severely misleading andnot reflective of what is currently the case. You canthrow around percentages any way you want. If you lookat what the trust has been contributing to the schoolconstruction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent.\"Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future ofState Trust Land will rest on its ability to generatefunds --- and won't be given away for free.\"It comes down to this: We are in intense discussionwith the conservation community,\" Smith said. \"Ourconversations are all around the question ofcompensation. We are not going to support any initiativethat contemplates setting aside State Trust Land withoutcompensation. You can take that non-support as far asyou like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we aregoing with them.\"Anne Minard can be reached at aminard@azdailysun.com or5556-22253.\n"

One by one, they&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; offered their evidence:&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; THREE PROOFS THAT JESUS WAS MEXICAN:&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 1. His first name was Jesus&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 2. He was bilingual&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3. He was always being harassed by the authorities&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; But then there were equally good arguments that...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; JESUS WAS BLACK 1. He called everybody \"brother\"&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 2. He liked Gospel&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3. He couldn't get a fair trial&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; But then there were equally good arguments that...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; JESUS WAS JEWISH&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 1. He went into His Father's business&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 2. He lived at home until he was 333&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3. He was sure his Mother was a virgin, and his Mother&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; was sure he was God&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; But then there were equally good arguments that...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; JESUS WAS ITALIAN&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 1. He talked with his hands&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 2. He had wine with every meal&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3. He used olive oil&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; But then there were equally good arguments that...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; JESUS WAS A CALIFORNIAN&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 1. He never cut his hair&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 2. He walked around barefoot&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3. He started a new religion&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; But then there were equally good arguments that...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; JESUS WAS IRISH&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 1. He never got married&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 2. He was always telling stories&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3. He loved green pastures&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; But perhaps the most compelling evidence...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; THREE PROOFS THAT JESUS WAS A WOMAN ...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 1. He had to feed a crowd at a moment's notice when&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; there was no food&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 2. He kept trying to get the message across to a bunch&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; of men who JUST DIDN'T GET IT&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; 3. Even when He was dead, He had to get up because&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; there was more work for him to do&lt; &lt; &lt;___Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:///explorer.msn.com\n"

When the tie is import constrained in BME, prices there since the 10006 ECAs were   implemented have been as low as -$1000.? In this case the BME price would   be used for settlement, and you would be paid $1000/MWh to export power there   (as your export would offset inbound congestion).?As more people begin   to take advantage of this, the BME prices can be expected to be less   negative.?Caution!? If   you schedule a transaction DA, but it fails the DA checkout, when there is   congestion on the ties in BME, you will have to settle the difference at the BME   price, and could get hammered.?NYISO will probably   issue a bulletin about this later today.?Scott\n"

This notification from the agency originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.   I called the TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.   Because VOC's are the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999 inventory.   Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50 tons/yr actuals and 333.56 tons/yr potentials.   We discussed why EOTT would submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.   The only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this facility was shown as a title V source.   According to the phone records from the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had   requested that the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.   I have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed for this facility in the near future.   In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 1000 ton/yr limit on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10 (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating throughput to be below the 1000 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.\n"

Concerning the agenda, the first day is devoted to presentations.   The second moring will be devoted to a   \"surprise\" participation at a local compressor station about 45 miles west of Albuquerque.   I havent spread this around yet, except to Rich Jolly and got his OK, but   I plan on dividing the guys into groups of 2 and having them conduct an investigation/audit of the compressor station.   I plan on setting and hiding   some placebo environmental issues the night before at the station to see if they can discover them and other housekeeping issues the next morning during the audit.   We will then convine back at the hotel in the afternoon to discuss what they found and how they would address the issues identified.   The group that identifies the most issues, will get a small gift.   Do I need your approval on the spending of some $$$ for a gift?   I was thinking of a couple of $25 gift certificates for the two winners at a big sporting goods store and let them choose what they want.   The final afternoon session will be devoted to mock environmental situations under varying circumstances, like we did last year with the whole group being divided into four individuals and participating as teams. thoughts comments...From: John Shafer/ENRON@enronXgate on 09/07/20001 04:34 PM CDTTo: Larry Campbell/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: RE: Albuquerque Environmental Roundtable, Oct. 16-17I plan on coming for at least a day.

Is someone talking with theLittle America Hotel in Flagstaff and blocking out enough rooms for ourmeeting?   When can we get some preliminary dates (How about the week ofApril 222, 20002?)???   If that week is not good, then go to the second weekin May as I will have serious conflicts with the first week of May.   Also,who will be in charge of planning the evening dinners?

I have spoken to Roger Kohn,EPA permit engineer,   about the possibility of not doing the turbine installation at station 4 only due to what you described as not enough market commitment.   My plans are to hold off on making any decisions and have the EPA issue the station 4 permit.   If we do not initiate any construction pertaining to the turbine or auxillary generators, then the new permit doesnt apply and we can still operate under the existing permit which was issued about 2 years ago.   In Enron, 6 months is an eternity and who knows what will happern then?   By having the permit, but not constructing, we will be   OK.   If we decide to do the turbine project   within the period of time that the permit is valid, then were ahead of the game.   If not, and a more firm decision is made to not do anything in the future, Ill contact EPA and request termination of the permit.   Usually, the agency places a caveot that if construction does not proceed in a specified time then the permit automatically cancels itself and the facility must comply witht he conditions of the existing permit for the facility...

Has EPA already been notified?   If not, we should put the proper spin on it, which, in my opinion, should come from Marketing.   Something like, \"we tried hard, and continue to try hard, to sell more capacity, but the market has not cooperated, so we must defer (not cancel) the station for now.

What concerns me most about this scenario is that we pressured the EPA Region IX quite a lot to get this permit and now we are just going to let a portion of it go \"null and void\".   At least, the portion applicable to Station 4.   I know we didn't lean on the EPA as hard as we did the AZDEQ, but we did repeatedly call them.   Even the FERC Environmental Staff was calling Region IX asking when were they going to get the draft out - because the FERC was under the assumption that we needed all or none.   At a time when Enron's veracity has come into question all across America, its too bad there isn't a better way to handle this.   Don't be surprised the next time you go in asking for expedited treatment on a federal air permit, if the regulators look at you with a \"question\" mark.   I wouldn't say we \"burned bridges\", but we definitely used some \"green stamps\".   There are only so many \"green stamps\" that we can use with an agency and we used a bundle on this one - and now we don't need it.

      "body": "\nJohn, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA=\r=20\rpermits for 3 and 4.   Briefly here they are.\r First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.   It applies to hours=\r=20\rof operation for the generator.   The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation=\r=20\rbecause we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.   In talking to=20\rShdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all=20\rapplications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not=20\rtriggered.   This is there policy not regulation.   What is ironic is that=\r=20\rthey accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that=\r=20\rthey would apply any safety factor for their comfort.   Im concerned about t=\rhe=20\rtime frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.   I need=\r=20\rsome guidance.   Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how lon=\rg=20\rit will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic=20\rconverter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?   In speakin=\rg=20\rwith Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches th=\re=20\rPSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of contro=\rl=20\rtechnology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.   I know=\r=20\rtime is of the essence.\r Second issue.   The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and=\r=20\r4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr=\r=20\ror ton/yr.   The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppm=\rvd=20\rfor NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, =\rat=20\rlower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are=\r=20\r40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.   We cant live with this.   In our application, we=\r=20\rstated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we=\r=20\rapplied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented=\r=20\rthis in lb.hr and tons/yr.   This would have covered us, but because the=20\rpermits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed   these limits during low loads=\r=20\rand low temps.   I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit=20\rconditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with=\r=20\rwith requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he wou=\rld=20\rbring this before his management.   Ill keep you apprised of this issue.\r =20\r---"

Jesse Jackson   Due to the great consternation caused by the   revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my   obligation to give an explanation to the   population for my act of copulation.   I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of   sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through   masturbation, resulted in my fornication.   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with   excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and   liberation.   She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I   wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried   for   duplication but I insisted upon   termination, in spite of her fascination with   variation.   This has caused me great aggravation, and the   agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in   my humiliation, denigration, and   degradation. My wife is considering castration, which   would require my hospitalization.   Pray that this matter will find culmination in my   sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for   nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in   revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation   has provided illumination and verification and will   prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

Shudeish had copies of the draft permits, which Larry reviewed and found satisfactory. Apparently, about three weeks ago, Prabhat Bargava left his DEQ position as Section Manager, Compliance, to take a position with a consultant, CH2M Hill, which is trying to start an air group in Arizona.I just spoke with Shudeish about how soon the actual permits will be issued. He said that DEQ had to wait a few days after the November 23 close of the comment period (this was announced at the hearing) to allow mailed comments postmarked on Friday, Nov 23 to reach DEQ. He then said that he expected both permits would be issued middle to end of next week (by Nov. 30): he said he had to blend the EPA issues into the permits, but that was not problemmatic. Larry talked with Shudeish last night about the EPA issues, and that did not seem to be any difficulty.I then asked Shudeish why the comment period was extended until Nov 23 when the rule states that the comment period is only 30 days long and the comment period opened by first publication on October 17. The public hearing also must be no sooner than 30 days after first publication, and that is why it was set for Nov. 19. Thus, even allowing for a couple of days after what should have been the close of comment period (Nov 19, because Nov 17 was a Saturday), the permits should be issued by the first of next week rather than the end of the week. Shudeish said he would check and get back to me.I know this is only a couple of days difference (assuming the permits are issued by Nov 30), but I am sensitive to Jerry's urgency to get moving quickly, and I also want to lay some groundwork to object if actual issuance starts dragging.Please let me know if you have any thoughts or comments.Van WolfThe information contained in this electronic mail message is confidential information intended only for the use of the individual or entity named above, and may be privileged.

He said that it would take \"an act ofcongress\" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a NationalMonument.   The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south ofCordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of theInterstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we couldget into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.

      "body": "\nIvan,   the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management. They are having a big pow-wow   this week to get things straightened out.   The new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I   will be speaking with him next week.   In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled   to meet with the Arizona Director in a couple of weeks.   Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in Enron.   Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is placing a large part of its emphasis.

I also made some initial contacts with the RMEF and have onlymanaged to play phone tag with the people I really needed to talk to.Sounds like you've had better luck.My approach was to look at a way to partner with the RMEF with their landand habitat conservation programs on a national level rather than focusingon any particular state.   Hopefully this would encourage broad based Enronemployee support and not foster any state biased partisanship.Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation contact I tried is:   Tony Schoonen   VP Marketing   Missoula, MT   406/523-3432Other Enron Employees I discussed this endeavor with and have indicatedtheir support are: Ken Crowl (Omaha), Virgil Pfennig (Iowa), &amp; Ty McNeil(Clifton, KS).Others that might be interested are: Bob Besecker (Hugoton, KS), Roger Buck(South Omaha), Andy Gieser (Omaha), Bill Sugg (Glasgow, MT), Ray Knox(Clifton, KS), Joe Hill (Wolf Point, MT), Ron Omsberg (Mandan, ND), JohnNelson (North Branch, MN), Don Keller (Beatrice, NE), Larry Lottman(Beatrice, NE), Steve Stedman (Beatrice, NE), Dale Johns (Palmyra, NE),Kurt Weber (Beatrice, NE), Scott Finkbiner (Glasgow, MT), Bob Hopkins (WolfPoint, MT), Roger Westfall (Omaha), &amp; Jeff Boyce (Glen Ullin, ND).All these are from my previous experience in North Operations.   As Idevelop relationships as HR Rep for SE Operations, I am sure I will findmore interested employees.Let me know what you think we should do from here.ivan - ---Original Message---From:   Campbell, Larry [mailto:Larry.Campbell@ENRON.com]Sent:   Wednesday, May 30, 20001 12:35 PMTo:   Hamilton, IvanCc:   Shafer, John; Rice, RandySubject:   RE: Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation contactIvan, I had an opportunity to make contact with the Rocky Mountain ElkFoundation.

      "body": "\nDonna/Arnold   sorry about not making the conference call today.   The state of New Mexico showed up at my office this   morning and made a surprise inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.   I felt the need to tag along with them... Heres the way it is.   The EPA is required to address all federal concerns when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.   Even when it comes to an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species Act (ESA).   This is not a new issue with the EPA.   Im having the same thing happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.   The permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.   I told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.   (As you remember, the Navajo Nation verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys with the EPA.   Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as to whether surveys would be required or not.   I told him that we were expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.   He advised me not to do this.   I think his decision had something to do with   the EPA usurping authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without Indian consent.   He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these types of issues. Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly   delay issuance of the permits.   Ill send something out via email when I hear from the EPA.   From: Donna Martens/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/16/20001 02:06 PM CDTTo: Larry Campbell/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: FW: question on TranswesternLarry -Arnold reported in the weekly meeting today that the EPA is requesting a T&amp;E survey at Stations 3 &amp; 4 prior to issuing air permits.   Don't know if you anticipate this being a problem or lengthy process, but Steve Burns sent the following message to me (which I thought I had forwarded to you-sorry looks like I didn't).   Any way, I don't know if he could help push the process along or not or if the permits he is talking about are ROW only...if so, give him a call. ---Original Message---From:   Burns, Stephen   Sent: Monday, July 30, 20001 10:222 AMTo: Martens, DonnaCc: Fritch, Bret; Gutierrez, Cecil; Bagot, Nancy; Westbrook, Roger; Robertson, Linda; Nord, SueSubject: RE: question on TranswesternThanks, Donna.The reason I ask is that we've been fighting a long political/policy issue here in Washington on rights-of-way across federal lands.   Thus far the issue has focused on telecommunications (EBS and fiber optic cables).   The agencies we've been pitted against are the BLM and Forest Service, and the issue is the federal land agencies have tried to raise ROW fees and rents to exorbitant levels in order to get more money out of companies.The agencies have recently said that what they tried to do to fiber cables they'll also do to pipelines.   Two weeks ago, I spoke at a pipelines conference in New Orleans on this issue.   El Paso pipelines told me they've had a tough time getting compression station upgrade permits from the BLM for their pipeline expansion into California.My request therefore would only be that IF you have any problems with the Forest Service in obtaining permits or new rights-of-way, and you think you might need some help, please feel free to let me know.   We meet regularly with Dept of Agriculture senior staff, and should soon meet with the new Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth.   We could help if you have any problems.(Can't help you with the Navajo Nation, though!

      "body": "\nJohn, I plan on grabbing not only a digital camera but also my video camera to handle the panarama part of the equations.   In conversations with Doug Cebryk, it looks like the primary routes are Interstate 17 and El Paso's existing right of way south.   I spoke with Kevin Hyatt about a possible route that exists south to a power plant between station 1 and Kingman Az, and then heading southeast into the Phoenix area, but didnt know if the economics would work out. Ive got ENSR looking at other routes that might hold promise.   I also plan on addressing what might be considered sensitive areas of potential impact (streams, rivers, riparian habitat, difficult terrain, population and   critical habitat   issues etc)   Ill have a report to you shortly after the trip...From: John Shafer/ENRON@enronXgate on 08/31/20001 08:333 AM CDTTo: Larry Campbell/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONcc: Mike Riedel/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, William Kendrick/ENRON@enronXgate, Louis Soldano/ENRON@enronXgate, jschmidt@ENSR.com@SMTP@enronXgate, Eric Gadd/ENRON@enronXgate, Kevin Hyatt/ENRON@enronxgate, Doug Cebryk/ENRON@enronXgate, Randy Rice/ENRON@enronXgate, Stephen Veatch/ENRON@enronXgate, Joe Hartsoe/ENRON@enronXgate, Gina Taylor/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: Sun Devil - Helicopter Fly-Over of Routes Larry,Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug Cebryk.   I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are there.   Don't forget to take your camera.   Pictures (slides) would be most helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield portion.   As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will need to develop some preliminary maps.   It is my understanding that no maps of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.After we receive the \"fatal-flaw\" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, etc).   These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw analysis.2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources early in the process.4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news media.   This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or Houston, etc.).   A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix area and for the Southwest.I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events coordinated.   John Shafer\n"

I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.   They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.   I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate   some construction activities   such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.   I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.   I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.   Ill keep you apprised of this issue.]I spoke with the ADEQ after our conference call and they directed me to another group (compliance) in the air permit section.   They strongly suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona, Director of the ADEQ.   I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?) 602-207-2328, but have not heard back from her.   Either Bill Kendrick or I will   be touching base with her again, tomorrow.Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air permits: all earthwork trench construction and piping tie ins all foundation and building construction installation of ancillary equipmentThis list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may allow us to do.The EPA contact for the Sta. 3 and 4 air permits: permit engineer   Roger Cohn   (415) 7444-1238   Supervisor   Geraldo Rios   (415) 7444-1259The ADEQ contact for Sta. 1 and 2 air permit permit engineer   Shudeish Mahadev (?)

When I told them that we were expecting the permits by the end of September, each agency indicated that a September permit issuance would not be a problem, in light of the fact that energy issues were to be given top priority in the State of Califonia.   I phoned the   permit engineer assigned to each application monthly to be kept aware of possible conflicts and resolve any concerns.   In all monthly calls, both agencies assured me that things were progressing on schedule.   As we approached the anticipated September issuance, calls to the agencies were conducted weekly and this was when I found out about the 1-4 month additional time which would be required for the permit issuance.

The most critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below. The permits really restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.   We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.   Let me know what additional information you may need. 1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP SouthwestOperations.2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, basedon a 3-hour   average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.   At 60Fand above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under alloperating conditions.   However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% ofthe time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20%of the time.   TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods ofreduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.   The potentialto emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units oflb/hr and ton/yr.   These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPAfor the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPAStatement of Basis document). Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvdvalues and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned thatunder low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, theemissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.   Transwestern isrequesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allowsemissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time thatthe turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.3. The word \"Catepillar\" is mispelled throughout the permit.4. Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requiresTranswestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are notnormally used to monitor and   measure sulfur in the natural gas.Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuelmonitoring schedules to use   \"GPA Standard 23777\" (length of stain tube) orgas chromatography as the proposed methodology   to   monitor sulfur in thenatural gas.\n"

Transwestern had met with the AQB over this issue in 19996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of internal components from a smaller turbine to a larger turbine, with the internal components of the larger turbine components (inlet guide vane adjustment and removal of the regenerator) mechanically adjusted to simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.   When Transwestern received permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity, Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments operable.   Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to be outstanding as determined by the EPA.   Dave Nutt has been sent the Compliance Order to review.   Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern has 30 days to request another hearing.   \n"

      "body": "\nTranswestern Pipeline CompanyTranswestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for the Redrock Expansion.   For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD. This means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the allowable hours of operation for   the generator from 8760 to 78000.   This generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be operated for 8760 hours.   Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority to apply a 10%safety factor.For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25 ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.   Manufacturerers guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.   It appears that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.Northern Natural Gas CompanyA standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No. 1 facility was submitted to the TNRCC.   Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42 emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V facility.   Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not greater than 1000 ton/year sources.   Continued investigation   is being conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility. EOTTA request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.   New data on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit. GeneralPreparations are being   finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held next week in Albuquerque.\n"
