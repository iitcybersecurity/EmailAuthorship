The Bureau has now come back to us and has asked us to clarify how we would propose resolving the privilege question.   We have volunteered to have this discussion with them, but to this point in time, they have not responded to us.If, as and when the conversation occurs, our position will be that we intend to claim privilege with respect to conversations with lawyers only.   How this particular aspect of the matter would be resolved is not as yet clear.Our view is that with respect to the conversations they have, they are not particularly damaging but the conversations do not particularly add to the flavour of the matter to our benefit.On Wednesday of next week, we will be meeting with counsel for Powerex to see exactly which conversations they have delivered to the Bureau.   We will advise him of the conversations that have been taken by the Bureau from our offices and at the conclusion of this matter, we should be able to see exactly what it is that the Bureau has in terms of conversations between Powerex and Enron.We look forward to discussing this matter with you at your convenience.YtWeb Macdonald\n"

We have had enthusiastic responses   from companies such as AT&amp;T, Duke Energy, Pitney Bowes and DaimlerChrysler,   and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have about this focal   point for our educational efforts.? The real purpose of my call, however,   is related to the services we will provide to support the aspirational   statements of the Protocol.I am a member of the design group that has been developing the American   Arbitration Association's dispute management systems and services for eCommerce   B2B transactions.? At this time we are putting together small working   groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service   offerings.Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our   technology consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half   a day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from   finance, legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback   about our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief   description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for   discussion at the meeting.The real focus of the meeting will be on how   we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B   marketplaces.? We are very concerned with providing services that are   relevant to that environment.We would like to meet between November 14   and?December 1?since construction of our services is already   underway.? Please let me know what is possible, and feel free to give me a   call if you have any questions (978-376-90004).?Thanks.-&lt; GerryGerry StrathmanneCommerce GroupAmerican Arbitration   Association(978) 376-90004\n"

The first sentence preserves Enron's right to appeal the findings of an ADR proceeding that may emanate out of this matter to FERC or any competent court; as it turns out, this right is provided under Section 4.1 of the PX's Dispute Resolution Procedures.   The second sentence is intended to preserve Enron's right in other proceedings (as we have done already) to challenge the legality of ISOs and PXs to conduct investigations such as the one that they have in this instance:\"Nothing in this Settlement prejudices or limits Enron's rights under Section 4.1 of PX Tariff Schedule 9, Dispute Resolution Procedures, related to any ADR proceeding that may address the same subjects that are addressed in this Settlement.   Moreover, although Enron has agreed not to seek review of the decision and order issued by the Chief Executive Officer in this proceeding based upon this Offer of Settlement, nothing in this Settlement prejudices Enron's right in other proceedings to challenge the CalPX's right, under United States federal law, the Federal Power Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, and applicable FERC regulations and decisions, to investigate allegations of improper market behavior and to issue findings and impose sanctions related to such investigations.\"Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

This had beenhandled by Jud Scheaf and had been dormant for a long time, which is whyneither I nor anyone at the company knew about it.This is somewhat confusing, so let me try to explain.   The style isKilbarger Construction vs Eastland Energy Group, et al.   In the Court ofCommon Pleas of Muskingum County, Ohio   Case No. CH96-03111.CGAS had a lease in Muskingum County.   Eastland Energy had a lease on anadjoining tract.   Eastland approached CGAS about going together to drill awell on a unit formed by the two leases.   CGAS agreed.   Eastland wasdesignated operator.   Eastland hired Kilbarger as the drilling contractor.Kilbarger drilled the well and it was dry.   Eastland thought Kilbargernegligently drilled the well, so Eastland only paid Kilbarger half thedrilling cost.   Kilbarger filed a mechanics lien and filed suit againstEastland for the other half of the drilling costs (approximately $30,000)and also joined CGAS because of the mechanics lien.   Kilbarger was notseeking any monetary recovery from CGAS, and the lien is meaningless sinceCGAS has since released its lease.   Thus, we have no pending claims fromKilbarger.However, in the same case Eastland and CGAS have a claim pending.   Duringthe drilling of the well, some of the contractors would not work forEastland since they did not know Eastland - a new, small producer.   Thosecontractors therefore did the work on the well for CGAS, billed CGAS, CGASpaid those contractors, and CGAS then invoiced Eastland.   Eastland did notpay and therefore CGAS has a claim in this suit against Eastland for$7,139.69.   No monetary claim has been made by Eastland against CGAS.I just learned of this case and have taken over this file from Jud Scheaf.There is a settlement conference scheduled for December 9 and this case isset for trial on December 16.   I am hopeful this will be resolved beforetrial.   If there are questions, please call.\n"

Please delete the previous file you received and replace with this version.Pricing has the biggest impact on valuation from where we were 6 months ago, as depicted in the operations cash flow section for the Gulf Coast.As discussed, risk factors are estimates and are subjective.The Proved Undeveloped (PUD) reserves in the Rockies are based on the Netherland and Sewell (NSA) 1/1/999 reserve report and do not reflect what Enron thought 6 months ago.   Our in-house estimates of the PUD reserves are 50-75% of NSA and would indicate a current unrisked value for the PUDs of perhaps $4-5 million.   However, a potential acquirer may just use the NSA numbers and risk adjust as I have done in the spreadsheet.Let me know if you have any questions.Thanks,Jim Ledlow\n"

The decision is being handed down approximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.   Our counsel Jonathan Sumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:   (1) he believes the Lords would not have had a sufficient amount of time to do the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning the Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the individual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a decision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not writing the decision in our case.   For these reasons, the likelihood of the ruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently likelihood of success at 60%.   Our team believes that the CATS parties are unlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.   Because we believe we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up value by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not make an offer of settlement.   We expect to have a decision by 111:000 am London time on Wednesday;   judgement will be handed down formally at 2:000 pm that day.   I will make sure that each of you is contacted as soon as possible with the result.\n"

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $1555-160 million.   We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.   The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.   The opinion seeks to conclude \"what rational businessmen could have intended\" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.   For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the   \"retrospective consequences\" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.   His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.   Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.   The contract makes no reference to this requirement.   Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.   As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.   Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as \"appalling\" and \"pathetic,\" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been \"stitched up\".   Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.   The case has been a roller coaster ride;   I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.   My telephone number is 0111 444 207 783 6582.   Many thanks.\n"

Idelayed publishing this list until 6:000 p.m. because I kept receiving emailsfrom interested parties.   I also received the following report from JohnStamper at O'Melveny &amp; Myers who represents SEMPRA and San Diego Gas &amp;Electric.John had a conversation with Bob Moore from Millbank representing theCalifornia PX.   Bob apparently told John that invoices for the chargebackswill be issued on Monday February 5th and will be due and payable byThursday February 8th or Friday February 9th.   John asked for February 9thrather than the 8th.   John raised again the possibility of a standstillagreement.   Bob Moore reported that the CalPX was amenable to a standstillagreement if everybody agreed.   They are worried, however, about being suedfor failing to liquidate collateral as soon as they are able etc.   Johnpointed out that the CalPX might be subject to claims from those entitiesthat had their letters of credit drawn down improperly.   Bob then reportedthat the number one option that the   CalPX was considering was bankruptcy.It seems to them to be the one forum where they can get all the parties.They are also considering dissolution and invoking the ADR procedurethemselves.We have scheduled a teleconference to discuss the FERC options for 111:000a.m. PST on Monday February 5, 20001.   The call in number is 1-8000-205-3434,participant code: 653687I have also received a request to schedule an alternative teleconference for1:000 p.m. PST to consider non-FERC alternatives.   This would includelitigation alternatives.   We will distribute the dial in number and accesscode for that call on Monday morning.Proposed Agenda for 111:000 a.m. FERC Option Teleconference:I. Current Status of any proposed filings. Note:   Phil Fantle, in-house counsel for Cargill-Alliant sent me acopy of a filing they made   with FERC on January 29th.   I will send acopy under separate email cover.II. Discussion of specific relevant examples where CalPX has violatedthe tariff with respect to   specific PX Participants.   The purpose ofgathering these examples is to be able to   demonstrate that CalPX isacting arbitrarily and capriciously if that is case.   This couldinclude identification of specific instances of inconsistent treatment of PXParticipants or   inconsistent treatment of the same PX Participant. For example, Phil Fantle pointed out that the way he reads thetariff, if you look at the   chargeback formula set forth in Schedule 2,Section 5.3, the ratio for each PX Participant   appears to be a fixed numberthat   does not vary after the default of another PX Participant.   InPhil's example, if a defaulting participant has a 25% share of the grossMWHs sold in the Core market, during the chargeback process only 75%of the default is paid through   chargeback because there is no provision forrecalculating the chargeback formula.II. Summary of best arguments of why CalPX application of charge-back isinconsistent with   tariff.IV.

The idea is to file a brief joinder stating that the Participants' Committee in the CalPX case, representing constituents which are the real parties in interest of over $1.9 billion in claims against PG&amp;E, as scheduled by PG&amp;E in its list of 20 largest creditors, supports the motion and the joinder filed by the PG&amp;E creditors' committee.   Our joinder would state that there is no statutory basis for appointing a ratepayers' committee and that it is not in the best interest of the estate.   We might also indicate that we agree with PGE and the PGE creditors' committee that there are other means for ratepayers to be heard which make more sense than giving them official committee status.   We would also appear telephonically at the hearing, this Friday, at 10 a.m.Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like a conference call on this issue.   Also, please let me know as soon as possible if you object to the committee taking this position.Thank you.Jeffrey A.

The article today, not surprisingly, talks about the significant 3Q earnings that are anticipated to be reported by the unregulated generating companies (E.g., Reliant, NRG and Southern) that purchased the plants from PG&amp;E and SoCalEd.   While this \"news\" is not unexpected, it nonetheless is the type of article that tends to excite consumer advocates, politicians and regulators since it focuses on what it calls the \"irony\" of the utilities now suffering huge losses (which ultimately will be borne by consumers to some, and perhaps a large, extent) from having to buy power from assets they once owned.   Obviously, the concern is that the rhetoric overtakes a rational examination of the system.   I know that each of you are following this situation very closely, but I thought I would just drop you a quick note in any event.

Joe is at risk of losing the CFO and counsel, something I reported yesterday.   On top of that, the creditors committee is balking at spending a part of the approximately $20 million of \"unencumbered\" cash to keep the doors open and generate numbers that only benefit participants.   Joe is thinking about a liquidating plan.   He didn't have all the details, but he did mention several points.   Some amount would be set aside to pay the trade debt.   He used a $5 million number.   The total unsecured debt (not including participants' claims) could be as much as $20 million if rejection damages are included, so those creditors would stand to get around 25%.   The balance of the cash, after paying administrative costs, would go, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of participants.   The litigation and claims resolution would be under the control of the participants.   Some of the cash would pay for accounting work.   Other cash would pay for prosecution of litigation claims under the direction of a committee.   In the end, whatever cash remains together with any recoveries from litigation, would presumably be distributed to participants.   I assume the plan would designate some individual to supervise the wind up process.   The participants committee could remain in existence to supervise the process.   If we structured such a plan, we'd try to push it to confirmation quickly, assuming support from the creditors committee.   The option may be appointment of a trustee.   We should discuss our preference so that I can get back to Eisenberg promptly.\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

The Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, etc.   There is not 180 day period.   There is nothing.   Nonetheless, this does highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to weigh our options and strategy.   This is specially true for matters with respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that remains unfunded.   The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation expires on June 30, 20001.   At that time we have an argument that we will not replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not going to fund.I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now.   Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared.   An analysis would include.1.   Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement.   In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we want to make certain that no rights have been waived.   Also, we want to put them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications.2.   Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the current default.3.   Understand our obligations.   The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit).   By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.   Can they cure the default and make us fund.   What does bankruptcy do to this scenario.Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues.\n"

It appears that the major issues are (1) can they pass the Endurance Benchmark (24 day test) and (ii) that the estimated cost to complete the facility is in excess of amounts in the Interest Subaccount, Construction Fund, and Equity Contribution Account.   I am currently thinking that if it cost more than $4.5 million to complete the facility, senior lenders may not want to pursue completion in order to obtain our $4.5 million.\n"

She has discussed same with their chemist Bob Ash.Sharron has reached some conclusions that are far different from the claim which was submitted to her.   From our conversation, the main differences seem to be:1.   She is calculating the claim using the basis of valuation in the Philco contract.   That basis of valuation seems to coincide with your monthly storage declarations.   Your calculations appear to be based more on the spot price of the product. I believe the difference is around $.10 per lb which is very significant when so many lbs are involved.2.   There appears to be a discrepancy in the number of pounds involved in the claim.   Baytank's records seem to indicate around 2,000,000 lbs. whereas your claim references approx. 6,000,000 lbs.   Both Sharron and Bob think that a maximum of 4,000,000 lbs. should be considered.3.   Ancillary charges.   The Enron claim appears to include some Baytank charges that are not recoverable, such as tank cleaning, etc.   As a cargo policy normally insures against direct physical loss or damage to the product itself, there are some charges that are not recoverable under a cargo policy.   There also appear to be stock throughput charges in your claim through January of 2000, although the product would have been gone by the end of November.At any rate,   based on the valuation of product in the Philco contract (and the storage declarations that have been submitted for premium purposes), and there being a total of 4,000,000 pounds of product, Sharron has calculateda claim in the vicinity of $150,000.   This is obviously a far cry from the claim submitted of around $9000,000+.   Of course, if you consider a difference of $.10 /lb. and apply it to 4,000,000 lbs, you already have a difference of $4000,000.   If you then factor in the difference between 6,000,000 lbs claimed vs. 4,000,000 lbs. recognized by the adjusters, you have another significant sum.I would be interested in your comments at this point.   If you feel that the adjuster has everything wrong, I might suggest that we arrange a meeting and go through the claim point by point. This is sometimes the quickedt way to resolve major differences.Please let me know.Thanks and regards,Ted Rosen\n"

He said the view in the PX is that Enron is stalling.   I gave him the other side of the story.   He thinks nothing will be done until the next Market Monitoring COm meeting later this month (the PX web site does not list the date),   He says the matter will likely be discussed in Executive Session.   He also believes that the PX wants to meet with Enron and isn't likely to do anything publicly until after that meeting.Unfortunately, from talking to John, the perception at the PX appears to be that this matter should be handled like the Chicago Board of Trade where they monthly release a list of offenders and what they have done, and nobody thinks much about it.   It's routine.   That's the wat they want these to be in the future, but they realize that this one --- the first --- will seem much bigger than that because it is first.He said we got stuck because we did something significant and they really didn't have any process set up to handle these things.   He said the compliance staff has only gotten some real analytical skills as of Nov (although he mentioned outside consultants looked at our case).   We also aren't being picked on.   Other people are being investigated, but we're coming through first.   I asked about utility pressure.   He said he has been asked about the investigation by utility people, but doesn't believe it has caused any undue pressure on the PX.   He said, if they were being pressured, the investigation would have been completed by now.He said that they don't want to give the matter any more significance than it has, but they can't ignore it.   A 3000MW schedule over a 30 MW line just can't be ignored, he said.I didn't ask him for a heads' up on the public release of the letter, but I feel I can call him for updates at any time.\n"

In addition to those answers, weshould keep in mind that market value cannot necessarily be calculated withmathematical precision.   Market value is often described in terms of arange.   Indeed, the Inside FERC's Gas Market Reports publishes not only anindex price, but also a range of prices for each pipeline pricing point.In looking at the applicable indices for those two pipelines for some of thesample months, it is clear that, if $.10 or $.111 were deducted from theindex price, then the resulting price would still be in the range aspublished by Inside FERC.For example, in December 19996, the Transco Zone 3 index price was $3.82.The published range was $3.38 to $3.95.   So adjusting the index by 10 centsstill keeps you well within the range.Similarly, for the 19996 Koch So. La. index.   The index price was $3.82.   Therange was $3.555 to $3.94.   Again, an 111 cent adjustment is still well withinthe range.A quick review of other months shows that sometimes the range was narrower,and the adjustments would take you outside the range.   Nonetheless, weshould keep this background information in mind in case Justice continues topursue this point.Charles D. TetraultVinson &amp; Elkins L.L.P.14555 Pennsylvania Ave. N.

The contractor was Dan-Rik Construction Company out of Lafayette, La.   The contractor hit and damaged our facility at two locations, one being between our existing splice # 1 and splice #2,   three thousand feet of China.   The other location is under a canal, in the same vicinity.   The contractor contact information is : Dan Rik Construction Company PO Box 92868 Lafayette, La. 70509   Tel: 318.232.24888They are a sub-contractor to: Manuel Brothers, Inc.   908 Taylorville Road, Ste. 104   Grass Valley, Ca. 95949   Tel: 530.272.4213   We are in the process of   restoring our facilities and will invoice 'Dan Rik Construction'   all costs associated with the restoration.   PF Net is following our route through Texas into Louisiana and I am concerned about dig-ups that may occur bwtween China and the Louisiana border.   Is an injunction the only way to keep them a safe and reasonable distance from our facitlity?   Can we somehow put them on notice that we won't tolerate any future dig-ups and that if they do   damage our facility, we will replace it from splice to splice at their expense?   Please let me know.   Thank you.Brad Cheney\n"

It's a WORD feature that is used --- a lot --- for redlining drafts.   I see it used all the time on documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.   It has become popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are often missed in marked drafts.   I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've forbidden use of \"Track Changes\" and are advising their clients to do the same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by someone who knows anything about word processing technology.   Which makes for interesting results in document discovery... among other things.   Just thought I'd pass this along.

I am out of town until Friday, but we do plan on meetingFriday afternoon, I will respond on any additional information outstanding.(Charlie had Kelly McKenzie's book with him)You had ask that I further explain our deductions on the reduced Craft Laborhours detailed in my last letter.   In our December meeting it was noted thatNEPCO was in a support roll to Elliott on the rebuild.   NEPCO had their mostinvolvement at the very beginning and very end of the repairs.   The repairarea had its own trailers, parts warehouse and staging area.   We discussedin the meeting that the support roll essentially would take a Supervisor andthree employees per shift or about eight per 24 day.   In review of thesubmitted labor it is noted that an average of three Start-up Employeescharged their full day to this job from 6/15 up to 7/3, then 4 up to 7/17,then 6+ up to the final completion of repairs, 7/23.   At the same time,Office Staff employees averaged charging up to 8 employees per day, dayshift, during the repair time and continued to charge labor up to a monthafter.   The Craft Labor group charged an average of 111 employees per daycharging all of their work day to the repairs.   When you average it out, youhad around 13 support personnel for an Elliott crew on every shift (24hours), when the Elliott crew consisted of about 13 to 15 persons.   Thiswould account for between 25 to 30 people (without consultants &amp;sub-contractors) time charged working every hour, 24 hours the entire time.Add the consultants/subcontractors and it goes up to a minimum of 30 people.This is unrealistic by any standard and cannot be explained away as aninefficiency of site versus shop work.One of our requests in our meeting in Houston was that additionalinformation concerning the total labor and expenses charged to the entiresite be made available to see the \"big picture\" of the site labor andexpense charges on a weekly or monthly basis.   This additional informationor it's location has not been forthcoming to date.   There has to be sometype of summary cost details which Doyle was billed on a per Unit basis.I also noted that I would comment on differences in scope of repair, thus alesser measurement of the loss &amp; payable claim.   I have been commenting ondifferences in scope since my first letter and subsequently as informationhas been made available.   The major scope differences are:1. Partial vs. full stationary and rotor blades2. Repaired versus replaced 1st Stage Turbine Buckets &amp; Nozzles3. Use of \"old\" designed stub shaft vs. purchase of \"new\" designed stubshaft4. Overscope of repairs by Preco on work completed in their shop.5. Elliott overscope of repairs associated with some of the above items,misalignment and other items noted in my e-mail of 1/24 (including workcompleted on Units #2 &amp; #3).6. NEPCO labor charges noted above.There are a number of lessor items.   If the meeting this Friday takes place,I will respond as fully as possible to the claim next week based ondocumentation we have received to date.   It is unfortunate that there was no\"System 7000\" or similar type book completed on the repairs.   Our discussionsin Houston and up until recently indicated that this was an SOP at NEPCO.As I noted the Kelly McKenzie book is not a complete view of the repairsmade.The request to directly contact sub-contractors to discuss their scope ofwork in my last letter has not been responded to.Once again, I will e-mail you after our meeting Friday with any requestedsupport items that were to be included in this e-mail.Claude\n"

One of the new proposals could have implications for trading.   The proposal would arguably subject a company to suit in a jurisdiction where it has an accessible website for conducting e-commerce.   However, under the Convention this grant of jurisdiction would apparently (I am still studying this) be overridden by a contractually-agreed forum selection clause.   Do our current e-business contracts contain a forum selection clause?   Would you anticipate that we would conduct trades in the future without a previously-agreed forum selection clause?Thanks for your help.\n"

(\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Inc. (\"EESI\"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland General\")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").   Wemake these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 withthe understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offeringto produce or producing documents, these entities have not waived anyobjections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims,defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses havebeen specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected fromdisclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges.GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.   The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 19998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called \"family trees\" to show itscurrent organization.   To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called \"family trees\" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.   One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.   If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.   With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.   We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Datawill identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 111 The Enron Entities will produce its public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.   EPMI, ESSI, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic transaction data for the purchaseand sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   We anticipateproducing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 andthe transaction data in the second wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are very small and there will probably be limited documentsavailable.   The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a schedulingcoordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, donot have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unitrequested.   The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do havedocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las VegasCogeneration.   We propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions. For Portland General, there will be a very large volume of documentsand we propose to handle them differently.   First, Portland General willprovide for year 2000 electronic data in summary form similar to the databeing provided by other Enron Entities to the extent relevant.   With respectto specific generating cost data, because of the volume, we suggest thatthese documents be made available in Portland for inspection from arepresentative sampling of facilities.   If there are specific documents thatthe Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss thearrangements for producing these documents.   We propose to make thesedocuments available in Portland in a third wave of document productionsTRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequest 13, 15, 16, 17, 19 We understand that the CPUC will be obtaining trading data for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of trading data foryear 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity,delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is purchase or sale.   Becauseof the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that someentries will be incomplete or inaccurate.   For those transactions where EPMIserved only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO willshow part of the transaction, but there will not be a correspondingtransaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.   The reason is thatthis type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on anaccounting system rather than as part of the trading business.   EESI canalso provide similar electronic data with the proviso that it will notinclude the specific names of its retail customers but instead will providea blind customer number.   Many of ESSI's customers have agreements wherebythey must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.ESSI cannot meet your time frame to release information and give itscustomers the notice they require.   We anticipate producing the transactiondata in the second wave of document productions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.   We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.   It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.   If you have any questions orcomments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Dayor myself.Brobeck Phleger &amp; Harrison LLPGary Fergus===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

(collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron Energy Marketing&lt; Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland&lt; General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")&lt;&lt; Harvey,&lt;&lt;   I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and&lt; phone calls between Michael Day, on behalf of the Enron Entities, and&lt; yourself during the past few weeks.   Here is the current status as we&lt; understand it.   Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6,&lt; 2000 and October 18, 2000 (date of your confirming email) the Enron&lt; Entities have made the following document productions in response to the&lt; subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission (the&lt; \"Commission\"):&lt;&lt; * October 13, 2000   Bate Nos. Enron Entities 0001-00025 on behalf&lt; of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos. 1-111, 20.&lt;&lt; * October 27, 2000 Bate Nos. P0001-00021115 on behalf of Portland&lt; General Responsive to Request Nos. 12, 14, 16 and 18.&lt;&lt; * November 14, 2000 Bate No. Enron Entities 00026 (Diskette with&lt; EES/EEEMC retail data) Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13, 15 to 17,&lt; and 19.&lt;&lt; * November 15, 2000 Bate No. P00021116-00021117 (Diskettes with Portland&lt; General Data, which include approximate 3555,000 wholesale transactions)&lt; Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13 to 17, and 19.&lt;&lt; We believe with these productions, we have complied with the October&lt; 6-18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES/EEEMC.   As you&lt; know, these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights&lt; to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims, defenses,&lt; objections, jurisdictional or otherwise, or other responses.&lt;&lt;   We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for&lt; EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by&lt; October 27th.   However, we were also mindful of your expressed expectation&lt; that any data provided be useful and reliable.   The collection of data you&lt; requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same&lt; location nor organized as you requested it.   In fact during our review of&lt; some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the&lt; methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.&lt; When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it&lt; would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved,&lt; we informed you of the problem.   We now understand that if we cannot give&lt; you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be&lt; available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to&lt; compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission&lt; (\"FERC\").   We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data&lt; immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the&lt; immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce&lt; accurate data.&lt;&lt;   Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number&lt; of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas&lt; served on the Enron entities.   First, we understand that many other&lt; parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the&lt; detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very&lt; sound legal grounds.   Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing&lt; on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is&lt; supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes&lt; sought by other parties served.   Third, the Commission has filed its&lt; motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data&lt; from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited&lt; hearing and production schedule.   We note that the reasons stated in the&lt; motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially&lt; different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application&lt; to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.&lt; Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a&lt; tentative order as of November 1, 2000.&lt;&lt;   Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept \"most&lt; favored nation\" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests&lt; by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that&lt; was available.   However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need&lt; for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite&lt; substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate&lt; Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described&lt; intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal&lt; objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's&lt; threatened motion to compel before FERC.&lt;&lt;   We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission&lt; has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been&lt; served with subpoenas.   We understand that there is a list for those&lt; entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been&lt; delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their&lt; rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We understand that the Commission&lt; intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities that&lt; object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We deplore&lt; these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described&lt; above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating&lt; list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.&lt;&lt;   If you have and questions or comments, please do not hesitate to&lt; contact me.&lt;&lt;   Sincerely,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Gary S.&lt; Fergus===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

        " Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 10/06/999 08:14 AM ---Don Black@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT10/05/999 05:46 PMTo: Richard B Sanders@ECT, Greg Whalley@ECTcc:   Subject: Duke meetingJulian Poole and I attended at meeting at our office with Erik Ludtke and Amy Statler of Duke Intl. today.   We reviewed the tapes and the emails, and they are hanging their hat on the fact that the only monomic price published by Cammesa is the index to which they are referring.   Our answer to that claim is that they defined the trade as a 7 by 24 flat load, when the index they are trying to use is a demand weighted index.   Also, in the tape, immediately following the word \"monomic\" by Amy, is a definitional description; \"capacity plus energy\".   Cammesa states that there is no where that you can find the definition of the word monomic in their library.   We believe that monomic means the hourly price plus the capacity payment for peak hours.Lastly, the index she wants to use is a monthly number, published only once a month, but she states in her   \"let's add\" email that she would like it to \"be the monthly average of the monomic spot price published by Cammesa\"   I asked her how do you calculate the monthly average of a number that is published once a month.   I related to her that the logic did not follow.   She responded with a forgettable comment.We had a long discussion about whether or not a trade had occurred.   I explained to them that legally, the transaction is not closed until the deal is closed by an authorized ECT trader in Houston. Also, we explained the closure process to them multiple times.   We never admitted to a trade.They think that they caught Julian.   I told them that if they had been clearer in their definition of their desired index, I would feel a \"trader's obligation\" to follow-thru with the process, but if they wanted to use the \"Precio Medio Monomico as Published by the Cammesa in the section of The Boletin entitled Los Resultados Economicos for the applicable months\"   or   the \"Precio Medio En El Mes, Monomico, published in the Informe Mensual under the heading Precio de la Energia and Monomico\", they should have just said it.They want $5000,000 in LD's, or they will let us honor the trade and flip it out to them at $222.50 for a MTM loss of $308,000.   Our estimate is that the alleged trade is about $2220,000 out of the money at present.Our decision is to allow this matter to take its course.   Erik is going to decide what he wants to do, and will inform me.   If he wants to pursue the matter, he will refer the matter to Bruce of Duke Intl.If anyone has any instructions as to how we should proceed, please let us know.For future reference, the traders here have been informed to not agree to things in an email, even if they are agreeing to the clarification of an outline of a deal clearly marked \"INDICATION\".   Lesson learned.\n"
      ],
      "body": "\nI have attached a memo from Don Black regarding his meeting with Duke yesterday. As you will note,this memo outlines the factual differences between the parties. The legal issue is one straight out of first year Contracts class: Was there a meeting of the minds so as to create a binding contract? When I first looked at this I was somewhat concerned. In response to an email from Duke describing a particular index pricing, Julian responded simply \"I agree.\" But after talking to Don, Greg Whalley ,reviewing all the email correspondence, and, most importantly, listening to the trader tapes, I am convinced that Julian never agreed to the index that Duke is alleging. In other words I think we can make a good argument to get around   the damaging \" I agree\" email. It is clear that Duke's trader didn't, and probably still doesn't understand what index she was usingin her email. The Master Agreement provides for arbitration in Houston with three arbitrators, one of whom must have 8 years of experience in derivatives. I'll take my chances with that kind of panel. I estimate our liklihood of prevailing is in the 70-80% range. Let me know if you need anything further. ---"

Neither lists Enron Corp or any of its subsidiaries as a defendant.   Both cases are class actions.   Neither is a Qui Tam action.   The allegations are similar to those in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.The first, in Civil Action 9:999cv2555, was filed September 20, 1999.   The plaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.   The defendants are Mobil Oil Corporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Southeast, Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas &amp; New Mexico, Inc. and Mobil Exploration and Producing U.S. The second, Civil Action 9:000cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.   The plaintiffs are Melanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, WI.   The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration &amp; Production Company, Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&amp;P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading Company.Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing the plaintiffs in both cases.   Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming &amp; Asso. of Houston, signed the Stirman complaint.Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website at ww.edtx.uscourts.gov.   Enter the site and look under \"Frequently Requested Cases\".   You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsaker told me that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had   been dropped as defendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities were named in   Original and First Original Amended Complaints),   both are again named as defendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed on June 13, 2000.   The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the plaintiffs, had a conflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron and EOG to preserve the case.   That conflict has now been resolved.   The June 13 complaint is not yet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843. \n"

The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its undercollections.   (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass through the power purchase costs to customers.)The filing is apparently very large.   The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to us to make a copy for ourselves.Question to the lawyers:   Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?   Probably a good idea to have that filing passed around to this distribution list.Best,Jeff\n"

Recurring net income rose to $292 million or 34 cents per share from $2223 million or 27 cents in the third quarter of 1999. Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 32 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.\"Our wholesale and retail energy businesses have achieved record-setting levels of physical deliveries, contract originations and profitability,\" said Chairman and CEO Ken Lay. \"We operate in some of the largest and fastest growing markets in the world, and we are very optimistic about the continued strong outlook for our company,\" Lay added. Enron, which has recently branched out beyond energy into fields such as broadband telecommunications and metals trading, said third-quarter revenues rose 154 percent to $30 billion compared with the same period of 1999.

Oct. 16, 2000, 10:35PMArena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders By JANETTE RODRIGUES Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and civic-association members attended an informational meeting and get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. \"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it empowers us,\" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports Authority director. \"It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position.\" George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community. The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a repeat of the 1999 referendum. Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues. The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets the Hispanic community, Postolos said. The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is getting more tangibles this time around. He said, \"When you consider that our community will get 30 percent affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community.\" Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, heard the details of the plan for the first time. \"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild the community,\" she said. \"We want it to be good for the whole, not the few.\" Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. \"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs,\" Barrera said. Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos acknowledged that the team needs to do better.

TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its debt-reduction forecast. According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 2000. TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is under a court protective order. \"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,\" said David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility customers. But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the subject of the claim. TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman said Monday. In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA said Enron sought the court seal. The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest U.S. power producers. The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of 19998 and 1999. After the summer of 19998 - in which power that typically sells for between $30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward. Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across TVA's system. After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests. A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's requests were gathering dust. Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires, 202-862-66647, bryan.lee@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Oct. 16, 2000, 10:35PMArena-backers promote plan to group of Hispanic leaders By JANETTE RODRIGUES Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Pro-arena forces did some direct marketing to the Hispanic community Monday, pitching the $175 million plan to a grass-roots group of Latino leaders. More than 150 community activists and leaders, precinct judges and civic-association members attended an informational meeting and get-out-the-vote rally for the Nov. 7 arena referendum. The rally was sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. \"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it empowers us,\" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports Authority director. \"It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position.\" George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community. The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a repeat of the 1999 referendum. Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues. The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets the Hispanic community, Postolos said. The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is getting more tangibles this time around. He said, \"When you consider that our community will get 30 percent affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community.\" Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, heard the details of the plan for the first time. \"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild the community,\" she said. \"We want it to be good for the whole, not the few.\" Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. \"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs,\" Barrera said. Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos acknowledged that the team needs to do better.

The rally was sponsored by the Let's Build It Together political action committee. \"By having our Hispanic community come out in force for issues like this, it empowers us,\" said Celina Garza-Ridge, a Harris County-Houston Sports Authority director. \"It's very important to be able to say the Hispanic community made a difference, and we are exactly in that position.\" George Postolos, the Houston Rockets' chief operating officer, said the team is actively courting the Hispanic community. The pro-arena committee, headed by former Reliant Energy Chairman Don Jordan, and Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, does not want a repeat of the 1999 referendum. Voters last November soundly defeated the previous arena proposal. The sports authority is a governmental body whose members are appointed by the city and county to oversee and develop sports venues. The Rockets made a 30-percent participation commitment, similar to the one made four years ago by the Houston Astros for Enron Field, to fairly share the new arena's design and construction jobs with minorities and women. The team also promised to distribute up to $50,000 a year in neighborhood improvement grants of up to $1,000 each to worthy grass-roots, nonprofit organizations and civic clubs in inner-city Houston. The new program targets the Hispanic community, Postolos said. The new arena plan is being endorsed by a cross-section of Latino leaders, including City Councilmen John Castillo and Gabriel Vasquez, state Rep. Mario Gallegos, the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and others. Vasquez told meeting attendees that the city, and the Hispanic community, is getting more tangibles this time around. He said, \"When you consider that our community will get 30 percent affirmative action, that our youth will be taken care of through youth outreach programs and our neighborhoods will be taken care of as well, this is a really good deal for Houston and this is a really good deal for the Hispanic community.\" Mercedes Alejandro, who represents Parents for Public Schools of Houston, heard the details of the plan for the first time. \"It's good if it creates jobs for the community, and opportunities to rebuild the community,\" she said. \"We want it to be good for the whole, not the few.\" Humberto Barrera, president of the Mexican American Sheriffs Organization, was critical of Hispanic leaders, not the arena plan. \"I think Hispanic leaders should be more concerned about issues like pay raises for teachers, health care and public safety, than building arenas for rich entrepreneurs,\" Barrera said. Richard Torres, director and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told attendees that the Rockets are committed to doing the right thing. Sergio Davila, president of the Eastwood Civic Association, brought up the lack of Latinos in leadership positions on the team's staff. Postolos acknowledged that the team needs to do better.   TVA Says Enron Breach Of Power Sales Pact Cost $140 MlnBy Bryan Lee10/16/2000Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.)OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The nation's top two power providers are battling in a U.S. court over an unexecuted power sales agreement.The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has filed a claim against the power marketing unit of Enron Corp. (ENE) alleging breach of a power sales contract. TVA cited the alleged breach of contract in documents provided to its distribution utility customers earlier this month outlining unforeseen expenses contributing to the government-owned utility's inability to meet its debt-reduction forecast. According to the documents, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires, the alleged breach of contract contributed to a $140 million shortfall during fiscal year 2000. TVA was initially reluctant to divulge information on the case, which is under a court protective order. \"A major power provider elected not to perform under the contract,\" said David Smith, TVA's chief financial officer, when asked Friday to elaborate on the line item in the information provided to TVA's distribution utility customers. But after consulting with attorneys, Smith revealed that Enron was the subject of the claim. TVA alleged breach of contract after Enron sought a declaratory judgment order from the U.S. District Court in Chattanooga, Tenn., in February, stemming from a dispute over a long-term sales agreement, an Enron spokesman said Monday. In March, TVA filed a counter claim with the court alleging breach of contract, a TVA spokesman said Monday. But the two parties declined to discuss the terms of the contract, or to elaborate further on the dispute, citing the judge's protective order. TVA said Enron sought the court seal. The dispute is the latest example of bad blood between the Houston-based energy giant and TVA, a government-owned utility that ranks among the largest U.S. power producers. The relationship deteriorated after the two began squabbling over access to the lucrative U.S. Midwest power market, which saw extreme price spikes during hot weather in the summers of 19998 and 1999. After the summer of 19998 - in which power that typically sells for between $30 and $50 per megawatt-hour spiked as high as $7,000 per megawatt-hour - Enron cited a study showing that TVA's power grid represented the only unconstrained transmission pathways into the Midwest. TVA experienced an increase in revenues for the period when power prices were spiking upward. Enron built gas-fired peaking power plants with an eye toward capitalizing on the volatility in summer power markets by purchasing transmission access across TVA's system. After the summer of 1999 saw a repeat in extreme price volatility, Enron began complaining that TVA was unfairly denying transmission service by failing to act in a timely manner in response to transmission service requests. A TVA spokesman said the contract dispute was unrelated to the disagreement over the government utility's handling of transmission-access requests. But the filing of the court case occurred at the same time Enron went public with its complaints about TVA's transmission service. In February, Enron released a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asking for the government's help, charging that TVA was unfairly giving its own power marketer transmission service on a timely basis while Enron's requests were gathering dust. Enron later dropped the matter, saying that TVA was processing its transmission service requests on a timely basis. -By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones Newswires, 202-862-66647, bryan.lee@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Calpine Andy: To recap our conversation yesterday, here is where we stand on the Calpinematter. I made our settlement offer of $1 million to Tom Ganucheau by telephone onFriday, May 18. Tom told me that his client contact was out of the officeuntil May 23 or 24 but that he would relay the offer as quickly as he could.I spoke with Tom again by telephone last week and he volunteered that he was\"working on\" getting me a reply. We have had 3 minor successes in pretrial skirmishing that may make asettlement offer more attractive at this time. First, we won our motion tocompel, which requires that Calpine produce abstracts of all its powerpurchase and sale agreements in all NERC regions. They had moved for aprotective order which would limit their production to the contracts inERCOT. Their expanded production is due June 111. Second, we won our motionto continue or extend the deadline to reply to Calpine's motion for summaryjudgment. We filed a reply anyway out of an abundance of caution, but thecourt ruled that we were entitled to additional time, partly becasue of itsruling on expanding the scope of contract discovery outside ERCOT. Oursupplemental reply to the summary judgment motion is due June 222.   Third,Calpine lost on its motion to compel, in which they had sought an order fromthe court requiring us to produce additional information on our damageclaim. You should have a copy of our reply to Calpine's motion, in which wedetailed the evidence already produced on damages. We still need to updatesome of the damage claim based on information that came out in Ed Baughman'sdeposition, and Bonnie is working with Doug Gilbert-Smith on this. Elizabeth Sager's deposition is scheduled for June 13. Jim Fallon'sdeposition is scheduled for June 14. A prep session for Sager is scheduledfor June 7; a prep session for Fallon is scheduled for June 12. In additionto the pleading and discovery deadlines noted above, we also have a pleadingamendment deadline on June 20, and an expert report deadline of June 29. Wehave already met with Ron Vollmar about producing his expert report. We havedrafted an amended complaint, which we needed to do anyway since the casewas removed from state court and we were still on the state court originalpetition. The amended complaint will add a specific count pleadingambiguity/implied contract, to bolster the admissability of extrinsicevidence, and a promissory estoppel claim in the alternative. I will let you know as soon as I hear anything in response to oursettlement offer, and in the meantime, please don't hesitiate to call if youhave questions or comments on any of these matters. Best regards, Bill\n"

He was wanting me to participate in a 9:30am conference call this morning with his clients as the claims that they are getting the run around from the rental company and he was hoping we could do something as we were Mr. Van Scoyk's employer.I called him back and advised that Mr. Van Scoyk was not our employee, but rather an independent contractor who was performing Land Man services.   He wanted to know why he had an Enron North America business card, and that the number that was on it was to an ENA office in Denver, I believe.   He said that he certainly was holding himself out to be our employee.He said his clients have sustained both property damage, and loss of use for not being able to deliver propane; yet, he could not tell me if they have mitigated their damages by having the vehicle repaired (I find this strange since he is their agent).   I told him he needed to look to Enterprise (although Mr. Van Scoyk) did not purchase liability coverage, and after them, Mr. Van Scoyk's personal auto carrier.   He said Enterprise had no responsibility to handle this matter as he did not purchase any liability coverage.   Also, he intimated that the personal auto carrier for Mr. Van Scoyk has (or was in the process of) denying the claim since Mr. Van Scoyk was using the rental vehicle for \"business purposes\" (he also advised that Mr. Van Scoyk worked this area all the time, had used his personal auto in the process, but that it was in the shop that day for repairs).I advised Mr. Jensen to forward me whatever information he possessed that would assist me in this matter, to include a photocopy of the aforementioned business card.   Do you know if ENA obtains business cards for independent contractors such as Mr. Van Scoyk?   Is there any chance of obtaining the actual signed copy of the CONSULTING SERVICES AGREEMENT sent to Mr. Van Scoyk, short of going to his family?   Does anyone from ENA validate the insurance requirements of the aforementioned AGREEMENT, such as obtaining a copy of the pertinent declarations page or the policy itself for review?Who in the field can I discuss this matter with futher as I am interested in further exploring our relationship to Mr. Van Scoyk and would like to speak with someone first-hand.   Mr. Jensen was told to call me by a Ken Choice (Joyce?) or Jessica Winthrop when he called the number on Mr. Van Scoyk's business card.Your prompt attention to this matter would be appreciated.   I will forward to you whatever is faxed to me by Mr. Jensen.Thanks,Rob\n"

I am Marty Sunde's assistant and I am writing regarding the 111/222/000 letter from Palmer, Guest &amp; Esses regarding Euell Energy Resources.   The letter was addressed to Mr. Lay and Marty Sunde in EES received a copy.   We sent the letter to our General Counsel, Vicki Sharp, who advises that she passed it on to you for handling.   As the 12/15/000 deadline (set forth in Mr. Esses' letter) is approaching, I thought I would follow up to see if a response has been provided to them.   If this has already been taken care of, would you be so kind as to fax a copy of the letter to us for our file.   Our fax number is (713) 646-21999.Please let me know.   Thank you.\n"

EGP, et al. Gentlemen:As I mentioned in my earlier e-mail of this morning, I attach the latest versions of the letter to ExxonMobil and the chronology.   Again, I have deliberately softened the tone in the last paragraph of page 2 of the letter to wire around a potential problem caused by a 19995 letter from us to Mobil in the past about the role of ELSC.   We have also redrafted both the letter and chronology to reflect that the ELP, LP was a publicly traded company, so KN acquired only Enron's interest in it, not all of it.   We last redrafted the chronology to reflect that the partnership never actually owned the hydrocarbon recovery plant.Mike has briefly reviewed these drafts and I understand has no problem with them (although I am resending them to him for him to review again if he wishes).   Jim and Richard, once I have your respective comments/go ahead, I will send this to Eric Nichols by telefax this afternoon.   I will also give Nichols a heads-up that it is coming.I await your response.Britt \n"

Curtiss [mailto:randmcurtiss@juno.com]Sent: Thursday, August 24, 2000 10:15 AMTo: barbara.rayner@ey.com; jfrizzell@gibbs-bruns.com;mtimberlake@worldnet.att.net; Scollings@gibbs-bruns.com;thill@mcfallglidden.comSubject: Appraisers' conference call results and next stepsBarbara Rayner and her team, Marlene Timberlake and her team (except forMalcolm, who was unfortunately not available) and Randy teleconferencedthis morning as scheduled.   Here is what resulted:1. We all think we can have values ready by Friday 8/31, but not fullreports which explain how we got to them and which are in formatssuitable for submission.   We need perhaps another week (but not a greatdeal longer) to have suitable reports completed.   We believe this willnot be too much of a problem, based on Barbara's and Marlene'sdiscussions with respective counsels.2. We all appear to be missing financial statements for Beal's Town carfor the year 19997.   Could Scarlett see if they are available and get themto us?3. There was minor confusion regarding Call Center as to which financialforecast should be used.   There are at least three, but they are notappreciably different.   Rand used the forecast accompanying the DASH.Scarlett might want to double check to see which one is appropriate, ifthis can be determined.   Not a major issue.3. With regard to Tim's letter of 8/16 and Scarlett's response on 8/18:A. None of us were influenced in any way by the Enron valuation numberssubmitted along with the Enron materials.   We are each preparing anindependent opinion.B. On the Call Center interest, we will all address the issue of thewarrants: Rand pointed out that the warrants did not all vestimmediately, and that the 95.58% ownership assumption would incorrectlyreflect this.   I believe we all agreed that 82.3% is the proper ownershipinterest as of 9/5/999, subject to revisiting the issue independently.C. Everyone is treating Cynet as a separate item.   We all agree thatthere is a legal issue as to whether an investment was made as of thevaluation date.   That is not an appraisal issue.D. On the final accounting and the formula calculations, we would allike the attorneys to explain to us exactly how these are to be treated.Rand in particular is unclear as to how the final calculation should bedone.   We can discuss this at our Monday conference call, which Rand willset up (through AT&amp;T: they will call each of us) at 2:000 P.M. easterntime, 1:000 Dallas.4. We were unanimous in deciding that now is not the right time to shareresults for several reasons:A. We do not want to do anything that would contravene the PartnershipAgreement which might cause all of our good work (editorial comment!) tobe tossed out.B. Sharing of \"numbers only\" results without final reports giving theirrationales is useless.C. If we were to share \"everything but the conclusions\" now, we mightwaste a great deal of time and money on minutiae, irrelevant things, orarguments about issues on which appraisers can have legitimatedifferences of opinion.We propose instead the following:A. We will each prepare reports and submit them as soon as possible(relative to the 8/31 goal) as planned.   We will each submit full reportsthat detail how we developed our conclusions, as well as what they are.B. Counsels can then decide what they would like to do.   If they wish toaccept our reports and proceed, we are done.   If counsels agreealternatively that they would like the appraisers to exchange reports, weare equally amenable to that.   Each of us could then read the otherreports and (assuming counsels authorize this) reconsider our ownconclusions and revise them (if warranted) and/or comment on the othersin a constructive manner.   Again, we do not want to do anything thatwould jeopardize the validity of what we have accomplished so far, but weall want to cooperate to get this matter resolved.I will talk with you all on Monday afternoon.Rand M.

Shortly after that, I received a call from Oaktree's General Counsel reminding me of Enron's responsibilities under the Release.? You may get a call also, from either Ken Liang or Brian Berman.In the meantime, as you will see from the attached draft, we have discovered that the Release it clearly provides that Oaktree will not disclose anything it learns from Enron to it co-plaintiff Farallon.? Given that, how can Hennegan interview Brian---is he promising not to tell his client Farallon what he learns on behalf of his client Oaktree???

EES will take its oldest backup tape as a snapshot of the email&lt; system as it then existed.   EES will not be making daily backups of the&lt; email system.

EES will not be making&lt; any other backups of file server data other than they normally would in&lt; the ordinary course of business&lt;&lt; 3. EES will not be taking copies or mirror images of the 3000 employees&lt; hard drives and any associated floppy disks at this time.   Employees will&lt; continue to use their equipment as they normally would.&lt;&lt; 4.

(collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron Energy Marketing&lt; Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland&lt; General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")&lt;&lt; Harvey,&lt;&lt;   Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'&lt; production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued&lt; by the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the&lt; Commission\").   The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in&lt; undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric&lt; markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis.   We&lt; believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to&lt; commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to&lt; litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,&lt; which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of&lt; pages of documents.   We make these proposals pursuant to our email&lt; exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission&lt; agrees that by cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents,&lt; the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these&lt; subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses, objections,&lt; jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically&lt; reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.   For all of these&lt; proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the&lt; attorney client and attorney work product privileges.&lt;&lt;   Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents&lt; for year 2000 as noted below.   We also understand that the Commission will&lt; be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to&lt; duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.&lt; As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for&lt; production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron&lt; Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in&lt; wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.   Thus, the documents&lt; offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron&lt; Energy Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.   We also do&lt; not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.&lt;&lt; GENERAL DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 1 through 4&lt;&lt;   Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the&lt; burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate&lt; organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 19998&lt; is significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with&lt; exemplars of their current organizational charts, telephone directories&lt; and so called \"family trees\" to show its current organization.   To the&lt; extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars&lt; of significant organizational charts, telephone directories or so called&lt; \"family trees\" for earlier periods they will also make those available.&lt; One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its corporate&lt; history.   If a list of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.&lt; With respect to the other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate&lt; histories can be found, they will be produced.   We anticipate producing&lt; these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.&lt;&lt; Requests 5 and 6&lt;&lt;   The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will&lt; identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction&lt; Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.   We believe this&lt; information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the&lt; staff's purposes.&lt;&lt; FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 7 through 111&lt;&lt;   The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period&lt; requested with respect to financial data.   EPMI, EES, and Portland General&lt; will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the&lt; \"Transaction Documents\") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered&lt; which information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public&lt; filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic&lt; Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.&lt;&lt; GENERATING DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 12, 14 and 18&lt;&lt;   For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation&lt; facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will&lt; probably be limited documents available.   The Enron Entities to the extent&lt; they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or&lt; resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain&lt; to each generation unit requested.   The Enron Entities, other than&lt; Portland General, do have documents and information for Las Vegas&lt; Cogeneration.   We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of&lt; document productions.&lt;&lt;   For Portland General, the production of the requested documents&lt; would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned&lt; twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.&lt; Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about&lt; one half of its total energy demand.   As a result, we question whether the&lt; effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the&lt; California wholesale market is necessarily limited.   Nevertheless,&lt; Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction&lt; Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other&lt; Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.   We propose&lt; that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until&lt; it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant&lt; proportion of their energy into the California market.   At that time a&lt; more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will&lt; be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the&lt; California wholesale market.&lt;&lt; TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19&lt;&lt;   We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for&lt; the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and&lt; PX.   EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant&lt; transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California&lt; and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the&lt; date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it&lt; is a purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this&lt; information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or&lt; inaccurate.   For those&lt; transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we&lt; understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will&lt; not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide&lt; quickly.   The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to&lt; EPMI's customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading&lt; business.   EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant&lt; wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to&lt; retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail&lt; customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'&lt; confidentiality obligations to those customers.   We anticipate producing&lt; the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.&lt;&lt; FERC DOCUMENTS&lt;&lt; Request 20&lt;&lt;   The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received&lt; from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of&lt; those responses.   We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October&lt; 13, 2000.&lt;&lt;&lt;   Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron&lt; Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on&lt; Friday October 27, 2000.   It is possible that not all Enron Entities could&lt; make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for&lt; production by then.&lt;&lt;   We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if&lt; any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one&lt; currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions&lt; will be protected by the most stringent protective order.   In addition,&lt; if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the&lt; Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests&lt; for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities&lt; reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with&lt; such order.&lt;&lt;   We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know&lt; if they are acceptable to the Commission.

(collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron Energy Marketing&lt; Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland&lt; General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")&lt;&lt; Harvey,&lt;&lt;   Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'&lt; production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued&lt; by the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the&lt; Commission\").   The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in&lt; undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric&lt; markets by producing the information specified on a timely basis.   We&lt; believe that the production we propose will enable the Commission to&lt; commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to&lt; litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,&lt; which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of&lt; pages of documents.   We make these proposals pursuant to our email&lt; exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission&lt; agrees that by cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents,&lt; the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these&lt; subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses, objections,&lt; jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically&lt; reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary.   For all of these&lt; proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the&lt; attorney client and attorney work product privileges.&lt;&lt;   Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documents&lt; for year 2000 as noted below.   We also understand that the Commission will&lt; be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to&lt; duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.&lt; As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for&lt; production, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of Enron&lt; Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in&lt; wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.   Thus, the documents&lt; offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron&lt; Energy Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.   We also do&lt; not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.&lt;&lt; GENERAL DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 1 through 4&lt;&lt;   Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the&lt; burden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporate&lt; organizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 19998&lt; is significant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with&lt; exemplars of their current organizational charts, telephone directories&lt; and so called \"family trees\" to show its current organization.   To the&lt; extent that the Enron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars&lt; of significant organizational charts, telephone directories or so called&lt; \"family trees\" for earlier periods they will also make those available.&lt; One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its corporate&lt; history.   If a list of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.&lt; With respect to the other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate&lt; histories can be found, they will be produced.   We anticipate producing&lt; these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.&lt;&lt; Requests 5 and 6&lt;&lt;   The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will&lt; identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction&lt; Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.   We believe this&lt; information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the&lt; staff's purposes.&lt;&lt; FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 7 through 111&lt;&lt;   The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period&lt; requested with respect to financial data.   EPMI, EES, and Portland General&lt; will provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the&lt; \"Transaction Documents\") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered&lt; which information includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public&lt; filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic&lt; Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.&lt;&lt; GENERATING DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 12, 14 and 18&lt;&lt;   For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation&lt; facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will&lt; probably be limited documents available.   The Enron Entities to the extent&lt; they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or&lt; resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain&lt; to each generation unit requested.   The Enron Entities, other than&lt; Portland General, do have documents and information for Las Vegas&lt; Cogeneration.   We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of&lt; document productions.&lt;&lt;   For Portland General, the production of the requested documents&lt; would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned&lt; twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.&lt; Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about&lt; one half of its total energy demand.   As a result, we question whether the&lt; effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the&lt; California wholesale market is necessarily limited.   Nevertheless,&lt; Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction&lt; Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other&lt; Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.   We propose&lt; that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until&lt; it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant&lt; proportion of their energy into the California market.   At that time a&lt; more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will&lt; be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the&lt; California wholesale market.&lt;&lt; TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS&lt; Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19&lt;&lt;   We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for&lt; the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and&lt; PX.   EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant&lt; transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California&lt; and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the&lt; date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it&lt; is a purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this&lt; information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or&lt; inaccurate.   For those&lt; transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we&lt; understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will&lt; not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide&lt; quickly.   The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to&lt; EPMI's customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading&lt; business.   EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant&lt; wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to&lt; retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail&lt; customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'&lt; confidentiality obligations to those customers.   We anticipate producing&lt; the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.&lt;&lt; FERC DOCUMENTS&lt;&lt; Request 20&lt;&lt;   The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received&lt; from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of&lt; those responses.   We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October&lt; 13, 2000.&lt;&lt;&lt;   Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron&lt; Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on&lt; Friday October 27, 2000.   It is possible that not all Enron Entities could&lt; make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for&lt; production by then.&lt;&lt;   We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if&lt; any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one&lt; currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions&lt; will be protected by the most stringent protective order.   In addition,&lt; if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the&lt; Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests&lt; for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities&lt; reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with&lt; such order.&lt;&lt;   We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know&lt; if they are acceptable to the Commission.   If you have any questions or&lt; comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day&lt; or myself.&lt;&lt; Brobeck Phleger &amp; Harrison LLP&lt;&lt; Gary Fergus&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

The actual financingclosed in December of 1999.   It turned out that HEOF THEN (not before)invested not only the $2.2 million that was in escrow as of the valuationdate but an additional $2220,000.I think the valuation implications are obvious.I took the liberty of handling this directly with Greg; if you have anyother questions, please feel free to call him.This just leaves Creole Shack (Roland Curry) who has never gotten back tome, and we are done with our calls and can proceed to finalize ourreports.Rand M.

Tom Nicholas advises that the Wrightgroup would like the meeting to be held February 27-28 in Houston,rather than Denver.   Jay Barrymore would prefer the meeting be heldMarch 5-6 in Denver.   Clay Latimer is available February 27-28 and wouldprefer the meeting be held in Denver.   I was unable to reach Clay thisafternoon to determine if March 5-6 would work for him.   We haveconfirmed availability among hotels in downtown Denver to host foreither date window.   Some of the Wright folks are reportedly checking onavailability of Houston hotels for February 27-28.   The Kansas SteeringCommittee is meeting by phone tomorrow morning, and we will need to cometo a final decision in the next day or two on which to base meetingplans.   Wright lead defense counsel are concentrated in Houston, and soit might make sense for the Wright group to meet independently and in adifferent location; however, there are a number of counsel who will needto attend both meetings, so the meetings probably should not be at thesame time in different cities.   Thus far, we have not announced plans toany of the JDT groups at large.Dawne M. Davis, CLALegal AssistantHolland &amp; HartP.O.

The liquidation proceeding is anattempt to recover approximately $250 million Edison is in default on toCalPX market participants.Davis' Executive Order nullifies a Los Angeles County Superior Courtdecision that earlier today authorized CalPX to liquidate Edison's forwardmarket positions. The following is excerpt from Governor Davis' ExecutiveOrder: It is ordered that the contracts and trades in the market for thesales and purchases of forward contracts and trades for electricity (knownas the \"Block Forward\" market) for the delivery of electricity possessed bySouthern California Edison Company*is hereby commandeered by the State ofCalifornia to be held subject to the control and coordination of the Stateof California.CalPX will transfer the Edison contracts to the State of California. Statelaw requires that the state shall pay \"the reasonable value thereof,\" andbased on competitive market conditions today, CalPX determined the value ofthese contracts, for 2,846,000 megawatt hours, at over $651 million.- 30 -CalPX is a non-profit public benefit corporation established in 19998 withthe passage of AB1890, which restructured the electric utility industrywithin the state of California.Richard C.

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times whenhardcopies are made or needed for running our business.   Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1.   The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice.   If space becomes a problem, please contactDebra Davidson who can arrange for storage.2.   What constitutes a document?   In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean.   For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved.   Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document.   On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well.   Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3.   The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hardcopies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesaleelectricity market litigation.   If hard copy documents are discarded, at alater point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized forfailingto preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.4.   Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages fromfriends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by thispolicyand you may do with them as you wish.===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the&lt; topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete&lt; any email sent or received for 24 hours.   Email that is personal and does&lt; not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept,&lt; discarded etc. at the employee's pleasure.   Each day there is a backup&lt; made that will capture the email in those employees mailboxes.   After 24&lt; hours, each employee is free to manage their email box as they deem&lt; appropriate to the business needs (e.g. keep, discard).   From our&lt; conversation, I understand that you agree that this is an acceptable&lt; procedure.&lt;&lt; 2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would&lt; like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to&lt; discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest&lt; Drive Image Pro 4.0.   In addition, there may be some other individuals&lt; that you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to&lt; copy files from their hard drives onto the network.   Until we figure out&lt; which computers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.   We discussed&lt; that because of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this&lt; started until after the new year.&lt;&lt; 3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along&lt; business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of&lt; your request.   We propose not to backup any other business units or&lt; functions.   On a going forward basis, those business functions that&lt; related to the subject matter of your request would be instructed not to&lt; delete business email.&lt;&lt; 4. We believe that relevant database   backups have been and will&lt; continue to be made and preserved.&lt;&lt; 5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it&lt; is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the&lt; network (where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files&lt; to make sufficient work space for the employee to work.&lt;&lt; 6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do&lt; not have as detailed information immediately available.&lt;&lt; As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being&lt; made are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron&lt; entities may have to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction,&lt; relevance, privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically&lt; reserves each and every right and objection it or its employees may have.&lt;&lt; Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is&lt; different than the above.&lt;&lt; Thanks&lt; Gary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Kay Chapman another assistant on the floor said it used to be monitored by Hub Gavela (sp?) but he is no longer here.   We called the service number on the fax to see if we could get a \"poll\" report listing all the faxes that have come in and found out this particular machine only has memory for the last 10 faxes.   I have called Lucent (the telephone people) and with approval from my manager they can give me a phone report of all the incoming phone numbers to that machine since September 1st.

Anderson, et al. vs. EGLI (ENA)This will acknowledge receipt of the above.   This will be handled as an insurance-related matter, subject to any objections by our reinsurer, to which we would not anticipate.   The allegations give rise to a \"products\" claim, and as such, pollution related exclusionary language would not be applicable.   Thus, we will defend the entire lawsuit, and indemnify with the exception of any settlement/award for damages associated with the count of \"FRAUDULENT CONCEALMENT\" as such constitutes \"intentional\" conduct as opposed to an \"accident\".   I trust you will advise the operating company accordingly.Eileen, please advise as to who you suggest we retain in this matter.   Perhaps other firms have been retained by the other defendants to which we could share in a cost-sharing agreement.   Additionally, it is critical for us to determine our involvement and any sale dates of product given that the lawsuit is silent as to the time period involved here. The involved time period will have an impact on how claim payments will be allocated.Thanks,Rob\n"

Ecogas Corp.Britt and Bonnie:As I discussed with Britt this morning, I represent Furlow Services, Inc., which is owed substantial sums under two general construction contracts with Ecogas Corp., one in Dallas (the McCommas Landfill) and the other in San Antonio (Nelson Gardens Landfill).   (There are two \"Ecogas Corp.\"s, one a Texas corp. and one a Delaware corp. It appears that Furlow's contracts are with the Delaware corporation, but I have not been able to fully verify that.)Tom Hall, the general cousel of Ecogas (512/347-14441), tells us, in general terms, that Ecogas has been acquired by Enron (ECT, I think) and that we will get paid when Enron puts up the money.   Mr. Hall has mentioned that his contact at Enron is John Lambert.   I called Mr. Lambert yesterday, but have not yet received a response. Mr. Hall also disputes our invoices, although we have not been able to get him to set out his disputes in any detail.I have been corresponding with Mr. Hall, trying to get this worked out, since August of this year, and we are now at an impasse.   Furlow Services has filed mechanic's liens and desires to file suit.   I have prepared lawsuits for recovery of the Furlow accounts on the two projects and to foreclose its liens on those projects.There are two reasons why I am contacting you before filing the lawsuits:   1.   I need to verify what (if any) relationship there is between Ecogas and Enron.   Since I have represented other Enron subsidiaries, and would like to continue to do so, I will not file any lawsuit against Enron or any of its subsidiaries.   If we confirm that Ecogas really is an Enron subsidiary, whether direct or indirect, then I will obtain new counsel for Furlow Services on this dispute.   2.   Since Enron regularly pays its bills, something doesn't seem right about this entire scenario if Enron has in fact acquired Ecogas.   If Enron does have responsibility for Ecogas' construction costs, perhaps this all can be worked out in a meeting rather than a lawsuit.   If I can facilitate working this out, and if both Furlow and Enron consent to my continuing to play a role in settlement discussions, I would continue to represent Furlow solely for purposes of settlement discussions.   I sincerely appreciate your help on this matter.   I know it is hard to get anything done this week, and I will be leaving this afternoon for the Thanksgiving holiday.   No lawsuits will be filed this week, and I will follow up with you next week before taking any action.   In the meantime, thanks again and have a great holiday!\n"

(\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and EnronEnergy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation(\"Portland General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"EnronEntities\")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing the information specified on a timely basis.   We believe that thelimited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence itsinvestigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all ofthe potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by anystandard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have notwaived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and thatany claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or otherresponses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that areprotected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work productprivileges. Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documentsfor year 2000 as noted below.   We also understand that the Commission willbe obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here toduplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.As you will see in the general documents that are offered here forproduction, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of EnronEnergy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage inwholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.   Thus, the documentsoffered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron EnergyServices, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.   We also do notpropose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, theburden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporateorganizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 19998 issignificant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplarsof their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called\"family trees\" to show its current organization.   To the extent that theEnron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significantorganizational charts, telephone directories or so called \"family trees\" forearlier periods they will also make those available.   One Enron Entity,Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.   If a listof those books would be helpful, we can provide it.   With respect to theother Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,they will be produced.   We anticipate producing these documents in the firstwave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.   We believe thisinformation will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for thestaff's purposes.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 111 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.   EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the\"Transaction Documents\") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered whichinformation includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filingsregarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic TransactionDocuments in the second wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there willprobably be limited documents available.   The Enron Entities to the extentthey act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resellgeneration output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to eachgeneration unit requested.   The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.   We propose toproduce these documents in the second wave of document productions.   For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.   As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.   In addition, thosetransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California arelimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two smallCalifornia municipal utilities.   Thus, the Commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO andPX.   Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of otherinformation until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell asignificant proportion of their energy into the California market.   At thattime a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effortwill be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation onthe California wholesale market.TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevanttransaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California andReal Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is apurchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want thisinformation, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete orinaccurate.   For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI'scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.   EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevantwholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect toretail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retailcustomers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'confidentiality obligations to those customers.   We anticipate producing theTransaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.   We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.   It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.   In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.

I think the danger of allowing the Quinn Emmanuel firm to get involved far outweighs the benefit of getting a release. The release may be shortlived.   Enron could be added to Quinque or a Quinque copycat by another Plaintiffs atty. Furthurmore, their involvement in Quinque could result in the development of evidence adverse to our position in the Grynberg case. What are your thoughts?---"

I have copied only the three principle people (Eric, Ben, Mark) involved in analyzing the complaints, gathering information in support of your legal research, and responding accordingly.A few comments:1.   A third party analysis (Southwest Research Institute - - SWRI) showed no abnormal noise within the hearing range.2.   SWRI showed that at 25 Hz there is a louder than expected vibration.   This is well below the hearing range.   There are no vendor, regulatory, or otherwise, specifications for vibrations in this range.   The fleet of 501 FD's is too small to get any historical data on this range.3.   SWRI indicated that one possible source could be the water injection system in the combustor.   We have informed the turbine vendor (Siemens Westinghouse - - SWPC) of this and asked that they work with us to resolve the following: a.   Is there a problem b.   If there is a problem, what can be done to completely correct the cause of it. c.   Barring (b), what can be done to mitigate the effect of the possible problem (damping material in the stack, etc).4.   Since we instrumented and tested (by SWRI), we have not had significant run time.5.   Mark Dobler and I are meeting with SWPC in Orlando on Monday of next week to hammer out the detailed plan.6.   The run season is coming to an end, and I expect fewer than 16 total run hours before next January.7.   We are working to resolve whether there is a problem, and if so to correct it; however, since this is a new generation machine, any efforts have to be coordinated with the OEM (SWPC); therefore, an expeditious My instinct is to explain to the press and the neighbors fully what we are doing, but I want to make sure that we don't put ourselves in any legal jeopardy.   Advice? I suggest a meeting with all concerned if you have significant comments/advice.Mitch---",

The press release provides: \"Theagenda will include \"unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power.\"Williams is concerned about attending such a meeting of competitors withoutthe presence of antitrust counsel even under the sponsorship of the Governor(who presumably acts as both the sovereign and on behalf of the buyer(s))).We are looking into the Sovereign immunity and Noerr-Pennington issues todetermine how best to protect any such group discussions from challenge oras evidence in any of the pending cases.   Are any of your clients alsoconcerned about this and are you also looking into these issues?Williams would like to have a joint defense protected conference call(perhaps later today if possible) to discuss this meeting and considerwhether antitrust counsel is needed for the group or if each participantshould attend with its own counsel.   Please let me have your thoughts andwhether one of you (or other counsel) is interested and available toparticipate in a conference call.   Thanks/Jeffrey M.

We are well past thedeadlines Sprint asked us to comply with (February 25 forprivate sites and March 1 for public sites).   At this stage,adding new sites to such a large, nationwidevideoconference is extraordinarily burdensome, requiringSprint to move the entire conference to a different bridgingsystem, change the dial-in numbers, etc.   Also of importanceis the fact that the bridging system has space limitations.Please e-mail me with all videoconference requests no laterthan 12 p.m. Mountain tomorrow (Friday, March 10).   After thenoon cutoff, we will no longer be able to entertain additionalvideoconference requests.   In the meantime, I will do mybest to accommodate the late requests we've received.I will be sending out a detailed memo tomorrow afternoonthat lists all the sites that have been booked, along withthose who've made reservations.   Each of you planning tovideoconference will need to check carefully to be sure yourreservation is reflected in my memo.   In addition, many ofthe sites have extremely limited seating, so please do notplan to show up at a public site without a reservation.Thanks to all of you for your consideration.Dawne DavisLegal AssistantHolland &amp; HartP.O.

No one over here seems to know what that project is, but your name appears on some of the correspondence.Looking at the backup for the invoice did shed a bit of light though, because some of it mentions charterers liability I vaguely remember from my EGLI days (too many years ago) that the Havmann was an LPG tanker.   Is it the same ship?Can you let me know how this issue relates to Apachi, and what project it is.

I have received, and will shortly send to you, a letter from our underwriters' counsel, confirming the settlement.   Payment will be made within twenty-one days, which means before year-end.   Our barrister and expert have been advised to stop work immediately.   Parenthetically, we were able to avoid becoming liable for the 7,5000 pound advance to our barrister that would have otherwise come due last Friday.Let me know if you want me to participate in a conference with John Nowlan to explain our reasons for the settlement.   By the way, this finally wraps up all the M/V HAVMANN arbitration/litigation.   Best advises that there is no one left for us to pursue, and no one left who is pursuing us.One question:   Best wants to know if you want the $475,000 to come directly to us, or to come to him, and to be disbursed to us by him net of agreed fees and expenses that we owe.   One way or another, I assume that you ultimately want the money wired to us, but I wonder if you know of a person (or department) from whom to determine the proper wire transfer account/address.   If not, I am sure that I can find out.   Thanks.Britt\n"

I am also forwarding personal resumes for two of my partners,   John Lacy and Mark Desmarais, both of whom do maritime work.? For reasons   discussed hereinbelow, I suggest that Mark and his associate, Randy Baldemor,   would be best suited to work on this matter.? The billing rates for Mark   and Randy are $245/hour and?$130/hour, respectively.?Two issues   turned up during our conflict check.? First, our firm represents Hawaiian   Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) and its subsidiaries, including its three public   utility subsidiaries, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), Hawaii Electric   Light Company, Inc. (HELCO) and Maui Electric Company, Limited (MECO).?   Although we are not aware on any actual conflict between ENRON and HEI, HECO,   HELCO or MECO, we are cognizant that ENRON is a major player in the power   producing industry.? Accordingly, we would need to confirm that our   representation of ENRON in the present maritime matter would not preclude us   from representing HEI, HECO, HELCO or MECO in other matters in which such   companies' interests may be adverse to ENRON.? Please let me know as soon   as possible whether this arrangement is acceptable.?Second, as it   turns out, Mark Desmarais and Randy Baldemor having been tracking the M/V OBOD   and reporting back to a Seattle Washington law firm.? The Seattle firm   retained our firm strictly to monitor the vessel and any actions with regard to   her arrest, but has neither asked for legal advice, nor disclosed who their   client is.? Mark does not believe that our firm's monitoring the status of   the vessel presents any conflicts with our representing ENRON.? He has   placed a call to the Seattle firm and expects?to hear back from his contact   later this afternoon.? Assuming our firm is engaged by ENRON, given that   they already know about the vessel, its recent history and the parties and   counsel involved, Mark and Randy would appear best suited to assist you on this   matter.?Finally, I   passed on to Mark your immediate concern that ENRON should not be viewed   (because it missed a filing deadline or otherwise) as having abandoned its   interest in the cargo of the M/V OBOD.?

ECT sent its insurance claim letter out to Underwriters' adjusters in this matter last week.   No reply has yet been received.   We will monitor. 2.   Mitsubishi has not pushed its demurrage claim of about $260,000.   Our solicitor, David Best, has had confirmed by our barrister that our time-bar defense against the demurrage claim is strong. 3.   We are paying joint testing invoices 1000% and submitting them for 50 % reimbursement to Mitsubishi.   So far, despite its agreement to do so, Mitsubishi has not reimbursed us at all.   We suspect that if we push this, Mitsubishi will start threatening to start up with the demurrage claim again.   At least until we find out what Underwriters' position will be, we do not suggest pushing Mitsubishi on this. I will keep you advised. Britt\n"

Jon Mostel, our principal transactions lawyer who has been working for more than a year with East Coast Power on the contract with Tosco (i.e., Bayway Refining Company), has been instrumental in providing the factual, legal and regulatory predicates for the East Coast deal and how Infineum fits into or is affected by that.

I will send a copy of this to you for your review. I am not familiar with Freshfield's billing practices generally or whether ECT has any agreement with Freshfield's for providing specific billing formats.

The reason is simple:   the market has moved and they failed to act quickly.3. All markets,pet coke markets in particular, are time sensitive.   Because Votorantim has delayed in the execution of final   documents, it accepted the risk that, over time, market prices would change and Enron would no longer be willing to sign a deal.4. Again, we never had a final, enforceable deal. Their only claim is that we misrepresented to them our willingness to do the deal and therefor they didn't pursue negotiations with a third party. Our response is: we never made any misrepresetation and it is not reasonable to   rely on our negotiations as a basis to forego discussions with third parties when Enron never sent them a binding offer.\n"

Lawyers for the other plaintiffs will begin tomorrow.? Izower was a first-year lawyer at White &amp; Case when he began working on the NSM offering in Oct. 19997.? The senior White &amp; Case lawyers who worked on the deal have either changed firms or retired.Highlights: ---Hatch spent much of the morning on the off-take agreements and their description in the offering memo.? Izower strongly defended offering memo's description of the off-take agreements as accurate but would not cooperate with Hatch when asked to point out where in the off-take agreements Preussag or Klockner were \"obligated\" to purchase NSM's steel.? Izower's counsel objected to the questions as calling for a legal conclusion.? ---Hatch walked Izower through the various drafts of the off-take agreements and asked if Izower had discussed the changes with the \"underwriting group.\"? Izower testified that most of the comments were received from Gleacher Natwest, McDonald, Cravath and SDI.? Izower produced a responsibility schedule concerning certain documents related to the offering with completion dates.? Enron/ECT is not mentioned in the document as having had any role in the drafting although Izower did mention, as an afterthought, that Enron and Paine Webber may also have provided comments on the off-take agreements.---Hatch established that the offering memo failed to disclose the existence of certain material agreements such as: a)??? Employment agreements between NSM and Swasdi Horrungruang and NSM and Chamni Janchai (who was thought of as being a crook) pursuant to which they received an annual salary of $350,000 for ten years;b)??? A Throughput Agreement between Sriracha Harbor and NSM pursuant to which NSM offering proceeds would be diverted to the Harbor (which Swasdi had an ownership interest in) and to certain Thai banks who were owed sums from the Harbor.? Apparently, the Thai banks were threatening a foreclosure and take over of the Harbor jeopardizing NSM's ability to import and export materials.? The payment sums are not disclosed.? In less than convincing fashion, Izower indicated that the agreement was probably not mentioned in the offering memo as it may not have qualified as \"related party transaction.\"---Izower had no idea why the legal, financial and advisory fees on the NSM deal had increased from $29 million to $35 million.This e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information.

I suggest that since the dispute resolution procedure envisages continuity, until resolution, that Consumers should continue to invoice on the basis that they have done for the last few years. Richard, we will need your input as to whether we could argue the above with a sufficient degree of confidence to persuade a judge to make an order of specific performance as against Consumers to invoice using the basis that they have been using for the last few years, pending outcome of the dispute resolution process. Further, whether you believe that we will be entitled to seek such equitable relief. We need to take control of this process and ensure that Consumers are always playing catch-up, if we fail to do so we will be playing catch-up and will be out of pocket until the conclusion of the arbitration process. If we do not get Consumers to invoice and pay the sums we believe are due, there will be no incentive on Consumers to start the process and every opportunity for them to delay any resolution of this dispute. I have spoken with Sandy Hollingsworth who will be sending me copies of documents that Dynegy have uncovered which she believes further assist our case. Once I receive them we ought to meet to review and obtain a better understanding of the case we are able to make and the case which may be made against us. Is there any other evidence that we, or Dynegy, should be collecting at this stage, such as interviewing individuals who were involved in the negotiations/discussions with Consumers?

He was a very small time lawyer outin La Mesa (the sticks) with a general practice that   included litigation.He was a family law judge until he was made an overflow general civil judgein 19998.   None of the lawyers whom I have listed would be likely to have arelationship with him from their days in practice.   Also, he may not keepthe case, given its high profile, and the fact that it is related to thecase filed against the generators, which has a lower number.   People whoknow Judge Meyer say he is pompous and not very bright.He practiced with three lawyers. One of them went on the bench and is nowretired.   Another has also retired.   The remaining one is LeRoy Knutson, whois of counsel in a small firm in El Cajon, also the sticks.ThanksGary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday morning in San Diego.Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold in the state. An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable to comment. The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

As you know IwasCarrin Patman's paralegal for several years over at Bracewell &amp; Patterson andIam hoping that I might be able to use the two of you as references should Ibe contacted regarding the positions I've applied for.Richard, in the Beeson matter I see that the Supreme Court rendered adecision in Intratex's favor regarding the necessity of a new trial ifthe Plaintiffs attempt to recertify the class. As I assume you are aware, Iwas the person in charge of assembling and organizing all 12000 boxes ofdocuments relating to the various Intratex, HPL, Atapco, Beeson and Millsmatters and assisted Carrin and Neal Manne in many of the court appearances.I believe that this experience can be very useful if I were to work for Enron.Michelle, even though I only had an opportunity to work on a couple of yourprojects while you were at B&amp;P, I did have an opportunity to assist you andothers at Enron with the urgent project to produce employment records to theFTC last fall. I really enjoyed working with you and would like to do soagain.Any assistance you can offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated.Susan M.

We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.1. Corporacion Nacional del   Cobre de Chile (\"Codelco\" )   v.   MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCCThis is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter &amp; May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal.Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 20001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public. - LT0108100084_3.doc2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National CorporationClaim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde &amp; Co.3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing HouseClaim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses believed to be US$8000,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar inapplicable). This has led to resumption of settlement negotiations with Standard Chartered Bank (trading), who put the metal onto warrant originally (and against whom the LCH would have an indemnity claim). The most recent offer from Standard Chartered is to pay US$437,000; but this is subject to unacceptable conditions. Solicitors: Allen &amp; Overy.4. Nickel explosion in furnace in Cleveland: Scandia Transport   LMEWarehouse/LCH/EMC/Phoenix /EAC/ Cast Alloys (smelter)Contaminated nickel supplied by EMC into the US. Amount of loss being established now. Incident much less bad than initial reports suggested, and have therefore deferred explosion survey/investigation lined up on urgent basis earlier this week. Expect indemnity claim to be brought against EMC by Phoenixx in LME arbitration; and to pass same claim on to the LCH. Assume possibility of US tort claim also lying direct from Smelter to EMC (awaiting advice from Limor Nissan/Andy Edison on this). Facts should become sufficiently clear to enable rough quantification within next week (w/c 26/3).NB. Other similarly contaminated shipments from the same warehouse are known to exist. Warnings to other customers are being prepared.5. LME arbitration: Chinese receiver/ICD/Brandeis/EMC/EML/LCH/WarehouseClaim brought by Chinese receivers for supply of defective nickel on LME warrant bought through London clearing. Only US$62,000 claim, but involves significant point of principle, hence decision taken to proceed in arbitration. Should in principle be able to pass on incoming claim to LCH (and beyond). Expect unrecoverable costs (internal and external) to exceed the amount of the claim. Solicitors to be instructed w/c 26/3.\n"

While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for a few days.   I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.   Also, I'll have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper.   (See   attached).   At this point, however, I'm not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis.   You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.   As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.Preliminary Overall AssessmentThe PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.   While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basis---which generally supports MPLP's position---the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 1\" only would apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 35\" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract Term.   The anomaly \"running in the other direction\" is that, under CMS's interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis (e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would be applied \"mid-stream\" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged \"contract year\" ).   My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly (described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year concept (i.e., the 21 month \"Year 35\" issue) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around...More Information/Diligence/ResearchBefore a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you forwarded):---The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) in a published Order.   Was there anything in that Order or the submissions (or exhibits thereto, including financial projections) that might provide some guidance?---My guess is that there must be other CMS QF PPAs with the same type of pricing structure since this issue essentially would arise in every instance where the COD was not a Jan.1.   Do we (or local counsel) know whether this may be a \"global\" attack by CMS on these types of PPAs?---While not directly relevant to the contract interpretation question, confirm with local counsel that CMS would have recovered the \"excess\" capacity payments from its customers---so that it presumably would have to issue a customer refund if it were to prevail on its claims.---CMS \"self bills\" itself under the PPA.   Has the statute of limitations run on any of its claims for refunds for prior years?   Can CMS's prior course of dealing be used to support MPLP's contractual interpretation, or is there otherwise an equitable argument that CMS should not be able to recover prior \"overpayments\" (as opposed to prospectively adjusting the capacity payments)?   (This could be particularly helpful to try to settle out the dispute on the basis that MPLP would concede the issue on a prospective basis only).---The cover letter from CMS suggests that the alleged payment error resulted in payments in excess of the avoided cost rate authorized by the PUC.   Isn't this determination to be made over the life of the PPA, rather than for any particular period?   Assuming CMS's statement is correct, I assume it does not affect the validity of the PPA, but only whether CMS can recover the \"excess\" amount in rates?---Do we have any leverage in the event we were to raise this dispute with the PUC?   If so, can this be used in the context of trying to work out an overall restructuring of the PPA?Certain Points in Support of MPLP's Position---The definition of \"Contract Capacity Factor\" provides for a calendar year determination and, most importantly, provides for a partial year calculation for the year in which the COD occurs that ends at the end of that calendar year.   If the capacity charge should be adjusted as of the anniversary of the COD date, it arguably would not make sense to have a partial year calculation.---Sec. 10(a) provides that if in any calendar year the Contract Capacity Factor is less than 60%, then the capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D \"shall be adjusted for the next calendar year as follows... The capacity charges for the following calendar year shall then be determined...   (Emphasis added).   This section makes specific reference to Exhibit D and makes the adjustment effective for the next calendar year, not on the next anniversary of the COD.   It arguably would not appear to make any sense to apply the Contract Capacity Factor adjustment on a calendar basis, but determine the capacity charges on a COD anniversary basis if no adjustments thereto are required because the Contract Capacity Factor levels do not require an adjustment. ---NOTE:   The counter-argument, however, is that the foregoing language only pertains to the computation of a percentage \"haircut\" or adjustment that is applied to the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D, whatever those may be, rather than to when the annual stated capacity charges are effective.   That is, making this adjustment on a calendar year basis, even though the scheduled capacity rates change each October 1, is not necessarily in conflict with the rest of the PPA.---Sec. 2(b) (Effective Date and Term) provides that the Agreement runs for 35 years \"and thereafter from year to year,\" unless a party gives at least one year's notice to terminate which termination shall be effective \"at the end of the 35 years or any calendar year thereafter.\" (Emphasis added).   Thus, for example, if one month after the end of the 35 year term---i.e., October 31, 2030---a party gave notice to terminate, such termination would be effective December 31, 2031, not September 30, 2031 or September 30, 2032 (i.e., not on the anniversary dates of the COD).   Thus, the PPA contemplates in certain respects certain \"stub\" years and certain \"long\" years, a contractual scheme that is at least analogous to MPLP's position on the stub and long years for the timing of the scheduled changes in the stated capacity charges on Exhibit D.---There are other calendar year based obligations---for e.g., Sec. 13 (and Exhibit B) reflect termination payments that, again, are calculated on a calendar year basis.   (We should discuss with the commercial people the economic rationale underlying the termination payments to see if there may be additional support in that respect).   (Note that some other calendar year based calculations were eliminated by the First Amendment to the PPA, but can still be used to reflect the underlying \"calendar year\" flavor of the PPA since the issue at hand existed even prior to the First Amendment).A Few Additional Points to Note---The PPA is devoid of default language, LDs, etc.; however, MPLP could bring a claim against CMS to arbitration (Sec. 18) for what it believes it is owed when CMS does not pay the full capacity charges in 20001 (plus interest as provided at Sec. 20) and keep performing under the PPA.---Although I do not see a significant issue here, let's briefly discuss the potential for CMS to try to affirmatively use an \"indication\" of a regulatory disallowance pursuant to Sec. 10&amp;copy; as a way to attempt to force its \"contract year\" interpretation of Exhibit D.   While Sec. 10&amp;copy; is one of those \"old school\" one way regulatory outs, MPLP would undoubtedly use Sec. 10(e) [requiring CMS to defend the PPA) to prevent CMS's affirmatively use of the PUC to support its contract claim.   (In Pennsylvania, PECO, in an analogous circumstance, attempted to use a PUC determination as justification to attempt to break a PPA with a QF).Let me know when you wish to follow up.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

While I think we should walk through the various contractual provisions over the phone, I nonetheless thought it might be of some help to set forth a few preliminary focal points for those discussions, particularly if you don't get to this for a few days.   I thought it made sense to contemporaneously record some comments as I was thinking through some of the issues/positions.   Also, I'll have to run down the conflict issue when I get back into the office, but I thought I could generally review the PPA in any event.In addition, I did not know whether it was ENA's or Dynegy's obligation to work on a response to CMS, but I thought it made some sense to see what one might look like on paper.   (See   attached).   At this point, however, I'm not sure whether MPLP should furnish any specific contract-based rationale in writing to CMS as to MPLP's position that the capacity charges should be adjusted on a calendar year basis.   You will note that the draft letter focuses on the language dealing with the adjustment formula to the Contract Capacity Factor (which clearly is done on a calendar year basis), rather than the scheduled changes to the stated capacity charges set forth on Exhibit D.   As noted below, there are some issues underlying this position.Preliminary Overall AssessmentThe PPA essentially is inconsistent on the capacity charge adjustment issue.   While many of the relevant computations are done on a calendar year basis---which generally supports MPLP's position---the effect of adjusting the stated capacity charges on a calendar year basis results in two anomalies: namely, the stated capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 1\" only would apply for 3 months, but even more importantly, the capacity charge (on Exhibit D) for \"Year 35\" would apply for the last 21 months of the Contract Term.   The anomaly \"running in the other direction\" is that, under CMS's interpretation, various computations would be made on a calendar year basis (e.g., Contract Capacity Factor), and adjustments resulting therefrom would be applied \"mid-stream\" (i.e., after 3 months of the alleged \"contract year\" ).   My overall concern is that an arbitrator may focus on the anomaly (described above) that results by applying Exhibit D using a calendar year concept (i.e., the 21 month \"Year 35\" issue) since that is a fairly easy concept to get your arms around...More Information/Diligence/ResearchBefore a definitive conclusion on the issue can be made, we likely would want to review or undertake, as the case may be, some additional information/diligence/research, such as (which I assume we could generally obtain from the Michigan regulatory counsel referenced in the e-mail you forwarded):---The Michigan PUC presumably approved the PPA (prior to the first amendment) in a published Order.

JamesOn Tues. 9/21 I met with Phil Zirngibl, the Alliance manager for Ft. James.   I informed him Enron wanted the original $10mm back.   It was our belief that   FJ did not act in good faith in \"expeditiously and fairly evaluating\" all of Enron's energy proposals.   Phil argued that Enron saw substantial revenue from the commodity (gas &amp; coal) deals that were executed.   I argued that commodity deals were never the \"intent\" of the Alliance as outlined in the \"Objectives of the Parties.\"   I told him we didn't need an Alliance agreement to do commodity deals.Phil was only prepared to argue the definition of \"substantial assets\" as it related to the asset sale.   I told him Kalamazoo was substantial to us because that was where we had a significant energy project.   It was also substantial because the mill was ranked in the top 3 in terms of natural gas consumption.   FJ let us work on the Kzoo project for 9 months before informing us the mill would be sold.   I told Phil this is not how Alliance partners treat each other. I asked Phil if he was prepared to offer any proposal to resolve the situation.   His response was FJ was happy with the Alliance and wanted to continue with it \"as is.\"   My response was that was not acceptable to Enron.I told him the list of potential mediators for the dispute was being sent to their counsel Greg Chaffee.Next Steps:I think we need to pick out a couple of strong project examples to use in our case to present to the mediator.   Rather than just show the list of potential deals Enron pitched and the lost opportunity value, I think a stronger case to get our original $10mm back is to say here are 3 examples, here is the value to both parties, and FJ still did not do the project (or they chose to do it themselves).   This should go a long way to proving \"bad faith\".   I will get with David Barr and start assembling this information along with the entire project list and the various \"reasons\" FJ chose not to do the projects.Based on this initial meeting, if the parties can't resolve the dispute within 30 days, the dispute goes to non-binding mediation.   The parties are to meet with the mediator within 21 days of the dispute being referred to the mediator.   Per the Alliance agreement, the mediation meeting should take place anytime between now and November 10.Let me know if you have questions.\n"

I will be inAustin tomorrow at Graves Dougherty, but she will fax the draft to methere, I will edit it and we will get something over for you to look attomorrow evening.As we anticipated, what prompted this was our insistence on theappointment of the third appraiser---so there is no need to reevaluateour strategy at this stage.   We will simply proceed as planned to file aresponse in opposition to a stay of the appraisal proceeding and,simultaneously, a plea in abatement/motion for stay asking the judge tostay Intrust's common law claims pending the resolution of the appraisalproceeding.I will call you to check in with you about mid-day to get your thoughts.I will also have my cell phone with me, (713) 249-26777, and you canreach me there if need be.Thanks,KPP.S. - Could I trouble you to forward this on to Gene Humphrey and MarkLay?   I'd like for them to know the drafting schedule, but I don't havetheir e-mail addresses.\n"

In the pace of the year-end I forgot to inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.   The litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny for Canadian Enerdata.It is somewhat complicated.   In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.   Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.   Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.   The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.   We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.]In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.   All are viable claims but difficult to prove.   We have to get past simply being outsmarted.   We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.   The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$1000MM.   We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.   Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market.In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels &amp; Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.   We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon.My apologies for not letting you know sooner.   I had discussed the matter with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and Richard a line, but I simply forgot.   If you have any questions or concerns, please call at 403.974.6923.   If I don't hear from you, all the best for the holidays.Peter.\n"

      "body": "\nKnox---thanks for taking the time to consider Felix Todaro's case. I met Felix 10 years or so ago when he was referred to me through the Houston Volunteer Lawyers Program. Felix wanted a divorce and custody of his then 6 year old daughter. His wife had a drug problem and he did not think his daughter would   be safe in her care, After a brief court case, he was awarded custody of his daughter who is now a student at Deer Park High School. Felix called me two years ago and asked if I could help him w/ his divorce from his second wife. Felix tried to go through the HVLP but was over their income threshold. I asked David Schwab(Elizabeth Dodge' husband) at Bracewell to handle it as a favor to me. At the time,   Felix had a job at a laundry company making an hourly fee--- he has since left that job and now works at a garage making $5000(gross) per week. He was unemployed for the first six months of 2000 and he has no assets. Felix and his second wife had a 2 year old daughter at the time of his second divorce. Although Felix seriously considered fighting for custody, he thought his second wife was a good mother and gave up the fight. Felix was named possessory conservator under his divorce decree. Felix agreed to pay child support and he tells me he is current. Shortly after their divorce, his ex-wife asked his permission to move to Iowa, where her family lived. Felix let her go. He has not seen his daughter in two years. Last month he heard that his ex-wife was dying of brain cancer and asked if he could see his daughter in Iowa. His mother in law denied him access. Last month his ex-wife died. I wrote a letter to the mother in law   asking for the orderly transfer of the child to Felix. An attorney called me to inform me that the grandmother would resist. Obviously, I am not in a position to help Felix, but I was hoping that V&amp;E would take on his case. Please let me know asap whether you can help.\n"

        " Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 02/27/20001 08:58 AM ---\tRon Tapscott\t02/27/20001 08:06 AM \t\t\t To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Richard,I have attached an e-mail forwarded to Claude Chandler (FM Global) in response to an earlier e-mail from him and another e-mail received last Friday stating their new position.   I will also send to you the e-mails from Claude I mentioned in the preceeding sentence.   I will follow this with a phone call to you this morning so I can bring you up to speed on the activity associated with this insurance claim.   One item that needs your immediate attention is a provision in the Insurance Policy that could hamper our ability to litigate if this becomes our only viable alternative to resolve the differences.   There is a deadline for litigation tied to the date of the initial failure (one year which would make it June 15, 20001).   It also requires that prior to litigation, the parties need to first resolve through dispute resolution/arbitration.   It has been my experience that arbitration normally takes 90-120 days.   There is only one defined action with days attached to it in the policy (60 days to establish reps for each party).   I think you see the dilemna.I look forward to our discussion.Thanks, Ron.   ---",
        " Ron Tapscott/HOU/ECT on 02/27/20001 07:52 AM ---Ron Tapscott02/26/20001 04:59 PMTo: claude.chandler@fmglobal.comcc: James L Bouillion/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Marshall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert P Virgo/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Claude,In regard to your e-mail dated February 7th, we will be sending to you (tomorrow for overnight delivery) documentation in support of our claim and responses to address other open issues as stated in your e-mail.   The information will address the following:Previous detail and summaries of the original insurance claim amount of $6,452,318.02New detail and summaries for Enron's current position, including ---detailed labor breakdowns for services provided by Elliott and NEPCO.   This will identify labor hours and charges by: day, craft, individual, rate classification if applicable (i.e., straight time, over time and double time), etc.Support for overhead charges applicable to NEPCO's billingSupport for other charges associated with Unit I claim not previously identified (i.e., insurance for the repair period for Unit I)Detail and summaries of other NEPCO services provided but not associated with Unit I repair/claimLetters or documentation in support of major scope differencesNote: The detail related to the NEPCO charges will follow (by end of this week). In addition, I spoke with Grady James, the Doyle Facility Plant Manager, and he indicated that the \"System 7000\" documentation prepared by NEPCO was made available to you at the site.   This documentation was provided along with the Unit 1-3 refurbishment documentation.   Fortunately, this information continues to be maintained at the site and is available for your review (at the site) if you wish.   In regard to other documentation or notes, the information forwarded by Russ Porter in early February should have satisfied all previous requests.   If there is a specific request beyond what we have already forwarded, we will respond accordingly.You also indicated in your e-mail a desire to directly contact sub-contractors to discuss their scope of work.   As a result of confidentiality provisions within the service agreements, I would request that you indicate to me who you would like to contact and we will provide the necessary waivers to those parties.   Last, we just received your e-mail (dated Friday, Feb. 23) related to FM Global's current position.   Obviously we are disappointed that the two parties are this far apart.   Can I assume that this position reflects everything you characterized as outstanding in your e-mail (i.e., awaiting signoff from Charlie McCorckle and others)?   I assume we will have questions as we continue to review the material.   Should we forward those to you?   Please call me if you have any questions or comments on 713-853-9298.   Thanks, Ron.   \n"

Judge Berle sustained the Demurrers, providingPlaintiffs with twenty days to file an amended complaint.   Steve and Ibelieve that this twenty-day period provides us with a critical opportunityto try and persuade Plaintiffs to drop ECT from the lawsuit.   In order to doso, however, we need to accelerate our fact gathering so that we canarticulate with precision ECT's role, or lack thereof, in the purchase andsale of the NSM Notes.   While the Offering Memorandum (p. 179) statesgenerally what Notes were purportedly purchased by ECT and other \"initialpurchasers,\" we must understand (i) what Notes were sold, (ii) to whom and(ii) by whom.   This requires a discussion with Travis McCullough and, quitepossibly, Kevin McConville.Steve and I would like to have a call with you early next week regarding theforegoing.Thanks,Roland Tellis(213) 892-4573This e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidentialinformation.

Nothingfancy or time consuming, just a brief updateFor example:Today:   (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have todisclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 19998, even aboutMarch 19998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice ofcounsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred rulingwhether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 19998concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.   (I want to find outwhat this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)   (2)   Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort byNatwest to postpone the trial in California until September.   I don't thinkNatwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.   I am notplanning for   ECT Securities to take a position.   (3)   We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath's report, afterremoving a big section discussing Hellmold's report in light of Tom Hatch'sstatement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECTSecurities.Later this week:   Hellmold's deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY. I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say, or notsay, about ECT Securities.Do you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about Ponti Singh's depo (andalso her remark on the street to Brian that McDonald is going to blame Enronfor something concerning related party transactions?Steve HowardAlschuler Grossman Stein &amp; Kahan LLPphone: 310-407-7613fax: 310-5552-60777cell:   213-716-0536e-mail:   showard@agsk.com   ...ALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN &amp; KAHAN LLPATTORNEYS AT LAWww.agsk.com2049 Century Park EastThirty-Ninth FloorLos Angeles, CA 900067-3213Tel 310-2777-12226Fax 310-5552-60777This transmission is intended only for the useof the addressee and may contain informationthat is privileged, confidential and exempt fromdisclosure under applicable law.

The deponent is Arthur Cobb, a disclosure/due diligence expert retained byRobins, Kaplan in several cases in which Enron is not named.   Mr. Cobb'sreport did not mention ECT Securities, and the California plaintiffs did notdesignate him to testify in the CA cases, so we decided not to attend hisdeposition.   We are getting daily transcripts by e-mail.   Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation anddamage issues is being deposed in San Francisco.   Roland has a schedulingconflict, so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt.   The subject on which we want toask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after theinitial offering.   This is a very discrete area, easy to understand, andJonathan is on top of it.   I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath.   Gerryworked very hard on his report, putting in about 50% more hours than hethought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report.   He isvery focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in 30days.   I think Gerry did quite a good job, and we definitely need his besteffort going forward.   I would urge Enron to pay Gerry's bill very promptly.   Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers tointerrogatories from us.   It is much ado about nothing.   We just want to dealwith it in the least expensive way.   Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country, includingin CA, seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employeeconversations.   My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff,and Natwest is trying to limit their losses.   We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing. It is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law. The problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision (prorata, not relative fault) in the state securities statutes and a common lawdoctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault. The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action againstECT Securities, but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligentmisrepresentation causes of action.   How all of this works together isvirtually uncharted.   With reference to your question about procedures at trial, none of thedefendants has cross-complained against the other defendants for adetermination of relative fault in the pending case; and, on the basis of thecurrent pleadings, no such determination will be made at trial.   If Enron goesto trial and loses, along with others, theoretically the plaintiffs couldcollect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the otherdefendants, post-trial, for their respective shares of the liability, whethersuch shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault.   We are working on amemorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you.   I think you willfind that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle (assuming that we canget the price low enough.)Steve HowardAlschuler Grossman Stein &amp; Kahan LLPphone: 310-407-7613fax: 310-5552-60777cell:   213-716-0536e-mail:   showard@agsk.com   ...ALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN &amp; KAHAN LLPATTORNEYS AT LAWww.agsk.com2049 Century Park EastThirty-Ninth FloorLos Angeles, CA 900067-3213Tel 310-2777-12226Fax 310-5552-60777This transmission is intended only for the useof the addressee and may contain informationthat is privileged, confidential and exempt fromdisclosure under applicable law.

        " Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 111/222/999 06:31 AM ---Dawne Davis &lt;DDAVIS@HOLLANDHART.COM&lt; on 111/20/999 04:05:29 PMTo: cc: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: News Flash!   Supreme Court to review qui tam standing this termWe received this news flash courtesy of John Boese. CIVIL FALSE CLAIMS ACT:   SUPREME COURT ORDERS BRIEFING ON CONSTITUTIONALITY OF QUI TAM ENFORCEMENT In a surprise announcement, the Supreme Court yesterday indicated that it will determine this term whether a private individual (known as a\"relator\") who files a qui tam False Claims Act cases has standing to bring such a case. In an FCA case already fully briefed and ready for argument on November 29,   Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. United States ex rel Stevens, No. 98-1828, the court had granted certiorari to determine two issues:   (1)   whether states have immunity under the Eleventh Amendment from FCA suits brought by qui tam relators, and   (2) whether states are \"persons\" subject to FCA liability.   Yesterday,   the Supreme Court issued an orderinstructing the parties to file, by November 30, additional briefs on the qui tam relator's standing to bring an FCA suit.   A panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently issued an opinion declaring qui tam enforcement unconstitutional, a ruling that would have created a conflict among the circuits.   See, United States ex rel. Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, No. 97-20948, 1999 WL 1034216   (5th Cir. Nov 15, 1999), discussed in FraudMail Alertc 111-15-999 and FraudMail Alert No. 999-111-18.   In a split decision, the Fifth Circuit panel ruled   that when the government declines intervention, qui tam enforcement of the FCA violates the Take Care Clause of the Constitution and the separation of powers doctrine.   However, that ruling was vacated and the Riley case is now before the full Fifth Circuit for en banc review. The constitutionality of qui tam enforcement has been hotly debated since the watershed amendments to the False Claims Act in 1986 significantly expanded the rights and powers of qui tam relators.   Every district court toconsider the issue, and five (5) courts of appeals, had concluded that qui tam enforcement is constitutional, albeit on conflicting (and sometimes inexplicable) grounds.   Judge Hoyt's ruling in Riley was the first district court opinion holding that   qui tam enforcement is unconstitutional.   TheDistrict Court in Riley concluded that the qui tam relator lacked standing to sue under the FCA because he had suffered no injury in fact.   See Riley v. St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, 982 F. Supp. 1261 (S.D. Tex 19997).   TheFifth Circuit panel affirmed this ruling, but on different constitutional grounds.   It was hoped that on rehearing en banc the Fifth Circuit would also find the qui tam provisions unconstitutional, and would create a conflict in the circuits to require Supreme Court review of this constitutional issue. The Supreme Court's order yesterday in the Stevenscase indicates that the Court intends to expedite that consideration and resolve at least the standing issue this term. One final note:   while it is surprising that the constitutional issue would be raised by the Court at such a late date, the issue is not new to the Stevens case.   In the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Stevens, 162 F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 1999), Judge Jack B. Weinstein, sitting bydesignation, issued a lengthy dissent from the panel decision both on the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity and on the separation of powers and standing issues even though the Second Circuit had ruled in 19993 that qui tam enforcement was constitutional.   See, U.S. ex rel. Kreindler &amp; Kreindler v. United Technologies Corp., 985 F. 2d 11148 (2d Cir.), cert denied, 1113 S. Ct. 2962 (19993).   And, of course, it is not unusual for the court to question standing at any time.FraudMail Alertc No. 111-20-999\n"

These change=\rs=20\rare intended to accomplish four key objectives:\r First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=\rl=20\rbusiness model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\r=20\rThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\raround a relatively small strategic asset position.\r Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\rrelationships.   Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=\r=20\rdirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=\r=20\rhas become increasingly difficult.\r Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\rg=20\rthe ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20\rhindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\rg=20\rasset positions.\r And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=\r=20\rredeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.\r ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\r Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=\r=20\rour global wholesale businesses.   The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\rbusinesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20\rcoordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\r=20\rhigher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20\ropportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=\rf=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=\rd=20\rmarkets.\r Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=\r=20\r(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\roperations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=\rnit=20\ras well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.   In addition, Enron=01,s me=\rrchant=20\rbusinesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=\r=20\rnew structure as described below.\r Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=\re=20\rthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.   Greg Whalley,=20\rcurrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=\r=20\rof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.\r Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\r=20\rinternational business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\rp=20\rpositions:\r Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=\r=20\rand CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=\ry=20\rfor managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=\rorth=20\rAmerica and Europe.   Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=\r=20\rwill be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.   Rebecca and Jim will=20\rreport to the EWS Office of the Chairman.\r Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\rhe=20\rMiddle East and Asia region.   Sanjay will be responsible for building our=\r=20\rbroadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=\r=20\rwill report to Sanjay.   In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =\rof=20\rthe Chairman.   In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=\r=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=\rness=20\rinto Enron Global Assets in the near future.\r=20\rDiomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\r=20\rEBS as Chief Commercial Officer.   Diomedes will be located in London and wi=\rll=20\rfocus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20\rattention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.   Diomedes will report to=\r=20\rthe EBS Office of the Chairman.\r Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=\rS=20\rto lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.   In or=\rder=20\rto ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20\rfacilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=\r=20\rat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\rh=20\rAmerica.   Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=\r=20\rthe Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.   Following the=20\rtransition, Jim will join EES.\r In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20\ractivities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=\r=20\rbusinesses and the commercial support functions:\r Enron Net Works\rLouise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\r and=20\rCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\r Enron Americas\rConcurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=\r=20\roperating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20\rmarketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=\rt=20\rinto a new entity, Enron Americas.   Enron Americas will have responsibility=\r=20\rfor all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20\rAmerica.   Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\rOperating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20\rAmericas.\r Enron Europe\rThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=\rralia=20\rand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\r=20\rSherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.\r Enron Global Markets\rEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=\r=20\rCEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20\rresponsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.   With the=20\rexception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20\rassociated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=\r=20\rEnron Global Assets.   Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=\r=20\rcommodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20\requities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.\r Enron Industrial Markets\rEnron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=\rahon,=20\rPresident &amp; CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.\r Commercial Support for EWS\rThe commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=\ry,=20\rthe individual business units.   We are creating no incremental overhead in=\r=20\rthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\r=20\refficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.\r To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=\r=20\rEWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.   These=\r=20\rnewly defined roles are as follows:\r Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=\re=20\rOperations across EWS.   These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=\r=20\rwith Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20\rPresident and Chief Accounting Officer.   This alignment creates a coordinat=\red=20\rservices organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20\rwholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=\r=20\rservices.   Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=\r=20\rcontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=\r=20\rfor specific commodities and/or geographic locations.\rLegal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\rRegulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =\ron a=20\rregional basis.   Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=\r=20\rthe Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=\r=20\rEuropean and Eastern Hemisphere operations.

The primary role of this committee will continue to=\r=20\rbe the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=\rnd=20\rthe coordination of activities across those businesses.   We will also be=20\rdrawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20\rperformance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =\r=20\rThe Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.\r   We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=\rtee. =20\rThis group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20\rmanagement policy and corporate strategy.   The Enron Corporate Policy=20\rCommittee membership is also shown on the attached list.\r   We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =\rto=20\rour highest return opportunities.

If we don't make November (I knowyou're swamped!), December would be OK, but it is very important to us thatwe get caught up by year end.

Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones.   Apparently, word is on the street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the \"misconduct\" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.   Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the \"unnamed\" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.   Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be:   \"The same people who colluded in the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it.\"   No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.   Two immediate thoughts:Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed \"Czar\" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890).   Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.   He also set up the Governing Boards.\n"

Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of departmental information sharing activities.   Since we are faced on a daily basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation preferences.   It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   Sorry for the inconvenient location.   We'll make it worth your while with the quality of the food and the presentation.\n"

HarveyMorris of the CPUC to negotiate an extension of time for responding to thefive subpoenas issued to Enron affiliates and Portland General.   Wenegotiated both an extension for initial responses (two weeks) plus anopportunity to submit a proposal for a significant reduction in the scope ofthe request for production of documents.   This will include a furtherextension for other documents that are to be produced, as well as areservation of rights to object to the production of other documents.   Weare working in close contact with Richard Sanders and the EPMI legal team inPortland on further refining both responses and potential objections.However, in light of recent communications between the Governor's office andsenior Enron officials, and the prospect of additional such communications,Both Gary and I wanted to report an unusual aspect of the negotiation withthe CPUC.   At the beginning of the meeting, as we were indicating theoverall burden of the request, the CPUC attorney indicated the extremepressure the Commission was under to \"get to the bottom\" of what washappening in the California power markets.   He also recited that \"manyparties have pledged their cooperation in this investigation to theGovernor\".   He then proceeded to state that parties who delayed providingresponses and raised objections to the requests for production instead ofcooperating would \"be placed on a list of non-cooperative parties\" whichwould be made available to the Governor and legislators and that suchparties would have to bear the consequences of such actions.This rather explicit threat is, in my experience, unprecedented at the CPUC.I also know the attorney in question well enough to know that he would neverinvoke political reprisals on his own, and was obviously instructed to do soby CPUC Pres. Lynch or her senior staff.   Both Gary Fergus and I respondedthat such a threat was both improper and disturbing for a party simplytrying to exercise its legitimate rights to adjudicate burdensome discoveryrequests, but there was no attempt to withdraw the threat.   This commentspeaks volumes about the pressure which the CPUC President feels to achievea politically acceptable result in this matter.   Those senior Enronofficials in communication with the Governor should be made aware of thisincident.Mike Day\n"

Iwill be preparing a memorandum of my conversation with Chris which Iwill ask him to review for distribution.   In summary, Chris was frankand open, and in my view, expressed genuine corporate concern with theinvestigation.   I believe that my notes will indicate that Chris did nothave direct contact with PowerX in connection with any particular tradeduring the period being investigated by the government.   Although, in myview, Chris had general knowledge of Enron*s approach taken inconnection with bidding power into the pool, he did not see himself asspearheading or orchestrating that process.   I hope to prepare my memotoday for review by Chris later in the day.PowerX has retained the law firm of Lawson Lundell in Vancouver torepresent their interest.   The lawyer is Chris Sanderson who is a seniormember of the B.C. and Alberta Bars.   His practice focuses on regulatorylaw and civil litigation, particularly in the energy industry.I spoke to Chris Sanderson today to introduce myself and to give him avery general background on the investigation conducted at the Calgaryoffice.   He reported that a similar investigation had taken place in thePowerX office in Vancouver.   Their investigation started at the sametime as ours and ended on Thursday of last week.Chris Sanderson did confirm that there are tapes of conversations withEnron involving these various trades.   As a result, I suspect that thesetapes ought to contain the same dialogue that is contained on our tapes. I did not get into any discussion as to the information that may becontained on the tapes and exactly what information had been seized bythe government.   I did get the impression, however, that the governmenthas taken possession of tapes from PowerX.He indicated that in his preliminary view the documents themselves arenot the concern but the tapes are.   Again, I did not discuss anyparticular matter with respect to the tapes only that Enron did keeptaped conversations of trades undertaken by its traders.I think it would be worthwhile, and he agreed, if Glenn Leslie and I,and perhaps Web, met with Chris at the appropriate time.   He is open toentertain a dialogue between counsel subject of course to matters ofprivilege and commonality of interest.He indicated that he wants to take approximately two weeks to review theevidence obtained by the investigators (he has not done so yet andpreferred having a firm knowledge of the information seized by thegovernment before talking to us) and thereafter, initiate a dialoguewith us to see what information might be worth sharing.I will have Glenn Leslie give him a call to try to set a date when wemight meet with him.   We might want to discuss briefly during ourtelephone conference on Friday our approach to meeting with LawsonLundell and what would be our ultimate objectives in doing so.Yesterday, I talked to Cliff O*Brien, the counsel retained for JohnLavorato, and tried to give him a very brief overview of the issues.Unfortunately, I was at the Portland airport when I did talk to him andhad to keep my conversation somewhat cryptic.   Cliff did meet with JohnLavorato for approximately two hours last night.   Cliff called me thismorning and would like to meet with me.   I will meet him at 4:000 today.Cliff indicated that the matter was more complex than he had imaginedand expressed a view that in John*s opinion these were simple trades andnothing else.   I will report to you further on this after I have had achance to meet with Cliff O*Brien.If any of you have any questions, please don*t hesitate to call.   In anyevent, we will be talking at our regularly scheduled conference callFriday at 10:30 (central time).Regards,Dan\n"

The attached FERC complaint opposing PX action is probably not in final form yet, but I wanted to get you in the loop because it may be filed with FERC as soon as tomorrow.   The complaint explains that the PX tariff contains no prohibition against overscheduling and the California Independent System Operator, not the PX, schedules congestion over interties.   Further, under FERC precedent, without prior FERC review, the Cal PX should not be issuing letters finding violations.   Finally, the PX's analysis is seriously flawed because it doesn't consider market rules that actually caused the congestion and any potentially related price increase.   We are very concerned about the PX's actions because we believe California utilities may be awaiting this letter to sue EPMI   (estimated claims ranging between $6 million and $47 million).   We probably want to aggressively publicise the filing so our side of the story comes out instead of the PX's.   We have a meeting scheduled tomorrow with the PX where they will likely tell us if they will be issuing the letter.   Call me if you have any questions: (503) 464-88862.---",

I wanted to get you (and Richard Sanders) thinking about a request we have received from Owen Orndorff (who, for Richard's benefit, is one of the principals in Rosebud Energy Corp., the general partner of Colstrip Energy Limited Partnership (\"CELP\"), in which Enron, now through the \"Condor\" vehicle, holds a 25% limited partner interest;   CELP owns a waste coal-burning QF in Montana).Rosebud has expressed an interest in filing suit against Montana Power Company (\"MPC\"), the facility's offtake purchaser, for MPC's refusal to allow CELP to remarket power above the minimum contract demand under the facility's PPA.   I will fax to you and to Richard a memorandum that the Doney, Crowley firm, which traditionally has done some work for CELP, has prepared regarding litigation theories and chances of success.   Owen has preliminarily scheduled a partnership meeting to discuss this issue (among others, as yet identified) on April 25th in Chicago.My preliminary reactions to the Doney memo are that, at the time it was written, at least, there were a number of issues that had not been fully enough   researched for the partners to be making a decision.   I will ask Terry Donovan if further work has been done by now.   My initial reactions are that (1) having the PPA be the subject of a pending lawsuit could make our current efforts to sell our interest much more difficult;   (2) the potential is there for MPC to cook up some kind of counterclaim, which, even if not successful, puts additional pressure on the PPA, could draw out the litigation, and add costs, not to mention problems for our sale, and (3) the effort could result in as yet unknown costs to the partners (since, as I recall uner the partnership agreement, the costs would be borne by the partners - ???).   I also need to check and see just who within Enron is supposed to call the shots on the strategy for this, given that the investment is now held in Condor.I will be out of the country on vacation beginning late Friday, April 6th, until Monday, April 23.   I'd like to touch base with you before I leave, since there won't be much time to develop our response to Owen prior to the meeting on the 25th.   At that time, we can also talk about what might come up on the sale effort while I'm out (at this point, there shouldn't be much, as Terry seems immersed on another deal).I'll be in SF all this week trying to close on Pastoria, but am reachable at the office there (415/782-78000) or by pager (8000/316-0430).   Thanks.\n"

My thoughts are the following:1.   I always insist that there is a breakdown of accounts by lawyer name, hourly rate and task description.   If it is not in this account I do not know why and I think it is appropriate that you ask for it and receive it.2.   I would have expected the account to be large and that there are a number of people involved.   I lost involvement (at the direction of Delainey and Milnthorp) early in this project after the initial crisis management stage, but my observations of the number of people and resources involved are the following:   At the outset we needed a number of people to manage the search and related technical and legal issues in the short term.   Over the longer term, staffing requirements ought to be greatly reduced and it seems that since the original crisis management stage the file has been over staffed.   At the same time, in fairness, I believe Blakes feels that the are responding to the requirements of Enron to throw al ot of resources at the project.   If it has not already happened, I believe you should speak to Dan Fournier to confirm our expectations and to discuss rationalizing resources.   As I say, I was asked to step back from this project, but I am happy to have this discussion with Dan Fournier if you prefer.Also, I did not receive a copy of the account, but it seems to me that at our direction Blakes hired a number of economic and political consultants which will also be greatly expensive and which will as I understand be billed to Blakes and included in Blakes accounts as disbursements to maintain privilege.   If it has not already happened, I also believe the use of the consultants also needs to be rationalized.I also expect that VE will have a not insignificant account.In summary, since the initial stage I have had limited involvement, but I am not surprised (and would have expected) that the account is large and I expect that larger accounts are coming once consultant accounts start to roll in.   I believe that detailed account breakdowns are appropriate but also that the use of all consultants including Blakes needs to be rationalized.   I also believe that Blakes has done an excellent job and that a lot was be asked of them in the early stages and therefore they were throwing a lot of resources to the project.Lastly, in anticipation that this would be expensive and that there would be a number of people involved, Rob Milnthorp initially spoke to John Lavorato about setting up a separate Houston RC for the project which John agreed to.   The RC number I gave you may have been a Canadian RC and I need to confirm with accounting.   In any event, I will be sending a subsequent e-mail to all internal groups to make sure that all expenses, internal and external, are billed to that separate RC.Peter.Please let me know if I can be of any help.\n"

I would like to propose that we have the LeBoeuf lawyers in the office midday Tuesday to meet with us Tuesday afternoon and then as much as Wednesday as necessary. I would assume we would want a core group of lawyers to attend all or substantially all of the meetings and then we would bring in business people as appropriate. I would also try to arrange the schedule to handle EES only or EWG only issues   in blocks.1.   PLEASE LET ME KNOW   ASAP IF THIS SCHEDULE IS A PROBLEM. I know getting on everyone's calendar on short notice is a challenge.   Thanks in advance for your attention to this matter. 2.   John, can you highlight for me any areas where you expect business participation so we can start arranging our business people's schedules.3.   EWG - who will take the lead on discussing the commercial agreements?4.   Let me know if you have additional agenda topics. 5.   Jim, should we arrange some time on your calendar with the LeBoeuf lawyers?Please get me any suggestions, etc. Monday morning and we will work toward   developing the final agenda for the meeting. ---",

It has more things in it than a simple agenda, but I thought it may make some sense to be a little more inclusive in the \"bullets\" to make sure we cover as much as possible, from the standpoint of understanding or at least being aware of all of the moving parts in CA (CPUC, FERC, court litigations, etc.), while we have everyone together at this kick off meeting.   I would view the primary purpose of the meeting to obtain as much factual information as possible and to provide everyone with a general sense of the types of the considerations that would be likely to come up in the bankruptcy context.I am simultaneously sending this to our bankruptcy folks so I may have some additional comments or topics in the morning.   I also will send to you at that time a brief memo prepared by our bankruptcy lawyers that goes through some of the initial bankruptcy considerations, based upon our conversations on Friday.Please call me when you wish to follow up.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

The Risk Management group already has a file on this matter, as the plaintiff had previously filed a demand.   Upon investigation, Risk Management determined that the plaintiff's alleged accident occurred at a facility that is NOT owned by San Juan Gas, and, thus, denied the claim.

The idea is to file a brief joinder stating that the Participants' Committee in the CalPX case, representing constituents which are the real parties in interest of over $1.9 billion in claims against PG&amp;E, as scheduled by PG&amp;E inits list of 20 largest creditors, supports the motion and the joinder filed by the PG&amp;E creditors' committee.   Our joinder would state that there is no statutory basis for appointing a ratepayers' committee and that it is not in the best interest of the estate.   We might also indicate that we agree with PGE and the PGE creditors' committee that there are other means for ratepayers to be heard which make more sense than giving them official committee status.   We would also appear telephonicallyat the hearing, this Friday, at 10 a.m.Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like a conference call on this issue.   Also, please let me know as soon as possible if you object to the committee taking this position.Thank you.Jeffrey A.

(collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron Energy Marketing&lt; Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation(\"Portland&lt; General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")&lt;&lt; Harvey,&lt;&lt;   I am writing in response to the various voicemail exchanges and&lt; phone calls between Michael Day, on behalf of the Enron Entities, and&lt; yourself during the past few weeks.   Here is the current status as we&lt; understand it.   Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6,&lt; 2000 and October 18, 2000 (date of your confirming email) the Enron&lt; Entities have made the following document productions in response to the&lt; subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission (the&lt; \"Commission\"):&lt;&lt; *   October 13, 2000   Bate Nos. Enron Entities 0001-00025 on behalf&lt; of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos. 1-111, 20.&lt;&lt; *   October 27, 2000 Bate Nos. P0001-00021115 on behalf of Portland&lt; General Responsive to Request Nos. 12, 14, 16 and 18.&lt;&lt; *   November 14, 2000 Bate No. Enron Entities 00026 (Diskette with&lt; EES/EEEMC retail data) Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13, 15 to 17,&lt; and 19.&lt;&lt; *   November 15, 2000 Bate No. P00021116-00021117 (Diskettes with Portland&lt; General Data, which include approximate 3555,000 wholesale transactions)&lt; Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13 to 17, and 19.&lt;&lt; We believe with these productions, we have complied with the October&lt; 6-18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES/EEEMC.   As you&lt; know, these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights&lt; to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims, defenses,&lt; objections, jurisdictional or otherwise, or other responses.&lt;&lt;   We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for&lt; EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by&lt; October 27th.   However, we were also mindful of your expressedexpectation&lt; that any data provided be useful and reliable.   The collection of datayou&lt; requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same&lt; location nor organized as you requested it.   In fact during our review of&lt; some of the data we found significant errors that called into questionthe&lt; methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.&lt; When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it&lt; would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactionsinvolved,&lt; we informed you of the problem.   We now understand that if we cannot give&lt; you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be&lt; available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to&lt; compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission&lt; (\"FERC\").   We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data&lt; immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the&lt; immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce&lt; accurate data.&lt;&lt;   Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number&lt; of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas&lt; served on the Enron entities.   First, we understand that many other&lt; parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the&lt; detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very&lt; sound legal grounds.   Second, the Commission itself has, without ahearing&lt; on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is&lt; supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes&lt; sought by other parties served.   Third, the Commission has filed its&lt; motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data&lt; from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited&lt; hearing and production schedule.   We note that the reasons stated in the&lt; motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially&lt; different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application&lt; to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued thesubpoenas.&lt; Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a&lt; tentative order as of November 1, 2000.&lt;&lt;   Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept \"most&lt; favored nation\" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests&lt; by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce informationthat&lt; was available.   However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need&lt; for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite&lt; substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate&lt; Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described&lt; intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve itsformal&lt; objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's&lt; threatened motion to compel before FERC.&lt;&lt;   We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission&lt; has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been&lt; served with subpoenas.   We understand that there is a list for those&lt; entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been&lt; delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercisingtheir&lt; rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We understand that the Commission&lt; intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entitiesthat&lt; object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We deplore&lt; these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described&lt; above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating&lt; list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.&lt;&lt;   If you have and questions or comments, please do not hesitate to&lt; contact me.&lt;&lt;   Sincerely,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Gary S.&lt; Fergus===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and maycontain confidential and privileged information.

Bothcasesare class actions.   Neither is a Qui Tam action.   The allegations aresimilar tothose in the other Lufkin gas royalty cases.The first, in Civil Action 9:999cv2555, was filed September 20, 1999.   Theplaintiff is Jack D. Stirman, a Colorado resident.   The defendants are MobilOilCorporation, Mobil Natural Gas, Inc., Mobil Exploration and ProducingSoutheast,Inc., Mobil Exploration and Producing Texas &amp; New Mexico, Inc. and MobilExploration and Producing U.S.The second, Civil Action 9:000cv140, was filed June 8, 2000.   The plaintiffsareMelanie Sawyer Levengood of Vacaville, CA and Douglas T. Babb of Juneau, WI.The defendants are Shell Oil Company, Shell Exploration &amp; ProductionCompany,Shell Offshore, Inc., Shell Western E&amp;P, Inc. and Shell Gas Trading Company.Michael A. Havard of Provost and Umphey in Beaumont is representing theplaintiffs in both cases.   Robert R. Herring, Jr. of Fleming &amp; Asso. ofHouston,signed the Stirman complaint.Both cases are posted on the Eastern District of Texas website atww.edtx.uscourts.gov.   Enter the site and look under \"Frequently RequestedCases\".   You may also call me at Ext. 31843 to request a copy.Regarding the Gene Wright v. AGIP, et al gas royalty case, Barry Hunsakertoldme that even though Enron Corp. and Enron Oil and Gas had   been dropped asdefendants in the Second Original Amended Complaint , (both entities werenamedin   Original and First Original Amended Complaints),   both are again namedasdefendants in the Third Original Amended Complaint which was filed on June13,2000.   The firm of Verner, Liipfert, who represented the plaintiffs, had aconflict with EOG, and Barry indicated they dropped Enron and EOG topreservethe case.   That conflict has now been resolved.   The June 13 complaint isnotyet on the website, so Barry is having a copy made for us.If you have any questions, please call me at Ext. 31843.\n"

I'm not sure I follow him, but I told Deenit sounds   like Natole doesn't want to settle yet.   Our document productionis due a week from this Friday, and Alan Ludwig and Linda Guinn have beengathering the documents for us to review and respond.   On Calpine: I didn'tget to draft a lawsuit before the Thanksgiving holiday, because Michelle andHaedicke wanted me to rush a draft complaint against Duke, which I did, butnow that seems to have faltered, since we have yet to hear word that we areauthorized to file it.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon theinvestigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows: I. NATURE OF THE CASE1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of Californiafor defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.   During thespring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated theCalifornia wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflatedwholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the WesternUnited States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, andmaintenance data, and transmission system flow data to \"game\" the wholesaleelectricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from theCalifornia Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking powerwith affiliates in other states which was later resold in California atinflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincidewith other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by schedulingtransmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation ofthe California Tariff by which   defendants are authorized to sell wholesaleelectricity within California.3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants havedirectly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through theCalifornia Power Exchange.   As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune:   \"The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego areexorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19cents per kilowatt hour in just three months --- nothing short ofconfiscatory rates.\" 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (\"FERC\") expressly found that electricity prices in Californiahave been maintained at \"unjust and unreasonable\" levels during the relevantperiod, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandaterefunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.   In its November222, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California PublicUtilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation bywholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity suppliedthrough the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4billion dollars during the summer of 2000.   In its November 222nd response tothe November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, knownas the \"power grid\", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from theexercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders. II. VENUE5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in theState of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawfulmanipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San DiegoCounty.II. PARTIES6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,California.   Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer ofSDG&amp;E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the ClassPeriod (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have beenartificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.   Moreover, plaintiff PamelaR. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lackof circulation.   Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff PamelaR. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe healthconsequences.   As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon mustmaintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and71 degrees during the day.   Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable toterminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust andunfair rates for electricity from SDG&amp;E as a result of defendants'misconduct.   Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/orpaid the following rates for electricity by SDG&amp;E during the Class Period:/ / /// / /// / /// / /DatesTotal Electric Charges5-26 to 6-27-000$180.926-27 to 7-27-000$2226.6777-28 to 8-28-000$3111.848-28 to 9-27-000$143.489-27 to 10-26-000$84.717.

Defendants DOES 1 through 1000, inclusive, are sued herein underfictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amendthis complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each ofthe fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for theoccurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries anddamages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.   Further, Plaintiff is informed andbelieves, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of theDefendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefitedfrom the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately causedinjury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below. IV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code ofCivil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,including the retail customers of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company (SDG&amp;E),who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchangeduring the period from May 222, 2000 through and including the date of trial(hereinafter the \"Class Period\").   All such persons and entities have paidand/or have been charged prices for electricity that were \"unjust andunreasonable\" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,manipulations, and unlawful actions.   Members of the Class are extremelynumerous and their joinder would be impracticable.   Approximately 1.2million SDG&amp;E customers are within the class.17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,including:-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharingconfidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter\"gamed\" the market;-whether defendants charged \"unjust and unreasonable\" prices for electricityduring the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price forelectricity;-whether defendants exercised \"market power\" in the California electricitymarket during the Class Period;-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should berefunded and paid to members of the Class.18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, theinterests of the class.19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class actionand consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute thisaction.20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair andefficient adjudication of this controversy.   The size of the individualdamages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of thedefendants' operations and alleged misconduct.   A class action is the onlymethod whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress andobtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipateany difficulty with the management of this action./ / /   V. COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACTA. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets21. In 19996 California deregulated its electricity industry and requiredthe State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of theirgenerating plants.   The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competitioninto the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates forelectrical power.   In fact, however, certain participants in this recentlyderegulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, takenadvantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtainedconfidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices forelectricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits atthe expense of California consumers.222. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created tofacilitate the workings of this new market.   California's investor ownedutilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), Southern California Edison (SCE),and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) (the\"Utilities\"), now purchaseelectricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,including defendants, through a market known as the California PowerExchange (PX).   The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale ofwholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real timemarkets.   Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX andprohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator (CAISO).   The CAISO is an \"independent\"non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representativesfrom among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flowof electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltagepower lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through theCAISO managed   \"power grid\".   The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply ofpower to meet that demand./ / / 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time ImbalanceMarket (the \"Real Time Market\").   When the CAISO receives bids fromsuppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must acceptany bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under thesingle price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity inthe Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, whichis the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willingto sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. Thismechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, togame the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearingprice.25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supplyand demand.   Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of thedaily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacityto the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place toobtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is usedto balance supply and demand of electricity.   Sellers in the ReplacementReserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.   Ifcalled upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement ReserveMarket also receive the Real Time Market price.   Thus, if generators knowthat capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from thespot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement ReserveMarket.   Access to real time generating information facilitates such\"gaming\" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competingsupply.27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchaseenergy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative pricecap.   The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.   Californiagenerators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets inorder to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the Californiamarkets.   They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated anduncapped prices.   As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,2000 Report (\"the PX Compliance Report\"):/ / / \"During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above theReal-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to exportenergy out of California.   Surrounding control areas can effectively parkthat energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to thestate.\"Id. at p. 444.28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increasein exports from   the California energy market, despite the very high pricesand short supplies that existed in the State.   \"Market power\" is defined by the CAISO as the ability tosignificantly influence market prices and cause them to vary fromcompetitive levels for a material period of time.   Generators and suppliers(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically oreconomically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity outof the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources inways that impede the efficiency of the market.29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively smallnumber of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the totalgenerating capacity.   The small number of suppliers facilitates the exerciseof   market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not atrue scarcity of available generating capacity.   In addition, the relativelyinelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such marketpower.B. Defendants' Improper Acts30. Prior to May 222, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western SystemsCoordinating Council (\"WSCC\"), an organization consisting of electricindustry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data asto electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmissionsystem flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual marketparticipants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricitymarket participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given accessto real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to suchdata was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.   When requested by variousgovernmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission(\"CPUC\") the WSCC refused access./ / /// / /// / / 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;Meter Data supplied by an ISO   metered entity shall be made available by theISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity andother authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shallnot be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required bylaw, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISOTariff.32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data andinformation provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated asconfidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that isexplicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 ofthis ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participantproviding the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISOTariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shallcomply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) informationthat becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other thanas a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).333. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinatorsshall be treated by the ISO as confidential:(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are notdesignated by the scheduling coordinator as available;&amp;copy; individual bids for Ancillary Services;(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes achange to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the shortterm (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the nameof that Generator.34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISOor to review any documents, data or other information of another MarketParticipant to the extent such documents, data or information is to betreated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a marketParticipant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and otherinformation that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose suchconfidential data or information relating to an individual MarketParticipant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information asprovided for in its bylaws. 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring &amp; InformationProtocol (MMIP).   The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth theworkplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets toidentify abuses of market power.   The MMIP part of the tariff applies to allISO Market Participants, including Defendants.36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departssignificantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do notrequire continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual orunexplained market outcomes.   Evidence of such behavior may be derived froma number of circumstances, including:MMIP 2.1.1.1   withholding of generation capacity under circumstances inwhich it would normally be offered in a competitive market;MMIP 2.1.1.2   unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability byGenerators;MMIP 2.1.1.3   unusual trades or transactions;MMIP 2.1.1.4   pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent withprevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appearconsistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;andMMIP 2.1.1.5   unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from orexports to other markets or exchanges.The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whetherthe continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates thepresence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort theoperation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., thestrategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicatesthe presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptablepractices.37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:\"Gaming\", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forthin the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmissionconstraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to thedetriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.\"Gaming\" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions thatmay affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such asloop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limitson energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that mayotherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to pricemanipulation to the detriment of their efficiency. 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, toshare access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact thatits publication and use violated the   ISO's operating procedures, as setforth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,and by adoption made part of the contracts by   which defendants wereauthorized to sell electricity to the PX.   Those tariffs and protocolsrequired that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the marketand not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitivebehavior.39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October19, 2000, that:\"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports fromthe state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesaleelectricity market, according to an official with the Western SystemsCoordinating Council. * * * * * * *\"At issue is real-time information the California Independent SystemOperator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the westernU.S., about power plant activity in the state.\"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access datavia an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 2000megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .\"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability onthe grid . . . .\"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data isbeing used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,director of dispatch with the WSCC. * * * * * *\"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply anddrive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particularregion and use that to gouge customers.\"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid andreal-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required tokeep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told theWSCC.\"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information   to theWSCC or other market participants.\" 40. Starting on or about May 222, 2000, Defendants used such real timedata to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exportingelectricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market priceand other market prices.   As a direct result of their improper access to anduse of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharplyupwards on May 222, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated pricesever since.   FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all nowconcluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:\"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded thatthey held back from full production of electricity in June, even as pricesskyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies toprevent blackouts.\"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clearevidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA werecreating an artificial shortage to drive up prices. * * * * * *McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that theEncina plant in Carlsbad generated 444 percent of the megawatt hours that itcould have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost ofproduction.   The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percentof what would be expected under traditional economic theory.Economists estimate it costs $45-$555 per megawatt hour to generateelectricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 permegawatt hour.A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed \"mysteriouscutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.\" * * *** *\"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence thatelectricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's marketthis summer before they would commit their power plants to production.\"\"\"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to JimDetmers, the ISO's operations chief.\" 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about theircompetitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forwardmarkets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need tobalance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from thesingle price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any givenperiod.   In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity withaffiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in theCalifornia markets.   They then sold that electricity back into theCalifornia markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity marketto purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated SpotMarket, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. TheSpot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in thedemand for energy.C. Results of Defendants' Activities43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities haveraised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the ratesthat would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to thecosts of generating that electricity.   Those prices have resulted in anapproximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&amp;E, whereretail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a passthrough of SDG&amp;E's costs for such power, which it purchases from thedefendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.444. As the Market Surveillance Committee (\"MSC\") of the CAISO concludedin its September 6, 2000 Report (\"the MSC Report\"), during the months of Mayand June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energymarket were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would havebeen generated under competitive pricing conditions.   MSC Report at p. 2.The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a\"significant amount of   market power\" in the California energy markets,beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during theClass Period.   Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale marketsduring August of 2000 was $1666.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.   While load demand conditions inCalifornia during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, theywere similar to those during August 19998 when prices were much lower.   Peakdemand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior twoyears, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demandcaused these price increases.   Indeed, some California electricity producerswere only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods. 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of thenight, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.   Further, prices inNovember 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during thesummer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitivemarketplace.47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, theyartificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained hugewindfall profits.   As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune,   analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricityindustry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.Feygin stated, \"'The industry was literally at eight times the profitabilityof last year . . ... that is a fortune.'\"48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings willtop last year's figure by about $1110 million.   Similarly, defendant Dynegyreported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, ascompared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from DefendantDynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.\"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history\", reported chairmanand chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.   Other defendants alsoobtained large windfall profits during this period.49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatthour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Marketprice of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resultingin an approximate tripling of SDG&amp;E customers' bills.50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded thatwholesale prices of electricity in California had been at \"unjust andunreasonable\" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses tothe November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices duringSummer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generatorsand traders. 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated andinflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customersof SDG&amp;E since costs were fully passed through to them.   The CPUC's November222, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power bywholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for thedelivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.   Due to theunlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. AsCongressman Brian Bilbray stated: \"Every day that goes by you've got smallbusinesses bleeding to death.   People are literally dying financially fromthis situation.\"   Work.com Newswire (10/21/000).52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricitygeneration and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation byunplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrivedand artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect ofartificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices abovecompetitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting tobillions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of theAntitrust Act (Against All Defendants)53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: \"Except as provided inthis chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.\"   Atrust is defined at o16720 as follows:555. \"A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or morepersons for any of the following purposes:(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price ofmerchandise or of any commodity.&amp;copy; To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public orconsumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article orcommodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, useor consumption in this State.(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do allor any or any combination of the following: (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article orany commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce orconsumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity ortransportation at a fixed or graduated figure.(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity ortransportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly orindirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity.(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any intereststhat they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.\"56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750to commence a private action for up to three times their damages andequitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue tosuffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.   TheCartwright Act states:Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason ofanything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are \"persons\" within the meaning of theAntitrust Act as defined in o16702.58. Beginning on or about May 222, 2000, the exact date being presentlyunknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make availableand use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, anorganization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the marketprices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce inCalifornia. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts andentered into Agreements, which   were intended to and have in fact restrainedtrade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricitymarkets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuingto the present day. 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuingagreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, thesubstantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply ofelectricity to the California markets.   Through these acts and Agreements,Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on theReal Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers ofelectricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, atsupra-competitive prices.60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitivewholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 222, 2000, to the customersof the California Power Exchange.61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such asPlaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade andcommerce in California during the Class Period.63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unlessenjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitiveeffects, among others:(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesalepurchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&amp;E in California havebeen and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially highand non-competitive levels;(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricityand retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrainedand adversely affected; and&amp;copy; Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefitof free and open competition in the electricity market in California.64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentDefendants' unlawful conduct.65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.666. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly,Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoiningDefendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / / SECOND CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act(against all defendants)67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,which is defined as \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act orpractice,\" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,   oo167000 et seq.of the B&amp;P Code.69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendantsunlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restraincompetition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 167000 et seq.and oo 172000 et seq. of the B&amp;P Code.70. Pursuant to B&amp;P Code oo 172000 et seq., Plaintiff brings this actionseeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices andrequiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of theirviolations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentdefendants' unlawful conduct.72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, allegedherein, violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Classeek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all moniesobtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to thecontract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunctionenjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / /// / / THIRD CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and PracticesIn Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates(against all defendants)74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.75. Section 172000 et seq. of the California Business &amp; Professions Codeprohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any \"unlawful, unfair,or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue ormisleading advertising\".76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of   \"unfaircompetition\", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating theprice of wholesale electricity in the California markets.777. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:\"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility foror in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject tothe jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable andany such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declaredto be unlawful.\"16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in theforegoing statute.79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants chargedfor the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during theClass Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.   The California PublicUtilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable pricesresulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in theCalifornia wholesale electricity market.80. As a result of the conduct described above, the   defendantsunlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and havebeen and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and themembers of the Class.   Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff andthe Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity atunjust, excessive, and manipulated prices./ / / 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtrestoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them aclaim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as torestore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and thegeneral public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair anddeceptive acts and practices.82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtproviding appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restrainingdefendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulatingthe electricity markets. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Against All Defendants)83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer LegalRemedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.   Defendants' acts warrantappropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunctionrestraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating themarket for electricity.FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTIONUnconscionability(Against All Defendants)85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that wereunconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent marketsfor that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.87. Defendants' rates were   inherently   excessive, invalid andunconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulativepractices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital needconsumers and businesses have for electrical power./ / / 888. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiffand the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged bySDG&amp;E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class. VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEFWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants asfollows:(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as aclass action and direct that reasonable   notice of this action be given tothe members of the Class;(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracyand trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonablerestraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of theCalifornia Business and Professions Code;&amp;copy; That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff andthe Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgmentinterest;(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitablerelief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief asthe Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.Dated: November 27,   2000   KRAUSE &amp;KALFAYAN___James C.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon theinvestigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows: I. NATURE OF THE CASE1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of Californiafor defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.   During thespring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated theCalifornia wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflatedwholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the WesternUnited States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, andmaintenance data, and transmission system flow data to \"game\" the wholesaleelectricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from theCalifornia Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking powerwith affiliates in other states which was later resold in California atinflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincidewith other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by schedulingtransmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation ofthe California Tariff by which   defendants are authorized to sell wholesaleelectricity within California.3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants havedirectly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through theCalifornia Power Exchange.   As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune:   \"The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego areexorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19cents per kilowatt hour in just three months --- nothing short ofconfiscatory rates.\" 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (\"FERC\") expressly found that electricity prices in Californiahave been maintained at \"unjust and unreasonable\" levels during the relevantperiod, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandaterefunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.   In its November222, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California PublicUtilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation bywholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity suppliedthrough the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4billion dollars during the summer of 2000.   In its November 222nd response tothe November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, knownas the \"power grid\", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from theexercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders. II. VENUE5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in theState of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawfulmanipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San DiegoCounty.II. PARTIES6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,California.   Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer ofSDG&amp;E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the ClassPeriod (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have beenartificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.   Moreover, plaintiff PamelaR. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lackof circulation.   Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff PamelaR.

Defendants DOES 1 through 1000, inclusive, are sued herein underfictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amendthis complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each ofthe fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for theoccurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries anddamages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.   Further, Plaintiff is informed andbelieves, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of theDefendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefitedfrom the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately causedinjury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below. IV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code ofCivil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,including the retail customers of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company (SDG&amp;E),who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchangeduring the period from May 222, 2000 through and including the date of trial(hereinafter the \"Class Period\").   All such persons and entities have paidand/or have been charged prices for electricity that were \"unjust andunreasonable\" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,manipulations, and unlawful actions.   Members of the Class are extremelynumerous and their joinder would be impracticable.   Approximately 1.2million SDG&amp;E customers are within the class.17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,including:-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharingconfidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter\"gamed\" the market;-whether defendants charged \"unjust and unreasonable\" prices for electricityduring the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price forelectricity;-whether defendants exercised \"market power\" in the California electricitymarket during the Class Period;-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should berefunded and paid to members of the Class.18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, theinterests of the class.19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class actionand consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute thisaction.20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair andefficient adjudication of this controversy.   The size of the individualdamages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of thedefendants' operations and alleged misconduct.   A class action is the onlymethod whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress andobtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipateany difficulty with the management of this action./ / /   V. COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACTA. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets21. In 19996 California deregulated its electricity industry and requiredthe State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of theirgenerating plants.   The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competitioninto the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates forelectrical power.   In fact, however, certain participants in this recentlyderegulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, takenadvantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtainedconfidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices forelectricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits atthe expense of California consumers.222. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created tofacilitate the workings of this new market.   California's investor ownedutilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), Southern California Edison (SCE),and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) (the\"Utilities\"), now purchaseelectricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,including defendants, through a market known as the California PowerExchange (PX).   The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale ofwholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real timemarkets.   Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX andprohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator (CAISO).   The CAISO is an \"independent\"non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representativesfrom among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flowof electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltagepower lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through theCAISO managed   \"power grid\".   The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply ofpower to meet that demand./ / / 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time ImbalanceMarket (the \"Real Time Market\").   When the CAISO receives bids fromsuppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must acceptany bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under thesingle price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity inthe Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, whichis the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willingto sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. Thismechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, togame the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearingprice.25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supplyand demand.   Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of thedaily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacityto the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place toobtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is usedto balance supply and demand of electricity.   Sellers in the ReplacementReserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.   Ifcalled upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement ReserveMarket also receive the Real Time Market price.   Thus, if generators knowthat capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from thespot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement ReserveMarket.   Access to real time generating information facilitates such\"gaming\" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competingsupply.27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchaseenergy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative pricecap.   The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.   Californiagenerators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets inorder to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the Californiamarkets.   They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated anduncapped prices.   As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,2000 Report (\"the PX Compliance Report\"):/ / / \"During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above theReal-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to exportenergy out of California.   Surrounding control areas can effectively parkthat energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to thestate.\"Id. at p. 444.28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increasein exports from   the California energy market, despite the very high pricesand short supplies that existed in the State.   \"Market power\" is defined by the CAISO as the ability tosignificantly influence market prices and cause them to vary fromcompetitive levels for a material period of time.   Generators and suppliers(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically oreconomically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity outof the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources inways that impede the efficiency of the market.29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively smallnumber of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the totalgenerating capacity.   The small number of suppliers facilitates the exerciseof   market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not atrue scarcity of available generating capacity.   In addition, the relativelyinelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such marketpower.B. Defendants' Improper Acts30. Prior to May 222, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western SystemsCoordinating Council (\"WSCC\"), an organization consisting of electricindustry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data asto electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmissionsystem flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual marketparticipants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricitymarket participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given accessto real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to suchdata was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.   When requested by variousgovernmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission(\"CPUC\") the WSCC refused access./ / /// / /// / / 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;Meter Data supplied by an ISO   metered entity shall be made available by theISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity andother authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shallnot be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required bylaw, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISOTariff.32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data andinformation provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated asconfidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that isexplicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 ofthis ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participantproviding the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISOTariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shallcomply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) informationthat becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other thanas a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).333. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinatorsshall be treated by the ISO as confidential:(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are notdesignated by the scheduling coordinator as available;&amp;copy; individual bids for Ancillary Services;(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes achange to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the shortterm (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the nameof that Generator.34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISOor to review any documents, data or other information of another MarketParticipant to the extent such documents, data or information is to betreated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a marketParticipant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and otherinformation that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose suchconfidential data or information relating to an individual MarketParticipant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information asprovided for in its bylaws. 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring &amp; InformationProtocol (MMIP).   The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth theworkplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets toidentify abuses of market power.   The MMIP part of the tariff applies to allISO Market Participants, including Defendants.36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departssignificantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do notrequire continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual orunexplained market outcomes.   Evidence of such behavior may be derived froma number of circumstances, including:MMIP 2.1.1.1   withholding of generation capacity under circumstances inwhich it would normally be offered in a competitive market;MMIP 2.1.1.2   unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability byGenerators;MMIP 2.1.1.3   unusual trades or transactions;MMIP 2.1.1.4   pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent withprevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appearconsistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;andMMIP 2.1.1.5   unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from orexports to other markets or exchanges.The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whetherthe continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates thepresence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort theoperation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., thestrategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicatesthe presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptablepractices.37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:\"Gaming\", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forthin the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmissionconstraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to thedetriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.\"Gaming\" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions thatmay affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such asloop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limitson energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that mayotherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to pricemanipulation to the detriment of their efficiency. 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, toshare access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact thatits publication and use violated the   ISO's operating procedures, as setforth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,and by adoption made part of the contracts by   which defendants wereauthorized to sell electricity to the PX.   Those tariffs and protocolsrequired that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the marketand not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitivebehavior.39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October19, 2000, that:\"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports fromthe state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesaleelectricity market, according to an official with the Western SystemsCoordinating Council. * * * * * * *\"At issue is real-time information the California Independent SystemOperator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the westernU.S., about power plant activity in the state.\"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access datavia an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 2000megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .\"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability onthe grid . . . .\"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data isbeing used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,director of dispatch with the WSCC. * * * * * *\"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply anddrive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particularregion and use that to gouge customers.\"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid andreal-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required tokeep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told theWSCC.\"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information   to theWSCC or other market participants.\" 40. Starting on or about May 222, 2000, Defendants used such real timedata to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exportingelectricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market priceand other market prices.   As a direct result of their improper access to anduse of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharplyupwards on May 222, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated pricesever since.   FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all nowconcluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:\"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded thatthey held back from full production of electricity in June, even as pricesskyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies toprevent blackouts.\"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clearevidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA werecreating an artificial shortage to drive up prices. * * * * * *McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that theEncina plant in Carlsbad generated 444 percent of the megawatt hours that itcould have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost ofproduction.   The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percentof what would be expected under traditional economic theory.Economists estimate it costs $45-$555 per megawatt hour to generateelectricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 permegawatt hour.A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed \"mysteriouscutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.\" * * *** *\"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence thatelectricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's marketthis summer before they would commit their power plants to production.\"\"\"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to JimDetmers, the ISO's operations chief.\" 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about theircompetitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forwardmarkets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need tobalance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from thesingle price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any givenperiod.   In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity withaffiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in theCalifornia markets.   They then sold that electricity back into theCalifornia markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity marketto purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated SpotMarket, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. TheSpot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in thedemand for energy.C. Results of Defendants' Activities43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities haveraised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the ratesthat would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to thecosts of generating that electricity.   Those prices have resulted in anapproximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&amp;E, whereretail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a passthrough of SDG&amp;E's costs for such power, which it purchases from thedefendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.444. As the Market Surveillance Committee (\"MSC\") of the CAISO concludedin its September 6, 2000 Report (\"the MSC Report\"), during the months of Mayand June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energymarket were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would havebeen generated under competitive pricing conditions.   MSC Report at p. 2.The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a\"significant amount of   market power\" in the California energy markets,beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during theClass Period.   Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale marketsduring August of 2000 was $1666.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.   While load demand conditions inCalifornia during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, theywere similar to those during August 19998 when prices were much lower.   Peakdemand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior twoyears, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demandcaused these price increases.   Indeed, some California electricity producerswere only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods. 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of thenight, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.   Further, prices inNovember 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during thesummer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitivemarketplace.47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, theyartificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained hugewindfall profits.   As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune,   analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricityindustry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.Feygin stated, \"'The industry was literally at eight times the profitabilityof last year . . ... that is a fortune.'\"48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings willtop last year's figure by about $1110 million.   Similarly, defendant Dynegyreported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, ascompared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from DefendantDynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.\"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history\", reported chairmanand chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.   Other defendants alsoobtained large windfall profits during this period.49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatthour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Marketprice of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resultingin an approximate tripling of SDG&amp;E customers' bills.50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded thatwholesale prices of electricity in California had been at \"unjust andunreasonable\" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses tothe November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices duringSummer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generatorsand traders. 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated andinflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customersof SDG&amp;E since costs were fully passed through to them.   The CPUC's November222, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power bywholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for thedelivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.   Due to theunlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. AsCongressman Brian Bilbray stated: \"Every day that goes by you've got smallbusinesses bleeding to death.   People are literally dying financially fromthis situation.\"   Work.com Newswire (10/21/000).52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricitygeneration and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation byunplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrivedand artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect ofartificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices abovecompetitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting tobillions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of theAntitrust Act (Against All Defendants)53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: \"Except as provided inthis chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.\"   Atrust is defined at o16720 as follows:555. \"A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or morepersons for any of the following purposes:(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price ofmerchandise or of any commodity.&amp;copy; To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public orconsumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article orcommodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, useor consumption in this State.(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do allor any or any combination of the following: (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article orany commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce orconsumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity ortransportation at a fixed or graduated figure.(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity ortransportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly orindirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity.(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any intereststhat they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.\"56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750to commence a private action for up to three times their damages andequitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue tosuffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.   TheCartwright Act states:Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason ofanything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are \"persons\" within the meaning of theAntitrust Act as defined in o16702.58. Beginning on or about May 222, 2000, the exact date being presentlyunknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make availableand use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, anorganization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the marketprices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce inCalifornia. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts andentered into Agreements, which   were intended to and have in fact restrainedtrade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricitymarkets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuingto the present day. 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuingagreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, thesubstantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply ofelectricity to the California markets.   Through these acts and Agreements,Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on theReal Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers ofelectricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, atsupra-competitive prices.60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitivewholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 222, 2000, to the customersof the California Power Exchange.61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such asPlaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade andcommerce in California during the Class Period.63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unlessenjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitiveeffects, among others:(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesalepurchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&amp;E in California havebeen and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially highand non-competitive levels;(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricityand retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrainedand adversely affected; and&amp;copy; Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefitof free and open competition in the electricity market in California.64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentDefendants' unlawful conduct.65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.666. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly,Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoiningDefendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / / SECOND CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act(against all defendants)67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,which is defined as \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act orpractice,\" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,   oo167000 et seq.of the B&amp;P Code.69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendantsunlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restraincompetition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 167000 et seq.and oo 172000 et seq. of the B&amp;P Code.70. Pursuant to B&amp;P Code oo 172000 et seq., Plaintiff brings this actionseeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices andrequiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of theirviolations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentdefendants' unlawful conduct.72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, allegedherein, violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Classeek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all moniesobtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to thecontract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunctionenjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / /// / / THIRD CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and PracticesIn Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates(against all defendants)74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.75. Section 172000 et seq. of the California Business &amp; Professions Codeprohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any \"unlawful, unfair,or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue ormisleading advertising\".76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of   \"unfaircompetition\", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating theprice of wholesale electricity in the California markets.777. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:\"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility foror in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject tothe jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable andany such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declaredto be unlawful.\"16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in theforegoing statute.79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants chargedfor the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during theClass Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.   The California PublicUtilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable pricesresulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in theCalifornia wholesale electricity market.80. As a result of the conduct described above, the   defendantsunlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and havebeen and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and themembers of the Class.   Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff andthe Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity atunjust, excessive, and manipulated prices./ / / 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtrestoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them aclaim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as torestore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and thegeneral public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair anddeceptive acts and practices.82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtproviding appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restrainingdefendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulatingthe electricity markets. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Against All Defendants)83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer LegalRemedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.   Defendants' acts warrantappropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunctionrestraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating themarket for electricity.FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTIONUnconscionability(Against All Defendants)85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that wereunconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent marketsfor that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.87. Defendants' rates were   inherently   excessive, invalid andunconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulativepractices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital needconsumers and businesses have for electrical power./ / / 888. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiffand the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged bySDG&amp;E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class. VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEFWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants asfollows:(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as aclass action and direct that reasonable   notice of this action be given tothe members of the Class;(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracyand trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonablerestraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of theCalifornia Business and Professions Code;&amp;copy; That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff andthe Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgmentinterest;(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitablerelief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief asthe Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.Dated: November 27,   2000   KRAUSE &amp;KALFAYAN___James C.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon theinvestigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows: I. NATURE OF THE CASE1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of Californiafor defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.   During thespring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated theCalifornia wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflatedwholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the WesternUnited States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, andmaintenance data, and transmission system flow data to \"game\" the wholesaleelectricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from theCalifornia Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking powerwith affiliates in other states which was later resold in California atinflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincidewith other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by schedulingtransmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation ofthe California Tariff by which   defendants are authorized to sell wholesaleelectricity within California.3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants havedirectly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through theCalifornia Power Exchange.   As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune:   \"The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego areexorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19cents per kilowatt hour in just three months --- nothing short ofconfiscatory rates.\" 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (\"FERC\") expressly found that electricity prices in Californiahave been maintained at \"unjust and unreasonable\" levels during the relevantperiod, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandaterefunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.   In its November222, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California PublicUtilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation bywholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity suppliedthrough the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4billion dollars during the summer of 2000.   In its November 222nd response tothe November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, knownas the \"power grid\", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from theexercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders. II. VENUE5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in theState of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawfulmanipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San DiegoCounty.II. PARTIES6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,California.   Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer ofSDG&amp;E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the ClassPeriod (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have beenartificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.   Moreover, plaintiff PamelaR. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lackof circulation.   Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff PamelaR. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe healthconsequences.   As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon mustmaintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and71 degrees during the day.   Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable toterminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust andunfair rates for electricity from SDG&amp;E as a result of defendants'misconduct.   Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon was charged and/orpaid the following rates for electricity by SDG&amp;E during the Class Period:/ / /// / /// / /// / /DatesTotal Electric Charges5-26 to 6-27-000$180.926-27 to 7-27-000$2226.6777-28 to 8-28-000$3111.848-28 to 9-27-000$143.489-27 to 10-26-000$84.717.

Williams Energy Marketing andTrading Company operates three electricity generating plants in southernCalifornia which supply wholesale electricity to the California PowerExchange.14. Defendant Duke Energy North America (hereinafter \"Duke Energy\") is aHouston, Texas based public corporation doing business in the state ofCalifornia as Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC, a generator and traderof wholesale electricity which is ultimately sold to California consumers,including plaintiffs and the class, and a WSCC member. Duke Energy operatesfour electricity generating plants in California which supply wholesaleelectricity to the California Power Exchange. 15. Defendants DOES 1 through 1000, inclusive, are sued herein underfictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amendthis complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each ofthe fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for theoccurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries anddamages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.   Further, Plaintiff is informed andbelieves, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of theDefendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefitedfrom the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately causedinjury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below. IV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code ofCivil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,including the retail customers of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company (SDG&amp;E),who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchangeduring the period from May 222, 2000 through and including the date of trial(hereinafter the \"Class Period\").   All such persons and entities have paidand/or have been charged prices for electricity that were \"unjust andunreasonable\" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,manipulations, and unlawful actions.   Members of the Class are extremelynumerous and their joinder would be impracticable.   Approximately 1.2million SDG&amp;E customers are within the class.17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,including:-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharingconfidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter\"gamed\" the market;-whether defendants charged \"unjust and unreasonable\" prices for electricityduring the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price forelectricity;-whether defendants exercised \"market power\" in the California electricitymarket during the Class Period;-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should berefunded and paid to members of the Class.18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, theinterests of the class.19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class actionand consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute thisaction.20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair andefficient adjudication of this controversy.   The size of the individualdamages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of thedefendants' operations and alleged misconduct.   A class action is the onlymethod whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress andobtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipateany difficulty with the management of this action./ / /   V. COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACTA. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets21. In 19996 California deregulated its electricity industry and requiredthe State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of theirgenerating plants.   The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competitioninto the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates forelectrical power.   In fact, however, certain participants in this recentlyderegulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, takenadvantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtainedconfidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices forelectricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits atthe expense of California consumers.222. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created tofacilitate the workings of this new market.   California's investor ownedutilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), Southern California Edison (SCE),and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) (the\"Utilities\"), now purchaseelectricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,including defendants, through a market known as the California PowerExchange (PX).   The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale ofwholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real timemarkets.   Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX andprohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator (CAISO).   The CAISO is an \"independent\"non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representativesfrom among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flowof electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltagepower lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through theCAISO managed   \"power grid\".   The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply ofpower to meet that demand./ / / 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time ImbalanceMarket (the \"Real Time Market\").   When the CAISO receives bids fromsuppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must acceptany bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under thesingle price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity inthe Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, whichis the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willingto sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. Thismechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, togame the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearingprice.25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supplyand demand.   Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of thedaily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacityto the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place toobtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is usedto balance supply and demand of electricity.   Sellers in the ReplacementReserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.   Ifcalled upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement ReserveMarket also receive the Real Time Market price.   Thus, if generators knowthat capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from thespot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement ReserveMarket.   Access to real time generating information facilitates such\"gaming\" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competingsupply.27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchaseenergy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative pricecap.   The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.   Californiagenerators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets inorder to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the Californiamarkets.   They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated anduncapped prices.   As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,2000 Report (\"the PX Compliance Report\"):/ / / \"During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above theReal-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to exportenergy out of California.   Surrounding control areas can effectively parkthat energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to thestate.\"Id. at p. 444.28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increasein exports from   the California energy market, despite the very high pricesand short supplies that existed in the State.   \"Market power\" is defined by the CAISO as the ability tosignificantly influence market prices and cause them to vary fromcompetitive levels for a material period of time.   Generators and suppliers(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically oreconomically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity outof the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources inways that impede the efficiency of the market.29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively smallnumber of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the totalgenerating capacity.   The small number of suppliers facilitates the exerciseof   market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not atrue scarcity of available generating capacity.   In addition, the relativelyinelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such marketpower.B. Defendants' Improper Acts30. Prior to May 222, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western SystemsCoordinating Council (\"WSCC\"), an organization consisting of electricindustry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data asto electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmissionsystem flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual marketparticipants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricitymarket participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given accessto real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to suchdata was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.   When requested by variousgovernmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission(\"CPUC\") the WSCC refused access./ / /// / /// / / 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;Meter Data supplied by an ISO   metered entity shall be made available by theISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity andother authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shallnot be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required bylaw, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISOTariff.32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data andinformation provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated asconfidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that isexplicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 ofthis ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participantproviding the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISOTariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shallcomply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) informationthat becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other thanas a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).333. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinatorsshall be treated by the ISO as confidential:(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are notdesignated by the scheduling coordinator as available;&amp;copy; individual bids for Ancillary Services;(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes achange to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the shortterm (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the nameof that Generator.34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISOor to review any documents, data or other information of another MarketParticipant to the extent such documents, data or information is to betreated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a marketParticipant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and otherinformation that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose suchconfidential data or information relating to an individual MarketParticipant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information asprovided for in its bylaws. 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring &amp; InformationProtocol (MMIP).   The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth theworkplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets toidentify abuses of market power.   The MMIP part of the tariff applies to allISO Market Participants, including Defendants.36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departssignificantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do notrequire continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual orunexplained market outcomes.   Evidence of such behavior may be derived froma number of circumstances, including:MMIP 2.1.1.1   withholding of generation capacity under circumstances inwhich it would normally be offered in a competitive market;MMIP 2.1.1.2   unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability byGenerators;MMIP 2.1.1.3   unusual trades or transactions;MMIP 2.1.1.4   pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent withprevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appearconsistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;andMMIP 2.1.1.5   unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from orexports to other markets or exchanges.The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whetherthe continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates thepresence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort theoperation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., thestrategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicatesthe presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptablepractices.37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:\"Gaming\", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forthin the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmissionconstraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to thedetriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.\"Gaming\" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions thatmay affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such asloop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limitson energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that mayotherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to pricemanipulation to the detriment of their efficiency. 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, toshare access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact thatits publication and use violated the   ISO's operating procedures, as setforth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,and by adoption made part of the contracts by   which defendants wereauthorized to sell electricity to the PX.   Those tariffs and protocolsrequired that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the marketand not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitivebehavior.39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October19, 2000, that:\"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports fromthe state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesaleelectricity market, according to an official with the Western SystemsCoordinating Council. * * * * * * *\"At issue is real-time information the California Independent SystemOperator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the westernU.S., about power plant activity in the state.\"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access datavia an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 2000megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .\"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability onthe grid . . . .\"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data isbeing used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,director of dispatch with the WSCC. * * * * * *\"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply anddrive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particularregion and use that to gouge customers.\"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid andreal-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required tokeep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told theWSCC.\"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information   to theWSCC or other market participants.\" 40. Starting on or about May 222, 2000, Defendants used such real timedata to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exportingelectricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market priceand other market prices.   As a direct result of their improper access to anduse of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharplyupwards on May 222, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated pricesever since.   FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all nowconcluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:\"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded thatthey held back from full production of electricity in June, even as pricesskyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies toprevent blackouts.\"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clearevidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA werecreating an artificial shortage to drive up prices. * * * * * *McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that theEncina plant in Carlsbad generated 444 percent of the megawatt hours that itcould have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost ofproduction.   The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percentof what would be expected under traditional economic theory.Economists estimate it costs $45-$555 per megawatt hour to generateelectricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 permegawatt hour.A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed \"mysteriouscutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.\" * * *** *\"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence thatelectricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's marketthis summer before they would commit their power plants to production.\"\"\"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to JimDetmers, the ISO's operations chief.\" 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about theircompetitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forwardmarkets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need tobalance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from thesingle price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any givenperiod.   In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity withaffiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in theCalifornia markets.   They then sold that electricity back into theCalifornia markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity marketto purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated SpotMarket, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. TheSpot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in thedemand for energy.C. Results of Defendants' Activities43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities haveraised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the ratesthat would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to thecosts of generating that electricity.   Those prices have resulted in anapproximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&amp;E, whereretail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a passthrough of SDG&amp;E's costs for such power, which it purchases from thedefendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.444. As the Market Surveillance Committee (\"MSC\") of the CAISO concludedin its September 6, 2000 Report (\"the MSC Report\"), during the months of Mayand June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energymarket were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would havebeen generated under competitive pricing conditions.   MSC Report at p. 2.The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a\"significant amount of   market power\" in the California energy markets,beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during theClass Period.   Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale marketsduring August of 2000 was $1666.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.   While load demand conditions inCalifornia during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, theywere similar to those during August 19998 when prices were much lower.   Peakdemand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior twoyears, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demandcaused these price increases.   Indeed, some California electricity producerswere only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods. 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of thenight, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.   Further, prices inNovember 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during thesummer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitivemarketplace.47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, theyartificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained hugewindfall profits.   As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune,   analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricityindustry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.Feygin stated, \"'The industry was literally at eight times the profitabilityof last year . . ... that is a fortune.'\"48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings willtop last year's figure by about $1110 million.   Similarly, defendant Dynegyreported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, ascompared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from DefendantDynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.\"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history\", reported chairmanand chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.   Other defendants alsoobtained large windfall profits during this period.49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatthour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Marketprice of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resultingin an approximate tripling of SDG&amp;E customers' bills.50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded thatwholesale prices of electricity in California had been at \"unjust andunreasonable\" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses tothe November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices duringSummer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generatorsand traders. 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated andinflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customersof SDG&amp;E since costs were fully passed through to them.   The CPUC's November222, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power bywholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for thedelivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.   Due to theunlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. AsCongressman Brian Bilbray stated: \"Every day that goes by you've got smallbusinesses bleeding to death.   People are literally dying financially fromthis situation.\"   Work.com Newswire (10/21/000).52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricitygeneration and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation byunplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrivedand artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect ofartificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices abovecompetitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting tobillions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of theAntitrust Act (Against All Defendants)53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: \"Except as provided inthis chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.\"   Atrust is defined at o16720 as follows:555. \"A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or morepersons for any of the following purposes:(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price ofmerchandise or of any commodity.&amp;copy; To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public orconsumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article orcommodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, useor consumption in this State.(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do allor any or any combination of the following: (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article orany commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce orconsumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity ortransportation at a fixed or graduated figure.(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity ortransportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly orindirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity.(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any intereststhat they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.\"56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750to commence a private action for up to three times their damages andequitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue tosuffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.   TheCartwright Act states:Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason ofanything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are \"persons\" within the meaning of theAntitrust Act as defined in o16702.58. Beginning on or about May 222, 2000, the exact date being presentlyunknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make availableand use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, anorganization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the marketprices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce inCalifornia. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts andentered into Agreements, which   were intended to and have in fact restrainedtrade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricitymarkets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuingto the present day. 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuingagreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, thesubstantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply ofelectricity to the California markets.   Through these acts and Agreements,Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on theReal Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers ofelectricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, atsupra-competitive prices.60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitivewholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 222, 2000, to the customersof the California Power Exchange.61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such asPlaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade andcommerce in California during the Class Period.63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unlessenjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitiveeffects, among others:(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesalepurchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&amp;E in California havebeen and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially highand non-competitive levels;(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricityand retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrainedand adversely affected; and&amp;copy; Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefitof free and open competition in the electricity market in California.64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentDefendants' unlawful conduct.65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.666. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly,Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoiningDefendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / / SECOND CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act(against all defendants)67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,which is defined as \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act orpractice,\" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,   oo167000 et seq.of the B&amp;P Code.69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendantsunlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restraincompetition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 167000 et seq.and oo 172000 et seq. of the B&amp;P Code.70. Pursuant to B&amp;P Code oo 172000 et seq., Plaintiff brings this actionseeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices andrequiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of theirviolations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentdefendants' unlawful conduct.72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, allegedherein, violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Classeek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all moniesobtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to thecontract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunctionenjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / /// / / THIRD CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and PracticesIn Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates(against all defendants)74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.75. Section 172000 et seq. of the California Business &amp; Professions Codeprohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any \"unlawful, unfair,or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue ormisleading advertising\".76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of   \"unfaircompetition\", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating theprice of wholesale electricity in the California markets.777. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:\"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility foror in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject tothe jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable andany such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declaredto be unlawful.\"16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in theforegoing statute.79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants chargedfor the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during theClass Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.   The California PublicUtilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable pricesresulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in theCalifornia wholesale electricity market.80. As a result of the conduct described above, the   defendantsunlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and havebeen and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and themembers of the Class.   Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff andthe Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity atunjust, excessive, and manipulated prices./ / / 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtrestoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them aclaim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as torestore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and thegeneral public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair anddeceptive acts and practices.82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtproviding appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restrainingdefendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulatingthe electricity markets. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Against All Defendants)83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer LegalRemedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.   Defendants' acts warrantappropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunctionrestraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating themarket for electricity.FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTIONUnconscionability(Against All Defendants)85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that wereunconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent marketsfor that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.87. Defendants' rates were   inherently   excessive, invalid andunconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulativepractices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital needconsumers and businesses have for electrical power./ / / 888. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiffand the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged bySDG&amp;E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class. VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEFWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants asfollows:(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as aclass action and direct that reasonable   notice of this action be given tothe members of the Class;(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracyand trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonablerestraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of theCalifornia Business and Professions Code;&amp;copy; That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff andthe Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgmentinterest;(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitablerelief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief asthe Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.Dated: November 27,   2000   KRAUSE &amp;KALFAYAN___James C.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 21 Plaintiff hereby alleges on information and belief based upon theinvestigation made by and through her attorneys, as follows: I. NATURE OF THE CASE1. This is a class action seeking redress under the law of Californiafor defendants' conduct in the market for wholesale electricity.   During thespring and summer of 2000, a group of electricity generators and traders,including defendants, exercising market power, unlawfully manipulated theCalifornia wholesale electricity market, resulting in grossly inflatedwholesale electricity prices throughout the state and much of the WesternUnited States. Defendants accomplished this result by, inter alia,improperly using confidential real time generator capacity, use, andmaintenance data, and transmission system flow data to \"game\" the wholesaleelectricity market, by withholding electrical generating capacity from theCalifornia Power Exchange's forward markets, by improperly parking powerwith affiliates in other states which was later resold in California atinflated rates, by scheduling previously unplanned plant outages to coincidewith other plants' planned maintenance shutdowns, and by schedulingtransmission flows to cause or exacerbate congestion.2. The improper use of confidential real time data was in violation ofthe California Tariff by which   defendants are authorized to sell wholesaleelectricity within California.3. By engaging in said unfair business practices, defendants havedirectly and severely damaged purchasers of electricity supplied through theCalifornia Power Exchange.   As noted in the August 30, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune:   \"The utility bills of all [electric] ratepayers in San Diego areexorbitant. . . . Rates that were 3 cents per kilowatt hour have risen to 19cents per kilowatt hour in just three months --- nothing short ofconfiscatory rates.\" 4. In its November 1, 2000 Order, the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommission (\"FERC\") expressly found that electricity prices in Californiahave been maintained at \"unjust and unreasonable\" levels during the relevantperiod, though it determined that it did not have the authority to mandaterefunds or other retroactive relief with respect thereto.   In its November222, 2000 response to the November 1st FERC order, the California PublicUtilities Commission (CPUC) concluded that due to market manipulation bywholesale energy producers and traders, customers of electricity suppliedthrough the California Power Exchange had been overcharged more than $4billion dollars during the summer of 2000.   In its November 222nd response tothe November 1st FERC order, even the California Independent System Operator(CAISO) which manages California's transmission system infrastructure, knownas the \"power grid\", found that the summer 2000 prices resulted from theexercise of intolerable levels of market power by generators and traders. II. VENUE5. Venue is proper because defendants each transact business in theState of California and because the damages caused by defendants' unlawfulmanipulation of the price of wholesale electricity occurred in San DiegoCounty.II. PARTIES6. Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is an adult resident living in San Diego,California.   Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is a retail electricity customer ofSDG&amp;E, and has been forced to pay rates for electricity during the ClassPeriod (defined infra) that are unjust and unfair and that have beenartificially inflated by defendants' misconduct.   Moreover, plaintiff PamelaR. Gordon was born with no lymph nodes in her legs which results in a lackof circulation.   Exposure to high temperatures will cause plaintiff PamelaR. Gordon's legs to swell, which can lead to possible severe healthconsequences.   As a result of her condition, plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon mustmaintain her home at temperatures of not more than 67 degrees at night and71 degrees during the day.   Plaintiff Pamela R. Gordon is unable toterminate her electricity service and has been forced to pay unjust andunfair rates for electricity from SDG&amp;E as a result of defendants'misconduct.   Specifically, plaintiff Pamela R.

Defendants DOES 1 through 1000, inclusive, are sued herein underfictitious names because their true names are unknown to the Plaintiff.When their true names and capacities are ascertained, Plaintiff will amendthis complaint by substituting their true names and capacities herein.Plaintiff is informed and believe, and based thereon alleges, that each ofthe fictitiously named Defendants is responsible in some manner for theoccurrences herein alleged, and thereby proximately caused injuries anddamages to Plaintiff, as herein alleged.   Further, Plaintiff is informed andbelieves, and upon such information and belief alleges, that each of theDefendants designated by a fictitious name participated in and/or benefitedfrom the wrongful acts, conduct, and omissions described in this complaint,and that said acts, conduct, and omissions directly and proximately causedinjury and damages to Plaintiff and the class as alleged below. IV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS16. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Section 382 of the Code ofCivil Procedure as a class action on behalf of all electricity customers,including the retail customers of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company (SDG&amp;E),who purchased electricity supplied through the California Power Exchangeduring the period from May 222, 2000 through and including the date of trial(hereinafter the \"Class Period\").   All such persons and entities have paidand/or have been charged prices for electricity that were \"unjust andunreasonable\" and that were artificially inflated due to defendants'exercise of market power, improper use of confidential information,manipulations, and unlawful actions.   Members of the Class are extremelynumerous and their joinder would be impracticable.   Approximately 1.2million SDG&amp;E customers are within the class.17. Common issues of fact and law predominate over individual issues,including:-whether defendants committed unfair business practices by sharingconfidential real time data in violation of ISO Tariffs and thereafter\"gamed\" the market;-whether defendants charged \"unjust and unreasonable\" prices for electricityduring the Class Period or otherwise benefited from said inflated price forelectricity;-whether defendants exercised \"market power\" in the California electricitymarket during the Class Period;-whether defendants received improper and excess profits which should berefunded and paid to members of the Class.18. Plaintiff's interests are typical of, and not antagonistic to, theinterests of the class.19. Plaintiff has retained competent counsel experienced in class actionand consumer fraud litigation and intends to vigorously prosecute thisaction.20. A class action is superior to all other methods for the fair andefficient adjudication of this controversy.   The size of the individualdamages is small in comparison to the complexity and scope of thedefendants' operations and alleged misconduct.   A class action is the onlymethod whereby plaintiff and the class can efficiently seek redress andobtain a uniform adjudication of their claims. Plaintiff does not anticipateany difficulty with the management of this action./ / /   V. COMMON ALLEGATIONS OF FACTA. The California Wholesale Electricity Markets21. In 19996 California deregulated its electricity industry and requiredthe State's privately owned utility companies to divest themselves of theirgenerating plants.   The purpose of deregulation was to introduce competitioninto the electricity markets, with the intention of reducing rates forelectrical power.   In fact, however, certain participants in this recentlyderegulated industry have, in violation of their operating Tariff, takenadvantage of structural flaws in the system and improperly obtainedconfidential competitor information to artificially inflate prices forelectricity, yielding themselves billions of dollars in windfall profits atthe expense of California consumers.222. As part of the deregulation, several new entities were created tofacilitate the workings of this new market.   California's investor ownedutilities, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E), Southern California Edison (SCE),and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SDG&amp;E) (the\"Utilities\"), now purchaseelectricity for their customers from independent generators and traders,including defendants, through a market known as the California PowerExchange (PX).   The PX maintains a market for the purchase and sale ofwholesale electricity through a variety of forward contracts and real timemarkets.   Under the California deregulatory scheme, the Utilities were,until just recently, required to purchase power through the PX andprohibited from independently contracting for power outside this market.23. The deregulated market also led to the creation of the CaliforniaIndependent System Operator (CAISO).   The CAISO is an \"independent\"non-profit corporation, though its managing board includes representativesfrom among the generators and traders, that was created to manage the flowof electricity and ensure reliability along the long distance, high-voltagepower lines that make up the bulk of California's transmission system.Approximately 75% of California's electricity is distributed through theCAISO managed   \"power grid\".   The CAISO monitors electrical loads (i.e.,demand) on an on-going basis and ensures that there is an adequate supply ofpower to meet that demand./ / / 24. The CAISO accomplishes this by maintaining a Real Time ImbalanceMarket (the \"Real Time Market\").   When the CAISO receives bids fromsuppliers that are insufficient to meet the demand for power, it must acceptany bid, which then sets the market-clearing price for that hour. Under thesingle price auction system used by the CAISO, all sellers of electricity inthe Real Time Market automatically receive the market clearing price, whichis the (second) highest price paid in the market, even if they were willingto sell and had in fact bid to sell electricity at lower prices. Thismechanism allows sophisticated market participants, such as defendants, togame the market by withholding bids in an effort to maximize the clearingprice.25. The Real Time Market was not designed to handle large transactions,but merely to provide a mechanism to correct short term imbalances in supplyand demand.   Defendants nonetheless pushed a substantial portion of thedaily wholesale electricity sales into this market by under bidding capacityto the forward market leaving wholesale customers no alternative place toobtain the power to satisfy their retail customers' demand.26. The CAISO also manages the Replacement Reserve Market, which is usedto balance supply and demand of electricity.   Sellers in the ReplacementReserve Market receive a fixed premium for having available capacity.   Ifcalled upon by the ISO to deliver energy, sellers in the Replacement ReserveMarket also receive the Real Time Market price.   Thus, if generators knowthat capacity is short, they have an incentive to withhold supplies from thespot markets and push as much as possible into the Replacement ReserveMarket.   Access to real time generating information facilitates such\"gaming\" of the markets by demonstrating, in real time, available competingsupply.27. In times of high demand, the CAISO has the authority to purchaseenergy from out-of-state sources, as to which there is no operative pricecap.   The CAISO was forced to do so during the Summer of 2000.   Californiagenerators and marketers can export electricity to surrounding markets inorder to create artificial shortages and drive up prices in the Californiamarkets.   They can then resell that electricity to the CAISO at inflated anduncapped prices.   As the PX Compliance Committee noted in its November 1,2000 Report (\"the PX Compliance Report\"):/ / / \"During periods of high Out-of-Market purchases, when prices are above theReal-Time energy price cap, in-state generators have an incentive to exportenergy out of California.   Surrounding control areas can effectively parkthat energy for resale to the CAISO Out-of-Market calls and return it to thestate.\"Id. at p. 444.28. Notably, the summer of 2000 witnessed an approximately 370% increasein exports from   the California energy market, despite the very high pricesand short supplies that existed in the State.   \"Market power\" is defined by the CAISO as the ability tosignificantly influence market prices and cause them to vary fromcompetitive levels for a material period of time.   Generators and suppliers(including defendants) can exercise market power by physically oreconomically withholding electricity from the market, moving electricity outof the California markets, and by pricing and bidding their resources inways that impede the efficiency of the market.29. Notably, the California energy market consists of a relatively smallnumber of firms, some of which control a substantial fraction of the totalgenerating capacity.   The small number of suppliers facilitates the exerciseof   market power during periods of high demand, even when there is not atrue scarcity of available generating capacity.   In addition, the relativelyinelastic demand for energy further facilitates the exercise of such marketpower.B. Defendants' Improper Acts30. Prior to May 222, 2000, the CAISO began supplying the Western SystemsCoordinating Council (\"WSCC\"), an organization consisting of electricindustry participants, including defendants, with real time industry data asto electricity generating levels, known as metering data, and transmissionsystem flow data, known as scheduling data, pertaining to individual marketparticipants. Through the WSCC Internet web site, wholesale electricitymarket participants, including defendants herein, were thereby given accessto real time data as to their competitors' actions, although access to suchdata was forbidden by the ISO Tariff.   When requested by variousgovernmental entities, including the California Public Utilities Commission(\"CPUC\") the WSCC refused access./ / /// / /// / / 31. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 10.2.6 states in relevant part;Meter Data supplied by an ISO   metered entity shall be made available by theISO to the scheduling coordinator representing such ISO metered entity andother authorized users identified in its meter services agreement, but shallnot be disclosed to any third party except as otherwise may be required bylaw, FERC any local regulatory authority or other provision of this ISOTariff.32. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.1 states in relevant part:The ISO shall maintain the confidentiality of all of the documents, data andinformation provided to it by any Market Participant that are treated asconfidential or commercially sensitive under Section 20.3.2; provided,however, that the ISO need not keep confidential: (1) information that isexplicitly subject to data exchange through WEnet pursuant to Section 6 ofthis ISO Tariff; (2) information that the ISO or the Market Participantproviding the information is required to disclose pursuant to this ISOTariff, or applicable regulatory requirements (provided that the ISO shallcomply with any applicable limits on such disclosure); or (3) informationthat becomes available to the public on a non-confidential basis (other thanas a result of the ISO's breach of this ISO Tariff).333. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:The following information provided to the ISO by Scheduling Coordinatorsshall be treated by the ISO as confidential:(a) individual bids for Supplemental Energy;(b) individual Adjustment Bids for Congestion Management which are notdesignated by the scheduling coordinator as available;&amp;copy; individual bids for Ancillary Services;(d) transactions between Scheduling Coordinators;(e) individual Generator Outage programs unless a Generator makes achange to its Generator Outage program which causes Congestion in the shortterm (i.e. one month or less), in which case, the ISO may publish the nameof that Generator.34. CAISO/FERC Tariff section 20.3.2 states in relevant part:No Market Participant shall have the right hereunder to receive from the ISOor to review any documents, data or other information of another MarketParticipant to the extent such documents, data or information is to betreated as in accordance with Section 20.3.2; provided, however, a marketParticipant may receive and review any composite documents, data, and otherinformation that may be developed based upon such confidential documents,data, or information, if the composite document does not disclose suchconfidential data or information relating to an individual MarketParticipant and provided, however, that the ISO may disclose information asprovided for in its bylaws. 35. Part of the CAISO Tariff is the ISO Market Monitoring &amp; InformationProtocol (MMIP).   The objective of this Protocol (MMIP) is to set forth theworkplan and rules under which the ISO will monitor the ISO markets toidentify abuses of market power.   The MMIP part of the tariff applies to allISO Market Participants, including Defendants.36. MMIP Section 2.1.1. states in relevant part:Anomalous market behavior, which is defined as behavior that departssignificantly from the normal behavior in competitive markets that do notrequire continuing regulation or as behavior leading to unusual orunexplained market outcomes.   Evidence of such behavior may be derived froma number of circumstances, including:MMIP 2.1.1.1   withholding of generation capacity under circumstances inwhich it would normally be offered in a competitive market;MMIP 2.1.1.2   unexplained or unusual redeclarations of availability byGenerators;MMIP 2.1.1.3   unusual trades or transactions;MMIP 2.1.1.4   pricing and bidding patterns that are inconsistent withprevailing supply and demand conditions, e.g., prices and bids that appearconsistently excessive for or otherwise inconsistent with such conditions;andMMIP 2.1.1.5   unusual activity or circumstances relating to imports from orexports to other markets or exchanges.The Market Surveillance Unit shall evaluate, on an ongoing basis, whetherthe continued or persistent presence of such circumstances indicates thepresence of behavior that is designed to or has the potential to distort theoperation and efficient functioning of a competitive market, e.g., thestrategic withholding and redeclaring of capacity, and whether it indicatesthe presence and exercise of market power or of other unacceptablepractices.37. MMIP Section 2.1.3 states in relevant part:\"Gaming\", or taking unfair advantage of the rules and procedures set forthin the PX or ISO Tariffs, Protocols or Activity Rules, or of transmissionconstraints in periods in which exist substantial Congestion, to thedetriment of the efficiency of, and of consumers in, the ISO Markets.\"Gaming\" may also include taking undue advantage of other conditions thatmay affect the availability of transmission and generation capacity, such asloop flow, facility outages, level of hydropower output or seasonal limitson energy imports from out-of-state, or actions or behaviors that mayotherwise render the system and the ISO markets vulnerable to pricemanipulation to the detriment of their efficiency. 38. Market participants used their trade organization, the WSCC, toshare access to and use real time information, notwithstanding the fact thatits publication and use violated the   ISO's operating procedures, as setforth in tariffs and protocols that were filed with and approved by FERC,and by adoption made part of the contracts by   which defendants wereauthorized to sell electricity to the PX.   Those tariffs and protocolsrequired that such data be kept confidential to prevent gaming the marketand not be used by market participants to engage in anti-competitivebehavior.39. It has been reported in the Dow Jones Work. Com Newswire on October19, 2000, that:\"Electricity generators may have used real-time plant activity reports fromthe state's grid operator to their advantage in California's wholesaleelectricity market, according to an official with the Western SystemsCoordinating Council. * * * * * * *\"At issue is real-time information the California Independent SystemOperator provided the Western systems Coordinating Council, a governmental[sic] organization that monitors electricity reliability in the westernU.S., about power plant activity in the state.\"The real-time information allows market participants . . . to access datavia an internet site that shows how much capacity a plant with more than 2000megawatts has online at any given moment. . . . .\"The information was intended to be used to monitor electric reliability onthe grid . . . .\"Last month, however, the ISO's attorneys alerted the WSCC that the 'data isbeing used against them and to game the market,' according to Bill Commish,director of dispatch with the WSCC. * * * * * *\"Commish said generators could use the information to withhold supply anddrive up power prices or to identify transmission congestion in a particularregion and use that to gouge customers.\"However, the ISO, which controls about 75% of the state's power grid andreal-time market, may have violated a FERC rule because it is required tokeep such information confidential for 90 days, an ISO attorney told theWSCC.\"Beginning Monday, the ISO will no longer provide such information   to theWSCC or other market participants.\" 40. Starting on or about May 222, 2000, Defendants used such real timedata to exercise market power by, among other things, reducing their output,strategically under-bidding supply to the forward markets, and exportingelectricity from the State in order to drive up the Real Time Market priceand other market prices.   As a direct result of their improper access to anduse of this information, the price of wholesale electricity spiked sharplyupwards on May 222, 2000 and has remained at artificially inflated pricesever since.   FERC, CPUC, and CAISO Dept. of Market Analysis, have all nowconcluded that market participants should be excluded from the CAISO board.41. As noted in the North County Times on October 19, 2000:\"A case study of San Diego County's two big power plants has concluded thatthey held back from full production of electricity in June, even as pricesskyrocketed and California's power manager was scrambling for supplies toprevent blackouts.\"To the study's author . . . the low production in San Diego county is clearevidence that the companies that generate and trade electricity in CA werecreating an artificial shortage to drive up prices. * * * * * *McCullough's hour-by-hour analysis of power output for June found that theEncina plant in Carlsbad generated 444 percent of the megawatt hours that itcould have during periods when prices were higher than the plant's cost ofproduction.   The South Bay power plant in Chula Vista generated 61 percentof what would be expected under traditional economic theory.Economists estimate it costs $45-$555 per megawatt hour to generateelectricity at the plants. The wholesale price in June averaged $120 permegawatt hour.A separate analysis conducted by the North County Times revealed \"mysteriouscutbacks in Carlsbad during a heady market of sky-high prices.\" * * *** *\"Investigators and market analysts have documented extensive evidence thatelectricity traders have waited until prices rose on California's marketthis summer before they would commit their power plants to production.\"\"\"'We did see evidence of withholding in the bidding,' according to JimDetmers, the ISO's operations chief.\" 42. In addition, defendants used such real time information about theircompetitors to improperly withhold electrical supplies from the forwardmarkets operated by the PX in order to take advantage of the ISO's need tobalance supply and demand in the spot market and thereby benefit from thesingle price auction system by obtaining the highest price paid at any givenperiod.   In addition, certain defendants sold or parked electricity withaffiliates in other states in order to artificially drive up prices in theCalifornia markets.   They then sold that electricity back into theCalifornia markets at the artificially inflated prices they had created.These tactics forced buyers in the California wholesale electricity marketto purchase more than 30% of their electricity needs in the inflated SpotMarket, rather than the less than 5% that should be sold in that market. TheSpot Market was solely intended to satisfy last minute fluctuations in thedemand for energy.C. Results of Defendants' Activities43. From late May 2000 through the present, defendants' activities haveraised wholesale electricity prices to record levels, well above the ratesthat would prevail in a competitive marketplace and disproportionate to thecosts of generating that electricity.   Those prices have resulted in anapproximate tripling of electricity rates in areas served by SDG&amp;E, whereretail rates have been deregulated and represent in large part a passthrough of SDG&amp;E's costs for such power, which it purchases from thedefendant generators and traders through the California Power Exchange.444. As the Market Surveillance Committee (\"MSC\") of the CAISO concludedin its September 6, 2000 Report (\"the MSC Report\"), during the months of Mayand June 2000 revenues from the sale of ISO loads in the California energymarket were 37% and 182%, respectively, above the revenues that would havebeen generated under competitive pricing conditions.   MSC Report at p. 2.The MSC Report unambiguously concluded that market participants exercised a\"significant amount of   market power\" in the California energy markets,beginning as early as October 1999 and increasing dramatically during theClass Period.   Id. at pp. 4, 15, 17.45. The average market clearing price in California's wholesale marketsduring August of 2000 was $1666.24/MWh under moderate load conditions,compared with $32.31/MWh a year earlier.   While load demand conditions inCalifornia during August 2000 were slightly higher than in August 1999, theywere similar to those during August 19998 when prices were much lower.   Peakdemand in August 2000 was lower than in August of either of the prior twoyears, negating representations by industry leaders that excessive demandcaused these price increases.   Indeed, some California electricity producerswere only running at 60% of capacity during the so-called emergency periods. 46. These price hikes have even been effect during the middle of thenight, when electricity is abundant and demand is low.   Further, prices inNovember 2000, when demand for electricity is much lower than during thesummer months, continue to be substantially in excess of the prior years'levels and in excess of the levels that should prevail in a competitivemarketplace.47. As a result of defendants' exercise of market power, theyartificially increased prices to record levels and have obtained hugewindfall profits.   As reported in the October 17, 2000 San Diego UnionTribune,   analyst Anatol Feygin of JP Morgan estimated that electricityindustry profits from California for the 3 months ended September 30, 2000could reach $6 billion, even after taking into account cost increases.Feygin stated, \"'The industry was literally at eight times the profitabilityof last year . . ... that is a fortune.'\"48. Defendant Reliant has reported that its third quarter earnings willtop last year's figure by about $1110 million.   Similarly, defendant Dynegyreported an 83 percent increase in its third quarter 2000 income, ascompared to its third quarter 1999 figures.   Profits from DefendantDynegy's wholesale energy generating and trading division quadrupled to$141.9 million, which represented 80 percent of Dynegy's overall profits.\"This is the most successful quarter in Dynegy's history\", reported chairmanand chief executive officer, Charles 'Chuck' Watson.   Other defendants alsoobtained large windfall profits during this period.49. Prior to deregulation, the historical cost to produce a megawatthour of electricity in San Diego County was approximately $23-45 per MWh.During the Summer of 2000, defendants' conduct caused the Real Time Marketprice of wholesale electricity to frequently reach $750 per MWh, resultingin an approximate tripling of SDG&amp;E customers' bills.50. In its Order issued on November 1, 2000, FERC concluded thatwholesale prices of electricity in California had been at \"unjust andunreasonable\" levels during the Summer of 2000. CAISO and CPUC responses tothe November 1st FERC order both concluded that wholesale prices duringSummer 2000 were due to a substantial exercise of market power by generatorsand traders. 51. Plaintiffs and the class were injured by the manipulated andinflated prices paid for wholesale electricity, including retail customersof SDG&amp;E since costs were fully passed through to them.   The CPUC's November222, 2000 report to FERC concluded that the exercise of market power bywholesale producers resulted in a $4 billion dollar overcharge for thedelivery of electricity to California during the summer of 2000.   Due to theunlawful conduct alleged above, plaintiffs and the class paid approximately$4 billion dollars more for electricity than they otherwise would have,causing great hardship to numerous individuals and businesses. AsCongressman Brian Bilbray stated: \"Every day that goes by you've got smallbusinesses bleeding to death.   People are literally dying financially fromthis situation.\"   Work.com Newswire (10/21/000).52. The improper sharing and use of real time wholesale electricitygeneration and transmission data by defendants to withhold generation byunplanned outages and to maintain bidding strategies which led to contrivedand artificial shortages, and other manipulative conduct, had the effect ofartificially inflating and maintaining wholesale electricity prices abovecompetitive prices allowing defendants to reap illegal profits amounting tobillions of dollars, at the expense of plaintiffs and the class. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of the California Business and Professions Code Trust In Restraint of Trade or Commerce in Violation of theAntitrust Act (Against All Defendants)53. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.54. The Cartwright Act states, at o16726, that: \"Except as provided inthis chapter, every trust is unlawful, against public policy and void.\"   Atrust is defined at o16720 as follows:555. \"A trust is a combination of capital, skill or acts by two or morepersons for any of the following purposes:(a) To create or carry out restrictions in trade or commerce.(b) To limit or reduce the production, or increase the price ofmerchandise or of any commodity.&amp;copy; To prevent competition in manufacturing, making, transportation,sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or any commodity.(d) To fix at any standard or figure, whereby its price to the public orconsumer shall be in any manner controlled or established, any article orcommodity of merchandise, produce or commerce intended for sale, barter, useor consumption in this State.(e) To make or enter into or execute or carry out any contracts,obligations, or agreements of any kind or description, by which they do allor any or any combination of the following: (1) Bind themselves not to sell, dispose of or transport any article orany commodity or any article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce orconsumption below a common standard figure, or fixed value.(2) Agree in any manner to keep the price of such article, commodity ortransportation at a fixed or graduated figure.(3) Establish or settle the price of any article, commodity ortransportation between them or themselves and others, so as directly orindirectly to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among themselves,or any purchasers or consumers in the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity.(4) Agree to pool, combine or directly or indirectly unite any intereststhat they may have connected with the sale or transportation of any sucharticle or commodity, that its price might in any manner be affected.\"56. Plaintiffs and the Class are empowered by the Cartwright Act o16750to commence a private action for up to three times their damages andequitable relief due to the injuries they have suffered and continue tosuffer as a result of defendants' violations of the Antitrust Act.   TheCartwright Act states:Any person who is injured in his or her business or property by reason ofanything forbidden or declared unlawful by this chapter, may sue therefore. . . and to recover three times the damages sustained by him or her,interest . . . and preliminary or permanent injunctive relief . . . .57. Plaintiffs and the Class, are \"persons\" within the meaning of theAntitrust Act as defined in o16702.58. Beginning on or about May 222, 2000, the exact date being presentlyunknown to Plaintiffs, Defendants embarked on a conspiracy to make availableand use confidential real time industry data as to electrical generating,power plant capacity, utilization, and outages through the WSCC, anorganization consisting of Defendants, and others, to inflate the marketprices of wholesale electricity, in restraint of trade and commerce inCalifornia. As a result of these efforts, Defendants engaged in acts andentered into Agreements, which   were intended to and have in fact restrainedtrade and commerce in the California Power Exchange and other electricitymarkets, in violation of the Antitrust Act, which violations are continuingto the present day. 59. The aforesaid acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce have consisted of continuingagreements, undertakings and concert of action among Defendants, thesubstantial terms of which were to artificially limit the supply ofelectricity to the California markets.   Through these acts and Agreements,Defendants acted to set, raise and maintain the prices of electricity on theReal Time Imbalance Market and other markets to wholesale purchasers ofelectricity, and, indirectly and ultimately, to California consumers, atsupra-competitive prices.60. Defendants successfully set, raised and maintained supra-competitivewholesale prices for electricity beginning on May 222, 2000, to the customersof the California Power Exchange.61. Such overcharges were paid by consumers of electricity, such asPlaintiff and the Class she seeks to represent.62. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, combinations andconspiracies were intended to restrain and did, in fact, restrain trade andcommerce in California during the Class Period.63. Defendants' unlawful restraints of trade have had and, unlessenjoined, threaten to continue to have the following anti-competitiveeffects, among others:(a) Prices charged by Defendants for electricity to wholesalepurchasers, and, ultimately, to the customers of SDG&amp;E in California havebeen and will continue to be set, raised and maintained at artificially highand non-competitive levels;(b) Fair and equitable price competition for the supply of electricityand retail and wholesale price levels for electricity have been restrainedand adversely affected; and&amp;copy; Plaintiff and other Class members have been deprived of the benefitof free and open competition in the electricity market in California.64. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentDefendants' unlawful conduct.65. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.666. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly,Plaintiff and the Class seek three times their damages caused by Defendants'violations of the Antitrust Act and a permanent injunction enjoiningDefendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / / SECOND CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Violations of the Antitrust Act(against all defendants)67. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.68. The Unfair Trade Practices Act prohibits all unfair competition,which is defined as \"any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act orpractice,\" and includes violations of the Cartwright Act,   oo167000 et seq.of the B&amp;P Code.69. As alleged hereinabove, beginning as early as May, 2000, defendantsunlawfully conspired, agreed, arranged and combined to prevent and restraincompetition for the sale of electricity, in violation of oo 167000 et seq.and oo 172000 et seq. of the B&amp;P Code.70. Pursuant to B&amp;P Code oo 172000 et seq., Plaintiff brings this actionseeking injunctive relief to enjoin defendants' unfair trade practices andrequiring defendants' disgorgement of all monies obtained by virtue of theirviolations of the Cartwright Act as described hereinabove.71. As a direct and proximate result of the violations alleged herein,Plaintiff and members of the Class have been unable to and will continue tobe unable to purchase electricity at prices determined by free and opencompetition, and Plaintiff and members of the Class have been damaged andwill continue to be damaged by their respective purchases and/or charges forelectricity at prices higher than they would have otherwise paid, absentdefendants' unlawful conduct.72. Plaintiff and the Class have no adequate remedy at law for theirirreparable injuries.73. Defendants' acts, contracts, agreements, conspiracies, andcombinations in restraint of trade and free and open competition, allegedherein, violate the Antitrust Act.   Accordingly, Plaintiff and the Classeek restitution and disgorgement by defendants to the Class of all moniesobtained by defendants' acts of unfair competition with respect to thecontract, conspiracy, combination and trust, and a permanent injunctionenjoining defendants' continuing violations of the Cartwright Act./ / /// / / THIRD CAUSE OF ACTIONFor Violations of the Unfair Trade Practices ActBased Upon Defendants' Unfair Business Acts and PracticesIn Charging Unjust and Unreasonable Rates(against all defendants)74. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.75. Section 172000 et seq. of the California Business &amp; Professions Codeprohibits acts of unfair competition, which include any \"unlawful, unfair,or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue ormisleading advertising\".76. The Defendants consistently engaged in numerous acts of   \"unfaircompetition\", as more fully described above, by inter alia, manipulating theprice of wholesale electricity in the California markets.777. In addition, pursuant to the Federal Power Act:\"All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any public utility foror in connection with the transmission or sale of electric energy subject tothe jurisdiction of the Commission . . . shall be just and reasonable andany such rate or charge that is not just and reasonable is hereby declaredto be unlawful.\"16 U.S.C. Section 824d(a).78. Defendants are public utilities within the term as used in theforegoing statute.79. The FERC has specifically found that the prices defendants chargedfor the wholesale electricity they sold in the California markets during theClass Period were in fact unjust and unreasonable.   The California PublicUtilities Commission has determined that said unjust and unreasonable pricesresulted from the exercise of market power by generators and traders in theCalifornia wholesale electricity market.80. As a result of the conduct described above, the   defendantsunlawfully acquired money and property from Plaintiff and the Class and havebeen and will be unjustly enriched at the expense of Plaintiff and themembers of the Class.   Specifically, defendants have deprived Plaintiff andthe Class of billions of dollars in monies from the sale of electricity atunjust, excessive, and manipulated prices./ / / 81. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtrestoring to them all money wrongfully taken from them and allowing them aclaim in the full amount of all of defendants' ill-gotten gains, so as torestore any and all monies to Plaintiff and the members of the Class and thegeneral public, which were acquired and obtained by means of such unfair anddeceptive acts and practices.82. Pursuant to Section 17203 of the California Business &amp; ProfessionsCode, Plaintiff and the members of the class seek an order of this Courtproviding appropriate equitable and/or injunctive relief restrainingdefendants from charging unjust and unreasonable rates and from manipulatingthe electricity markets. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION Violations of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (Against All Defendants)83. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.84. Such acts and practices by defendants violate the Consumer LegalRemedies Act, Civil Code Section 1750, et seq.   Defendants' acts warrantappropriate injunctive and declaratory relief, including an injunctionrestraining them from charging unjust and unfair rates or manipulating themarket for electricity.FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTIONUnconscionability(Against All Defendants)85. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference each and everyallegation set forth above.86. Defendants charged rates for wholesale electricity that wereunconscionable given their cost of production, the newly emergent marketsfor that product, and the consumers' need for electrical power.87. Defendants' rates were   inherently   excessive, invalid andunconscionable, particularly in light of the deceptive and manipulativepractices they used to inflate the market prices and the vital needconsumers and businesses have for electrical power./ / / 888. Defendants' unconscionable prices were passed through to Plaintiffand the majority of the Class in the retail electricity rates charged bySDG&amp;E and thereby directly damaged Plaintiff and the Class. VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEFWHEREFORE, Plaintiff and the Class pray for judgment against defendants asfollows:(a) That the Court determine that this action may be maintained as aclass action and direct that reasonable   notice of this action be given tothe members of the Class;(b) That the combination, contract, arrangement, agreement, conspiracyand trust alleged herein be adjudged and decreed to be an unreasonablerestraint of trade in violation of Sections 16720 and 16726 of theCalifornia Business and Professions Code;&amp;copy; That damages be granted according to proof, and that Plaintiff andthe Class be awarded treble damages or statutory damages, where applicable,attorneys' fees, costs and disbursements;(d) That Plaintiff and the Class be awarded pre- and post-judgmentinterest;(e) That the Court enter appropriate injunctive and other equitablerelief, including the disgorgement of defendants' unlawful profits; and(f) That Plaintiff and the Class have such other and further relief asthe Court may deem just and proper under the circumstances.Dated: November 27,   2000   KRAUSE &amp;KALFAYAN___James C.

Great Lakes then sent a notice letter forRule 111 purposes and Figa dismissed rather than allowing the Rule 111 motionto be filed.

How does it look at your end? Also, do we want a \"reasoned opinion\" or just a \"decision\" from them?   Since there are few, if any grounds for an appeal, McDade recommends a \"decision\". Ileana&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;Bonnie.White@enron.com&lt; 02/13/01 111:07AM &lt;&lt;&lt;Ileana,As of now, my calendar is clear for August 20th.   I will pencil this in,although I think we should make sure that everybody also has the 21st openin case the arbitration takes more than one day.   We will, of course, needto have Max Yzaguirre available.   Even though we are posturing the case asa summary judgment case, I think it would also be helpful to have DwightBeach and Steve Irwin available.   They would be the two best witnesses, Ithink, to discuss all of the things that McKenna had not done in order tohave a viable project.   I believe this type of testimony would be helpfulto the arbitrators so that they would know that, in ruling on the contractinterpretation as a matter of law, they are also ruling in a fundamentallyfair manner---neither the law nor equity is on McKenna's side.   If youagree, I will contact them about their availability.   I agree that weshould despose McKenna fairly quickly.   We will need to nail down what hemight say as to contacts with offtakers, etc., so that we can determine thenecessity of getting them involved.   If we do need to get them involved,perhaps we could do so by way of affidavit rather than live testimony, or,at most, by deposition.   Let me know what you think.

      "body": "\nHoward--- I strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation. When we originally hired Greenberg, we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30 minutes---5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience... Some in the group thought that they were the right choice over, for example, Andrews &amp; Kurth, because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at the courthouse than at FERC. I clearly think we made the right call in this regard. However at the time we made the choice, I made the comment, which I am sure all of you remember, that if we were going to choose litigation counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job. If that happened to be Greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview like the rest. The fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get the job. That research is transferable.This is a billion dollar issue for the group. Enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are absolutely sure they are the best there is. I have talked to the attys for both Mirant and Reliant and they agree with my position. I think we need to talk about this at length. \t\"Howard J.

If that provesto be true, as I suspect it will, the Committee should not hesitate tosupport a section 503(b) application on McCutheon Doyle's behalf at theappropriate time.With respect to your second point, one of the primary reasons discussed forthe Committee's decision to hire the Greenberg Glusker firm was the strengthof its litigation group, its experience with \"inverse condemnation cases\"and the need to move quickly to control the commandeering litigation.   TheCommittee did discuss its concerns regarding the attorneys retained by theDebtor to handle the commandeering litigation but I do not recall anyreservations or qualifications concerning Greenberg Glusker's prosecution ofthe commandeering matter.   During our Committee meetings, Greenberg Gluskerhas already reported to the Committee the substantial time and effort it isdevoting to the commandeering matter, along with the McCutcheon firm.   Ofcourse, it goes without saying in any employment application that theCommittee always reserves its right to change counsel or hire specialcounsel when appropriate.   Accordingly, I see no reason to make any changesto the Greenberg Glusker employment application to address this point.Please let me know right away if you disagree.   By copy of this email to theother Committee members, I ask that they also let me know right away if theydisagree.Thanks for responding quickly.---Original Message---From: Brian Holman [mailto:BHolman@LA.WHITECASE.COM]Sent: Thursday, April 26, 20001 5:42 PMTo: pgurfein@akingump.com; jcrossen@apx.com; rberry@apx.com;rich.stevens@avistacorp.com; david.burns@bakerbotts.com;doug.anderson@calenergy.com; dag@dgdk.com; rkd@dgdk.com;richard.b.sanders@enron.com; adefelice@ggfcmk.com; cstremmel@ggfcmk.com;ghanken@ggfcmk.com; jkrieger@ggfcmk.com; kjohan@ladwp.com;ceklund@llgm.com; dwhitley@llgm.com; jrnelson@llgm.com; mlubic@mdbe.com;zack.starbird@mirant.com; pmar@mofo.com; hweg@pgwlaw.com;david.facey@powerex.com; teresa.conway@powerex.com;rbeitler@sempratrading.com; awells@stroock.com; ayudkowsky@stroock.com;pjazayeri@stroock.comCc: mcohen@ggfcmk.comSubject: Re: Participants Committee CounselHoward:I don't believe the Committee has agreed to recommend that McCutcheon Doylebe compensated for its \"commandeering\" litigation support.

I'll look this over, but if it is just more software to catch firms sending an extra associate to a deposition I'm not interested.   I think there is an art to managing outside counsel to get the best out them, and the approaches these systems follow is usually more harmful than productive.   As a result, I am usually pretty cool to these programs.   And I am certain that there is no way Kristina or Vicki will approve any payment to someone who is making a pitch from our business, if that is in the offing.   Sorry to be such a downer on this.   Maybe Richard is interested.

The seminar would be targeted to those Enron attorneys who are litigation managers or otherwise supervise the work of outside counsel. The cost for the presentation is $5000. From talking to Mr. Salomon, I understand that his seminar is an effort to expose Enron's Legal Dept to what other companies are doing regarding managing outside counsel, and his ultimate hope is to be able to enter into an agreement to provide assistance to Enron in reducing its outside legal costs through a variety of methods, including fee arrangements, billing practices and procedures and the like. Mr. Salomon's list of clients is impressive. Would you like me to proceed with arranging the presentation? I'd be happy to discuss further.   Bob Vote\n"

(Based on a conversation with counsel this afternoon, the PX is perfectly willing to do this.)   If FERC ultimately rules against us, the PX would be able to assert a set-off that would wipe out the claim in the arbitration.

At this time we are putting together small working   groups to validate some of our assumptions and refine our initial service   offerings.Initially our design group, along with perhaps one of our   technology consultants, would like to meet with a group of Enron people for half   a day.? Ideally this group would consist of four to six people from   finance, legal, and operations so that we get good cross-functional feedback   about our services.? Before the meeting we would provide you with a brief   description of our proposed service offerings and a list of points for   discussion at the meeting.The real focus of the meeting will be on how   we should build these services to meet the needs of businesses operating in B2B   marketplaces.? We are very concerned with providing services that are   relevant to that environment.We would like to meet between November 14   and?December 1?since construction of our services is already   underway.? Please let me know what is possible, and feel free to give me a   call if you have any questions (978-376-90004).?Thanks.-&lt; GerryGerry StrathmanneCommerce GroupAmerican Arbitration   Association(978) 376-90004\n"

This had beenhandled by Jud Scheaf and had been dormant for a long time, which is whyneither I nor anyone at the company knew about it.This is somewhat confusing, so let me try to explain.   The style isKilbarger Construction vs Eastland Energy Group, et al.   In the Court ofCommon Pleas of Muskingum County, Ohio   Case No. CH96-03111.CGAS had a lease in Muskingum County.   Eastland Energy had a lease on anadjoining tract.   Eastland approached CGAS about going together to drill awell on a unit formed by the two leases.   CGAS agreed.   Eastland wasdesignated operator.   Eastland hired Kilbarger as the drilling contractor.Kilbarger drilled the well and it was dry.   Eastland thought Kilbargernegligently drilled the well, so Eastland only paid Kilbarger half thedrilling cost.   Kilbarger filed a mechanics lien and filed suit againstEastland for the other half of the drilling costs (approximately $30,000)and also joined CGAS because of the mechanics lien.   Kilbarger was notseeking any monetary recovery from CGAS, and the lien is meaningless sinceCGAS has since released its lease.   Thus, we have no pending claims fromKilbarger.However, in the same case Eastland and CGAS have a claim pending.   Duringthe drilling of the well, some of the contractors would not work forEastland since they did not know Eastland - a new, small producer.   Thosecontractors therefore did the work on the well for CGAS, billed CGAS, CGASpaid those contractors, and CGAS then invoiced Eastland.   Eastland did notpay and therefore CGAS has a claim in this suit against Eastland for$7,139.69.   No monetary claim has been made by Eastland against CGAS.I just learned of this case and have taken over this file from Jud Scheaf.There is a settlement conference scheduled for December 9 and this case isset for trial on December 16.   I am hopeful this will be resolved beforetrial.   If there are questions, please call.\n"

As we discussed, Brobeck can provide excellent&lt; commercial&lt;   litigation services to any of Enron's business units in their&lt; business and&lt;   commercial disputes, and is particularly qualified and&lt; well-positioned to&lt;   provide litigation services to Enron Broadband.   As we&lt; discussed, I'd like&lt;   to come back to Houston with one of my senior partners to meet&lt; or have lunch&lt;   with the litigation managers for your other business units.&lt;&lt;   By way of   background, Brobeck is based in San Francisco and&lt; established the&lt;   Austin office in 19994 primarily to service the expanding&lt; technology centers&lt;   here.   Our Austin office is a full-service office, providing&lt; services in&lt;   complex commercial litigation, intellectual property litigation,&lt; securities&lt;   litigation, labor and employment, and corporate.   I am a member&lt; of the&lt;   complex commercial group where we handle high stakes and high&lt; profile&lt;   business and commercial disputes in every major industry, from&lt; Fortune 5000&lt;   companies to emerging-growth businesses.   We also serve as&lt; national counsel&lt;   in defending clients in major class action suits.&lt;&lt;   In 19996, Brobeck began to grow its litigation presence in Texas&lt; by hiring&lt;   litigators from the Houston and Dallas markets who had&lt; excellent&lt;   reputations as trial lawyers, and who had excellent&lt; relationships with the&lt;   judiciary and the local bar associations. We have put together a&lt; group of 20&lt;   commercial litigators(5 partners, 15 associates) who have tried&lt; cases in all&lt;   parts of Texas and who have extensive relationships with judges&lt; all over the&lt;   state.   We are hired to handle cases all over the state.&lt;&lt;   Please let me know if you need additional information on me or&lt; the firm.   I&lt;   look forward to hearing from you to set up lunch or a meeting in&lt; your office&lt;   to meet the litigation managers from Enron's respective business&lt; units.&lt;   Thank you again for your time...Jarvis&lt;&lt;   Jarvis V.

Do I need to?\tBarton Clark\t09/07/2000 09:19 PM \t\t\t To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Arbitration ProvisionIn a development agreement for a power plant in Connecticut, I have included what I believe to be our standard ENA arbitration/damages limitation provision, that contains a provision stating that ENA and counterparty shall each designate an arbitrator, \" who need not be neutral\", within 30 days after receiving notification of the filing for the demand for arbitration. The originators on the transaction are adamantly opposed to the quoted language because it is \"not standard\" ENA arbitration language, is an affront to our counterparty, and \"could screw up the transaction\" if I insist leaving it in the document. I have pointed out it is applicable to our and our counterparty's designee, and is intended to ensure we get at least one sympathetic or at least knowledgeable participant on the panel that could be persuasive to the panel as a whole. I also said I thought the deletion of the quoted language would give the counterparty the right to challenge a \"non-neutral\" designee under the rules of the AA and throw the whole designation process up in the air ( I'm not sure that is right). Given the strident objections, do you think we materially prejudice our rights by removal of the quoted language, and if so, can you give me some greater ammunition to use with my originators? Thanks for your assistance.\n"

Andthere are cheaper ones...that you can buy at Sam's or other warehouses andput up yourself...However, I picked out two that could go with our fort and sandbox out thereand really provide the swinging and climbing part of the playscape.   It wasaffordable and they come out and set it up.I would like to order soon.   They can have it too the Perd in about threeweeks.   So, please tell me what you think.The simpler one is about 2220 per family, and the bigger one is about 280 perfamily.Talk to you soon.\n"

We'd rather United India remain the claimant because we think they will have a difficult time carrying their burden. We are fighting this issue in the first hearing to be held before the arbitrators in London on Feb.15.   One of the bases on which United India relies, albeit weak, is that it commenced arbitration to avoid a suit in Texas courts, and that in consulting Texas lawyers, they learned \"coincidentally\" that these lawyers were \"defending 3 sets of   bad faith proceedings brought by Enron in the face of binding arbitration agreements.\"   That was in November   2000.   I've called everyone I think would know, and as far as I can tell,   this is not true.   We are about to file an affidavit stating so in the case.   Please confirm (again if I have already contacted you) that you know of no bad faith claims of any kind   (not necessarily just in the insurance context) brought by Enron against anyone that is currently pending or was pending at that time.   We do not know who the lawyers they claimed to have consulted were.   Please advise me if there is someone else I should ask.Thanks for your help!Kind regards,Michelle\n"

Henri, Director of Utility Electric PortfolioManagement at Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&amp;E). Mr. Henri stated thatPG&amp;E was providing notice pursuant to Sections 15.1 and 15.2 of the ISOTariff that \"Uncontrollable Forces prevent PG&amp;E from performing all of itsobligations under the ISO Tariff.\"   Mr. Henri's letter identified\"government regulations and market conditions\" as \"forces beyond PG&amp;E'sreasonable control.\"   In addition, Mr. Henri stated that the temporaryelectric rate increase ordered by the California Public Utilities Commissionon January 4, 20001 was \"an amount far below that necessary to enable PG&amp;E togenerate sufficient cash to pay its ongoing procurement bills.\"   Mr. Henri continued by stating that \"PG&amp;E...lacks the fundsto pay in full its bill from the Independent System Operator for Novemberpower purchases, due on February 1, 20001.\"   Further, Mr. Henri stated that\"because PG&amp;E's inability to make full payment is due to UncontrollableForces, the ISO Tariff precludes the Independent Service (sic.) Operatorfrom imposing any sanctions against PG&amp;E.\"   Mr. Henri concluded by stating that PG&amp;E's efforts to securerelief from these circumstances continue and that PG&amp;E will inform the ISOas soon as it is able to resume making full payment for its wholesale powerpurchases.   At present, the California ISO neither accepts nor rejectsthe claims made in Mr. Henri's letter.

This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final figure at an estimated $1555-160 million.   We expect to be invoiced for the principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take as long as 60 days.   The written opinion reflects a determination on the part of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.   The opinion seeks to conclude \"what rational businessmen could have intended\" rather than applying the provisions of the contract.   For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that the   \"retrospective consequences\" of discovering a latent defect after payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacceptable.   His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.   Furthermore, he says that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.   The contract makes no reference to this requirement.   Hoffman's view is that it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the restitution issue.   As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point at the commencement of the hearing.   Reimbursement of these costs should have been a given. Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our other counsel have assessed the opinion as \"appalling\" and \"pathetic,\" and describe the situation as one where Enron has been \"stitched up\".   Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse.In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from each of you for these past six years.   The case has been a roller coaster ride;   I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if you wish to have a copy of the opinion.   My telephone number is 0111 444 207 783 6582.   Many thanks.\n"

They suggested that they would be happy to send us a letter indemnifying us if it would allow EIP to sit down and walk through the issues that killed the deal.I would like to be able to sit down with them to walk through these issues since EIP, as an organization, has been working with the company for almost a year.

The ISO has not distributed that money to creditors because of the Enron v. CalPX suit.   As documented in an earlier e-mail, Chris Stokley, Murray O'Neill, and I called the ISO's treasurer and explained that the judge's order expressly excluded payments to the CAISO from the PX's general right not to pay creditors.The ISO now informs us that the CalPX plans to have PG&amp;E's payment transferred to the PX into an escrow account.   I copied the key part of the ISO's document below, and the full document is attached.\"Additionally, the ISO received $171,1116,1114.43 ($1777 million less GMC obligation) directly from PG&amp;E.   PG&amp;E indicated the funds were to be applied in payment of California Power Exchange (\"Cal PX\") obligations.   The ISO has been contacted by the Cal PX, and they have indicated they believe they are entitled to such funds and that such funds are subject to a pending action in federal court entitled \"Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Corp. v. California Power Exchange Corporation\", Case No. 01-000901CM (Central District of   California.   The Cal PX has indicated they plan to seek an order within the next 7-10 days with the Court to have the funds transferred to the Cal PX for deposit into an escrow account pursuant to Judge Moreno's Preliminary Injunction.   These funds are being held by the ISO in a segregated interest bearing account pending resolution of this issue by that court.\"I think we all would agree that the money belongs to ISO creditors, and that the PX has no claim on these funds.   My guess is that the PX would like to have this money so that it can deduct administrative expenses from it.   If I can provide more information on this, let me know.Steve---"

Gray Davis earmarked $4 million of state funds so Lockyer's office caninvestigate claims of collusion, profiteering, price gouging and otheranticompetitive behavior on the part of generators.Generators such as Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Duke Energy (DUK) havevehemently denied the claims, saying their behavior in the wholesale electricitymarket has already been investigated by federal regulators and various stateagencies, all of whom have concluded that the companies did not violate anyantitrust laws.Recently, however, the California Independent System Operator, manager of thestate's electricity grid, concluded a study that found the same companiesovercharged California $6 billion for electricity during part of 2000 and early20001.Generators said the high prices are due to an imbalance in supply and demand inthe state and the high price of natural gas.The ISO has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order generatorsto refund the money to the state's utilities. FERC agreed, but gave generatorsthe benefit of the doubt and asked the companies to substantiate theirelectricity prices or refund the money.Lockyer, whose investigation has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, according to aspokeswoman in his office, is now seeking a whistleblower.\"Anyone who provides information leading to the successful prosecution of afalse claim action may be entitled to percentage share in the award,\" Lockyersaid. \"Since billions of dollars may be recovered, the award to an informantcould potentially range from $50 million to the hundreds of millions of dollars.\"Davis has frequently referred to out-of-state generators as \"greedy profiteers\"and one Sacramento lawmaker has introduced legislation that would place awindfall profits tax on sales of electricity generators earn in the state'swholesale market.Lockyer said the state should not be left holding the bag for \"greedy businessdecisions of generators, marketers and utilities\" adding that he will seekcriminal and civil penalties if his investigation finds that generators gougedthe wholesale electricity market.\"Justice requires that those who have reaped unconscionable profits at theexpense of California pay back what they owe.\"-By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 310-666-99986; jason.leopold@dowjones.com20001 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.

Although this amount is not huge by Enron standards, in this case any further funding has no chance of recovery and would be an immediate writeoff.   As you know, this \"project\" has had extremely high visibility.   We need to leave no stone unturned!   Thanks.   Dick.John Enerson@ECT02/14/20001 02:16 PMTo: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Richard Lydecker/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: Can Fibre LackawannaI have received notice from Can Fibre Lackawanna that there are in default under the payment obligation under the Subordinated Loan Agreement.   The Subordination provisions state that until the Senior Debt is paid off in full, the Subordinated Lenders (thats us) can not accelerate, foreclose, etc.   There is not 180 day period.   There is nothing.   Nonetheless, this does highlight the need to get these documents reviewed by counsel and start to weigh our options and strategy.   This is specially true for matters with respect to the Construction Completion and the additional $4.5 million that remains unfunded.   The letter of credit backing the $4.5 million obligation expires on June 30, 20001.   At that time we have an argument that we will not replace the letter of credit and because they are in default, we are not going to fund.I think we should start having outside counsel get up to speed on this now.   Can Fibre knows we do not want to fund and so it is better to be prepared.   An analysis would include.1.   Review of the applicable conditions to fund the $4.5 million and make sure that all steps are taking to hold them to the letter of the agreement.   In particular, since they tests are under the terminated EPC contract, we want to make certain that no rights have been waived.   Also, we want to put them on notice that they have to follow everything to the letter and we need to develop any strategy or experts to contest any certifications.2.   Review the documents to see if there is any wiggle room based on the current default.3.   Understand our obligations.   The loan agreement requires us to fund $4.5 million upon completion (regardless of the posting of the letter of credit).   By being in default, does that provide us a defense to funding.   Can they cure the default and make us fund.   What does bankruptcy do to this scenario.Let me know your thoughts and who we can talk to regarding these issues.\n"

A $9000,000 claim reduced to $ 150,000 is a serious issue .From what I can gather from Ted Rosen's note is that   Baytank appear to admit to some form of liability/responsibility on the off spec which   I suppose is some progress.I'm copying Graham on this now because he has plenty of experience in Europe with these claims .This must be   sorted out and treated as high priority.Call me to discussThanksStuartSteven M Elliott17/07/2000 222:28To: \"Ted Rosen\" &lt;trosen@jwortham.com&lt; @ ENRONcc: Lisa Walker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stuart Bland/lon/ect Subject: Re: Cargo/Storage Claim - Styrene at Baytank   I guess that we all expected such a reply from the Insurance company.   Apparently we need to have a meeting to discuss the letter that I just received because I am very curious where all these numbers and information have come from.1) What does a contract with Enron and   Philchem have to do with a cargo claim?   The product in the tank was owned by Enron and only Enron.   2) On November 5th we discovered that the product was off-spec.   The beginning inventory that day was approx. 6.6mm pounds.   Where does 2mm pounds come from?3) Baytank would not admit to a problem with the tank in which Enron is bound by contract.   Enron, under contract, is still obligated to pay costs assoiated with the tank.   In order for the tank to be used, it must be cleaned since it is considered off-spec.   Enron had nothing to do with the tank going off-spec and should be compensated for any and all out of costs and expenses incurred while the tank was considered off-spec.   4) The tank agreement stipulates that a minimum of 3,104 mtons will be paid every month for thru-put no matter how much volume goes thru the tank.   Again, Enron is bound by a contract and is still responsible for these costs until Baytank is proven at fault.Steve Elliott\n"

Thus, if its not too late already, it is imperative that we file our answer to the PX's answer ASAP.   In this regard, no party filed a reply yesterday in opposition to the PX's motion to the bankruptcy court to lift the automatic stay.   It is my understanding that a proposed order is circulating among applicable bankruptcy counsel.   If all counsel sign today, the PX intends to file it with the court tomorrow and we could conceivably get an order from the court tomorrow modifying the stay.I am advised, however, that if not all counsel are available to sign the proposed order today, the PX intends to simply file the proposed order with the court tomorrow.   In this event, under local rules, the court must wait seven days before entering an order modifying the stay.   Of course, this will be after FERC's meeting next week.Assuming that an order is not issued tomorrow, the question for the group is whether we should file our answer tomorrow in any event.   The theory would be that since the debtor itself sought to modify the stay so as to permit litigation of the chargeback proceeding to continue, no party opposed the motion, and the debtor filed a proposed order with the court to modify the stay, any violation of the automatic stay would be technical at best, and unlikely to be raised by the PX in the bankruptcy proceeding.   (This argument would be enhanced if the PX requests the court, when it eventually enters its order, to do so retroactively to April 6).I would like to hear from the parties (including bankruptcy counsel) whether they endorse or oppose this approach.   Thanks.   RonP.S.   if you are aware of any members of our group that have been left off this email, please let me know.\n"

Twanda will call you to set it up.\tKenton Erwin@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS\t05/16/2000 07:26 PM \t\t\t To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Citgo pipeline claimRichard, my larger projects are peaking right now, and Kristina suggested that I ask you whether you would like to manage this matter.   A Citgo gasoline pipeline was ruptured by our subcontractor (Wilde Construction) last May, near Luling TX.   Citgo has incurred aprox. $7000k of cleanup costs.   We believe the costs should be shared by Citgo (for failing to correctly mark the line), Wilde (for negligently striking the line), and Bechtel ( for not being present as our construction manager, knowing that Wilde was working near the gasoline line).   The new complication:   The spill may prevent the proposed buyer from purchasing the 1000-odd acres parcel affected by the spill.   If that purchase doesn't go through, the attorney for the Mexican national landowner told me that the mortgage on the land would be foreclosed, and the landowner would bring an action for the lost purchase price ($1.3MM) (which I doubt he could fully recover, since he could sell the property for some lesser amount).I am setting up a mediation (of Citgo, Bechtel, and Wilde), where John Odam (our atty, with Mangham Hardy) would act as mediator.   The new info about the land claim may change that strategy.Would you like to manage this, or be somewhat involved, or not involved?Thanks,Kenton\n"

Consent Issue:   Jose Bestard (he's the main developer who did this deal) reported that he met with Furnas this week.   Furnas had not received   EPE's letter addressing the consent issue.   Furnas continues to link its failure to sign the consent to commercial exposure to the high price from the MAE. There are initials on the original consent and no one (including Furnas) knows whose they are. John Novak told me he's not sure of the significance, but it is not uncommon in Brazil to initial documents. Nevertheless, we need to ask our Brazilian lawyers whether there is any significance under Brazilian law.   Keep in mind also that consent document was between EPE and the assignor, Electronorte. 2.   Arbitration considerations:   Bestard has a meeting planned with the ambassador.   He   consulted Enron's financial/business consultant in Brazil, Winston Fernino (sp?) who advised that we should exhaust all political avenues before resorting to litigation or arbitration.   What concerns me, however, is   his advice that, politically, it is not the time to seek assistance fromthe president for the consent, that there is a political battle in the senate, and that we should wait until the end of February to seek political assistance.   My view on that is, to wait 4 more weeks to progress with this notice of default, when the 90 day cure period has expired, plus the 30 day extension which has also expired, sends the wrong message and weakens our position. Thus, it is my recommendation that we proceed immediately with a notice to terminate under Clause 27, paragraph 2 of the PPA, which then requires a 30day consultation period (paragraph3) at the end of which we have the option to terminate.   This buys us a little time, but keeps the pressure on, at the end of which we can initiate proceedings to compel the consent or to terminate.   I'm not sure what reaction the notice to terminate could bring about from Furnas. I'm not sure how that plays out in our settlement with Siemans. Consider also that the commercial people are not comfortable with termination yet.   I am not sure what rights, if any, we waive by waiting around doing nothing or how that may affect our position in arbitration or litigation (something we need to look at under the contract, although I cannot immediately recall any deadlines or express waivers related to timing in this regard).   I committed that we would advise the team on the next call (next Thursday) our recommendation with respect to   arbitration/litigation.   I want to make sure they understand every possibility so they can make an informed decision. You have the matrix developed already if you want to expand on that, or handle that your own way.   Bestard opines that Furnas will fight hard, that they have traditionally been very adversarial and uncooperative. I'll find out who represents them. 3. Force Majeure:   Furnas is also taking a very strong position that EPE does not have a valid force majeure claim.   Based on my reading of the contract, our facts appear to fit squarely under Clause 95&amp;copy;.   However, I'm told we did not comply strictly to the notice terms. We'll need to show that we were not negligent as a cause for the attorney general's action.   Laine Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position.   Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both parties have the right to terminate.   No one buys the plant and we're stuck.   I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.   There have been several.4.   Budget:   Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,   what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.   We may want to consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it.   I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.   It needs to be subject to review as we go along.5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice.   We certainly have some conflicting views.   Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway.   If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.   Who knows.Please give me your comments or just call me.   I'm open to any suggestions. John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan.Regards,Michelle\n"

Laine Powell, President of the Cuiaba companies will gather the information on our force majeure claim and we need to consider the legal issues related to our position.   Note that if FM lasts more than 12 consecutive months, both parties have the right to terminate.   No one buys the plant and we're stuck.   I'll find out the date of our last FM notice.   There have been several.4.   Budget:   Lets consider what it will cost to nail down this arbitration concern and give initial advice on how to proceed over the next week,   what it will cost to prepare for arbitration and, the cost of the arbitration. Darren I'll call you tomorrow and we can break that out.   We may want to consider the litigation route. We'll need to put together some kind of proposed or potential time line, and what will happen in each stage and tie a number to it.   I've done this with Pete before and he seems to like it.   It needs to be subject to review as we go along.5.NEXT: Prep for the call and get a recommended strategy in place. I'm going to get together all our opinions on the Brazilian state of arbitration and get a conference call with one of these experts so we can get the best advice.   We certainly have some conflicting views.   Our experience in the Brazilian courts is that nothing happens and we could be stuck for years, so I am inclined to take our chances with arbitration and we may get stuck in the court anyway.   If we go to court, perhaps Furnas would take the position that we must arbitrate, that is what Fernando Serec said.   Who knows.Please give me your comments or just call me.   I'm open to any suggestions. John Novak will be able to tell us about all the competing concerns that I may be unaware of with any strategic plan.Regards,Michelle\n"

EOTT is not a party to any of the contracts involving the \"sample leases\" that are referenced in the subpoena, and the subpoena does not appear to be directed to the types of business that are conducted by EOTT.   As indicated in memos from Charles Tetrault,   the document requests are focused on EOG and ECT.   EOTT is not going to pay 25% of the legal fees associated with EOG's and ECT's response to this subpoena.I do not have a problem with paying 25% of this first bill ($1,250.79), because it was worth $1,250.79 to learn that EOTT probably will not have to provide any documents that are responsive to this subpoena.   However, until someone can convince me that the DOJ is actually interested in some EOTT transactions, I will not advise EOTT to contribute more than 5% to this effort in the future.   If we cannot agree on an allocation to EOTT that is less than 5%, then EOTT will need to make separate arrangements with respect to the minimal representation that it will apparently require with respect to this matter.Of course, should circumstances change such that EOTT becomes a focus of this investigation, then we would be willing to pay a greater share of these legal fees.   Currently, however, EOTT transactions do not appear to be of interest to the DOJ, and EOTT should not be allocated 25% of the legal fees associated with responses by other Enron affiliates to this subpoena.Please call me next week so that we may discuss EOTT's participation in this matter.Britt Davis@ENRON06/09/999 10:09 AMTo: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Walt Zimmerman/Houston/Eott@Eott, Steve Williams/EOG/Enron@Enron, Bonnie White/Corp/Enron@Enron, Robert Vote/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Michael Moran/ET&amp;S/Enron@Enron, Brenda McAfee/Corp/Enron@Enron, Shirley Davey/Corp/Enron@Enron Subject: DOJ Royalty Inquiry I have received a copy of a V&amp;E invoice regarding the above-referenced case in the total amount of $5,0003.17, which is split equally among Enron Corp., EOG, ECT, and EOTT, pursuant to the agreement of those parties.

MSEB is now approx. 45 days late on payment in full of the October invoice.   They have paid only a relatively modest portion of that bill.   Payment on the November bill is about 15 days late.   The MSEB Chairman says that MSEB can't pay these invoices.At present, the Governments of Maharashtra and India are refusing to engage in a constructive dialogue on solving the non-payment issue and the 14000 MW that will come on line as part of Phase II.   They say that they recognize their obligations as guarantors of MSEB's obligations but are not interested in helping in any different capacity (e.g., GOI buys some or all of Phase II).Until just a few days ago, the lead India bank was refusing to fund even their own ongoing interest obligation.   At present, they are refusing to continue funding any other Phase II draw request.   The India banks have a great deal to lose and, in our opinion, should strongly consider continuing to fund Phase II.   It would seem that the lead India bank is scared, knaive or, worse yet, very pessimistic about Dabhol's future --- perhaps there are other reasons for their current position.We are meeting with the international banks in NY on Tuesday.   Our main goal is to convince them to continue to fund and to use their influence to have the India banks do the same.The current India legal crisis team is nearly identical to the 19995 India legal crisis team.   The same law firms and lawyers (both Indian and international) are continuing to play much the same roles.We have not identified any particular \"holes\" in Dabhol's legal position.   While the India newspapers have offered up various theories that might allow MSEB to cancel the PPA (frustration of purpose, etc.), none seem compelling.   No counterparty has offered up any of these theories directly to DPC.In the short term, we are preparing (1) a demand under the GOM guarantee and (2) a \"meet and discuss\" letter under the PPA.   The current plan is to serve these next week.   We are also preparing (3) an arbitration notice under the GOM guarantee, (4) a demand under the GOI guarantee and (5) an action against MERC.   MERC is the Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission.   They have issued \"orders\" over the last year limiting the amount of power that MESB buys from Dabhol.   We do not believe that they have jurisdiction to do so.   We may or may not ultimately file this action.Let me know if I can provide any further information.Bruce\n"

The company's open position at any one time will be no more than $5000,000.   Jeff Hodge and Francisco Pinto-Leite have been working   on the trading contracts.   Our businesspeople inform us that they will not be able to obtain counterparties' agreement to international arbitration.   We, for our part, are unwilling to agree to refer all disputes to the Colombia courts.   The best option appears to be arbitration conducted under the auspices of the Bogota Chamber of Commerce.   We have obtained a written opinion from local counsel, Figueroa Sierra &amp; Asociados, opining that this body has a proven record of conducting arbitrations fairly, without bias, and free from corruption.   In particular, foreign parties have been treated without discrimination, winning their fair share of awards.   We are requesting that we be permitted to accept the Bogota Chamber of Commerce as the exclusive forum for resolving any disputes that might arise under our trading contracts.   I am aware that we have accepted local arbitration for trading disputes in Buenos Aries; I am not sure whether we have done so in Europe.Please let me know if this is acceptable to you, or if would like additional information.

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hardcopies are made or needed for running our business.   Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice.   If space becomes a problem, please contact___ who can arrange for storage.2. What constitutes a document?   In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean.   For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved.   Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document.   On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used.   If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well.   Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents.   Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hardcopies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesaleelectricity market litigation.   If hard copy documents are discarded, at alater point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failingto preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages fromfriends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policyand you may do with them as you wish.Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.ThanksGary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

It's a WORD feature that is used --- a lot --- for redlining drafts.   I see it used all the time on documents that I receive from 3rd parties and I use it myself.   It has become popular because other tools, like CompareWrite and similar software, are not compatible w/ more recent versions of WordPerfect and WORD, so changes are often missed in marked drafts.   I learned during a recent visit at my old law firm that that they've forbidden use of \"Track Changes\" and are advising their clients to do the same b/c the past changes never go away and can be retrieved forever by someone who knows anything about word processing technology.   Which makes for interesting results in document discovery... among other things.   Just thought I'd pass this along.

Here is the current status as we&lt; understand it.   Based upon the agreements we reached between October 6,&lt; 2000 and October 18, 2000 (date of your confirming email) the Enron&lt; Entities have made the following document productions in response to the&lt; subpoenas served by California Public Utilities Commission (the&lt; \"Commission\"):&lt;&lt; * October 13, 2000   Bate Nos. Enron Entities 0001-00025 on behalf&lt; of all Enron Entities Responsive to Request Nos. 1-111, 20.&lt;&lt; * October 27, 2000 Bate Nos. P0001-00021115 on behalf of Portland&lt; General Responsive to Request Nos. 12, 14, 16 and 18.&lt;&lt; * November 14, 2000 Bate No. Enron Entities 00026 (Diskette with&lt; EES/EEEMC retail data) Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13, 15 to 17,&lt; and 19.&lt;&lt; * November 15, 2000 Bate No. P00021116-00021117 (Diskettes with Portland&lt; General Data, which include approximate 3555,000 wholesale transactions)&lt; Responsive to Request Nos. 7 to 111, 13 to 17, and 19.&lt;&lt; We believe with these productions, we have complied with the October&lt; 6-18th agreement with respect to Portland General and EES/EEEMC.   As you&lt; know, these productions were all made reserving the Enron Entities rights&lt; to object or challenge the subpoenas and reserving any claims, defenses,&lt; objections, jurisdictional or otherwise, or other responses.&lt;&lt;   We originally had hoped to have all of the Transactional Data for&lt; EPMI, as defined in our October 6th email, available for production by&lt; October 27th.   However, we were also mindful of your expressed expectation&lt; that any data provided be useful and reliable.   The collection of data you&lt; requested in the subpoenas is neither kept electronically in the same&lt; location nor organized as you requested it.   In fact during our review of&lt; some of the data we found significant errors that called into question the&lt; methodology by which the data was extracted from existing information.&lt; When it became apparent that we could not accurately estimate how long it&lt; would take to get reliable data given the volume of transactions involved,&lt; we informed you of the problem.   We now understand that if we cannot give&lt; you a firm date when the balance of the Transactional Data will be&lt; available, the Commission believes it will have no choice but to seek to&lt; compel production before the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission&lt; (\"FERC\").   We understand the pressure that you must be under to get data&lt; immediately, but we cannot, at this time, give you another date in the&lt; immediate future by which we are certain that we will be able to produce&lt; accurate data.&lt;&lt;   Moreover, during the iterim between October 18th and today, a number&lt; of significant events have occurred that we believe bear on the subpoenas&lt; served on the Enron entities.   First, we understand that many other&lt; parties who were served with the same subpoenas have not provided the&lt; detailed information requested and have objected on a variety of very&lt; sound legal grounds.   Second, the Commission itself has, without a hearing&lt; on the motion, unilaterally revised the proposed protective order that is&lt; supposed to govern these productions and summarily denied other changes&lt; sought by other parties served.   Third, the Commission has filed its&lt; motion before FERC seeking an order compelling the production of the data&lt; from those other parties that have objected and seeking an expedited&lt; hearing and production schedule.   We note that the reasons stated in the&lt; motion before FERC as the basis for the production are materially&lt; different than the reasons originally stated in the ex parte application&lt; to the Commission's own Administrative Law Judge who issued the subpoenas.&lt; Finally, FERC itself has completed its investigation and has issued a&lt; tentative order as of November 1, 2000.&lt;&lt;   Originally, the Enron Entities had been prepared to accept \"most&lt; favored nation\" treatment with respect to protective orders and requests&lt; by others to limit the scope of the subpoenas and produce information that&lt; was available.   However, given both the Commission's stated urgent need&lt; for an immediate answer that EPMI cannot in good faith give despite&lt; substantial effort (date for production of reliable and accurate&lt; Transaction Data) and the uncertainty created by the above described&lt; intervening events, EPMI believes it has no choice but to serve its formal&lt; objections and responses to the subpoenas and await the Commission's&lt; threatened motion to compel before FERC.&lt;&lt;   We also understand from our discussions with you that the Commission&lt; has created various lists or categories for the entities that have been&lt; served with subpoenas.   We understand that there is a list for those&lt; entities that have been cooperating, a list for those who have been&lt; delaying and a list for those who have been objecting and exercising their&lt; rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We understand that the Commission&lt; intends to punish, by whatever means it has available, those entities that&lt; object and exercise their rights to challenge the subpoenas.   We deplore&lt; these tactics, but despite all of the efforts to cooperate described&lt; above, we understand that EPMI may in fact be moved from the cooperating&lt; list to the group to be punished for exercising its rights.&lt;&lt;   If you have and questions or comments, please do not hesitate to&lt; contact me.&lt;&lt;   Sincerely,&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   Gary S.&lt; Fergus===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

TriadAndy,This is basically a collection action for about $1,8000,000 of unpaid spot gas sales against Triad, a very small company whose address (or at least one address) is in Columbus, Maryland.   The unpaid sales deals began around February of 2000.   All the deals were made over the phone by the trader, and then confirmed with ENA's spot gas sales forms (\"confirms\").   Per ENA's usual custom and practice, neither ENA nor Triad signed the confirms, although there are signature lines.   ENA scheduled the gas due for all of these deals.   Triad paid off some other deals, but has since stopped sending us any money.   I am told that the deals that are unpaid began in late February 2000.   Triad's principal, Sherwood Purnell, has apparently admitted in a recorded telephone conference that he would pay us.   Our information is that Triad is financially unable to pay us or anyone else.Per the mandatory arbitration language in the confirms, we have sent an arbitration demand to Triad.   Triad did not respond.   The AA has sent out a list of arbitrators from which the parties are to make selections by February 7.   I have called a telephone number which gives a recording for Triad and an extension for Purnell, and left a message that I want to discuss the case.   This was on Monday.   I have also had   Becky, my legal assistant, call up Triad's registered agent for service of process, although the Maryland secretary of state's office shows that Triad is no longer in good standing.   The person whose name is listed as the registered agent answered and told Becky (a) he was still the right party to receive service of process and (b) he was \"aware of us\".   This leads me to believe that the address that we have been using is a good address.   We did get someone to sign for documents that we sent to that address.   What I don't want to do, however,   is go all the way through arbitration, get a default judgment, then, when we try to enforce it, have Triad complain that we sent the demand and the pleadings to the wrong address.My plan is to ask the AA for a fifteen-day extension of time within which to send our demand and other relevant pleadings to the registered agent and any other address that looks viable, by Federal Express or certified mail, so that we get a receipt.   So long as we get the registered agent to sign for these things, I feel a lot more comfortable about proceeding.   Giving Triad an extension of time to answer also makes us look good. Parenthetically, unfortunately, given Triad's attitude, I think it likely that after we get an arbitration award, Triad will choose not to abide by it until, at a minimum, we file a lawsuit in Maryland to have the award enforced.   I don't see a way around that problem.Let me know if it is okay to ask for the extension of time.BrittThanks.Britt\n"

      "body": "\nThe policy is to delete all e-mails after 30 days, unless they are stored in a folder. E-mails stored in a folder are erased after one year. The policy has many benefits. First it clears up computer storage space.The policy can   also results in signifigant cost savings in litigation where a Judge has required the wholesale production of   e-mails. Imagine if we were required to sift through and digest 12-24 months of e-mail traffic. This has happened to a number of companies in litigation   the US( who have subsequently changed their retention policies). Frankly, the Microsoft   antitrust case opened a lot of eyes to the dangers of not having a policy. In that case, the discovery by the Dept of Justice produced some very damaging e-mails that were later used to effectively cross-examine Bill Gates and others. It is unbelievable   what some people will put in an e-mail that they would never dream of putting in a \"written\"   document.As for your comment about the subsequent retrieval of deleted e-mails, I (and Bob) have been told many times that a deleted e-mail cannot be retrieved. Please check with your source. I am happy to discuss any questions you have about the policy.\n"

Given the size of our office, etc. I can suggest some people that would be appropriate in lieu of an MD.   Insofar as who should be present, we are suggesting that the IT person be present to run the playback, together with myself and the person who authorized the playback.On the retention policy, the policy presently applicable is fine for most of our personnel.   One of our companies, Enron Trading Services Inc. is regulated by the CFTC and the NFA, who impose a 5 year records keeping requirement.   We can purchase a separate system for the traders in that company for a cost of about $20,000.   Please let me know when you will have a moment to discuss.Thanks,Limor520 Madison AvenueNew York, NY 1000222Tel: 212-715-5283Fax: 212-715-5608Email: Limor.Nissan@Enron.com\n"

As I had indicated, Rob Milnthorp has requested that the following two Enron Canada positions have authority to approve the listening of voice recordings in the Calgary office, on behalf of Enron Canada Corp.:Chief Executive OfficerHead of TradingRob's preference is not to specify particular persons but to identify the titles instead.Can you let me know how you would like to address this issue.   I would think it is merely a matter of adding these two positions to the schedule identifying who has authority to approve the listening of the tapes.   The only problem is that the \"Managing Director\" wording could conflict with the title identification that Rob wants to use for Enron Canada.   Perhaps in that schedule, we could add a separate heading for Enron Canada.ThanksGreg\n"

The overall policy which seems to be now agreed to for European emails appears below.   INBOX- Deletion after 30 daysSENT deleted after 30 days- ( now confirmed that once in folder, it will not be deleted s.t comments below)TRASH- 15 days( same as policy )FOLDERS- moved to archives/ livelink via OUTLOOK after 365 days after being in folderARCHIVES 6 years (livelink or Ivault)However while the above time limits have been 'agreed', IT have also been developing project OMNI which as I understand it will replace Lotus Notes with Outlook.   The implementation of Outlook, involves limiting the amount of email stored ( both in your inbox and the folders) to 1000Mb before it is removed from the folder or inbox and over into an archiving system (hopefully). This technical limitation (1000Mb) may or may not clash with the day limitations we have proposed above, depending on the amount of emails one receives and the type of attachments which are in the emails themselves. The ultimate interaction between the technical parameters (1000Mb) together with the time limitations (number of days) will have to be worked out. With respect to the issue of recycling and back up tapes, once we have a reliable archive system in place we can move to eliminate the back up tapes for received emails and recycle them in a similar fashion to Houston. However it should be noted that whatever archive system we decide to use, whether it be livelink, Ivault or some other system, we will also have some sort of back up system for the archive whether it be tapes or through some other type of mechanism.I have spoken with a few of the IT people on our end and we will be having meetings to ensure that we are all of the same mind when it comes to the implementation of this policy. Hopefully this addresses a few of the concerns which were expressed. If anyone has any further comments, concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch with me at 0207 783 4084.Kind Regards,Ian Brungs   \n"

It is stillmissing a section in response to Question 2 that Mary is drafting.   Ibelieve that Ron has minimized the concerns that I had from the prior draft.He is also swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diegolitigation.   In response to Question No. 4, he is asking FERC tospecifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summersmarket, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determinethat sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.Anything less will chill the market for further investment and exacerbatethe problem.   There is some risk if we ask for this finding and do not getit, that fact will diminish arguments we might have in state or federalcourt that there has been preemption.   As a practical matter, however, ourpreliminary research has shown that without a very specific intent topreempt anti-trust laws, for example, the preemption argument may bedifficult to make anyway.   Ron and Mary clearly believe this is the onechance we have to get FERC to make a finding.   If FERC does make thefinding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.   I do not know how to assess thelikelihood that FERC will make the requested finding, and if they do whetherit will be upheld on appeal so it is difficult for me to do a risk benefitanalysis. If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditionalphrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:   \"if they were not inviolation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs.\" Talk to you tomorrow.ThanksGary---Original Message---From: Nancy Pickover [mailto:npickover@bracepatt.com]Sent: Thursday, November 30, 2000 4:26 PMTo: Jeffrey Watkiss; gfergus@brobeck.com; acomnes@enron.com;jhartso@enron.com; jsteffe@enron.com; mary.hain@enron.com;smara@enron.comSubject: Draft Responses to Chairman Hoecker's QuestionsAs you will see, the attached draft incorporates Sue's and Mary's drafts aswell as additional text from me.   The comments filed on Nov. 222 areliterally one foot high. If the Commission is serious about getting an orderout by mid-December, it is thus highly unlikely that it will carefullyreview any of the Comments other than the major players (CPUC, Gov. Davis,the UDCs).   I do believe, however, that Chairman Hoecker, the Commissionersand the high level Staffers will be more likely to review the responses toHoecker's questions.   Thus, if we are to have any realistic hope that theywill focus on our arguments, I thought it advisable to use these responsesas an advocacy piece rather than a mere discovery response.   Hence, Isuggest a lengthy rather than minimalist response.I thought that Gary's concern in an earlier email about Alan's rebuttal tothe J&amp;K piece was well taken.   I have thus taken out all references to aneed to do more analysis on the market abuse issue, and recast his write-upas simply a rebuttal of the J&amp;K Study.Finally, the draft (which I have included in Word and WP formats/ the WPformat may paginate more accurately) is no doubt in need of wordsmithing;any suggestions would be well appreciated.I would like to file this tomorrow, so please call or email me as early inthe morning as possible.

We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.1. Corporacion Nacional del   Cobre de Chile (\"Codelco\" )   v.   MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCCThis is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter &amp; May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal.Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 20001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public. - LT0108100084_3.doc2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National CorporationClaim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde &amp; Co.3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing HouseClaim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant.

Thank you. Jim ---Original Message---From:   Paul Johnson, T   Sent: Monday, March 26, 20001 12:15 PMTo: Sanders, RichardCc: Derrick Jr., James; Evans, MarkSubject: Litigation reportA number of pieces of on going litigation and arbitration being conducted on behalf of EML and EMC have very recently come to our attention which we summarise below. We have endeavoured to establish the detail of these cases as quickly as possible, but in some instances await information from outside counsel involved. The summary is therefore necessarily provisional, and will need to be supplemented. There are in addition other claims of which we have been made aware, largely being run by MG Hong Kong and Beijing offices. Details are presently so sketchy that we have not included them until we have been able to verify. A supplementary note on these will follow asap.1. Corporacion Nacional del   Cobre de Chile (\"Codelco\" )   v.   MG Ltd, MGAG and MGCCThis is a major, and very serious claim being brought by the Chilean state copper trading company Codelco against, primarily MG AG of Frankfurt, but also against MG Ltd (now Enron Metals Ltd) for recission of futures contracts on the basis that they were procured by fraud (a bribe of US$1.5m paid to the main Codelco trader by MGAG). We have received a brief summary of the claim from Slaughter &amp; May, the lawyers handling the litigation on behalf of EML, which is attached below. As a result of an indemnity from MG AG, MG Ltd has NO financial exposure other than a credit risk to MG AG.Legal professional privilege must of course be maintained for this document and its contents, and any dissemination outside the legal dept should be made subject to prior approval by legal.Trial is set down in the Chancery Division of the High Court in London for 5-6 weeks, commencing October 20001. Significantly, and as you will be aware, High Court proceedings take place in public. - LT0108100084_3.doc2. MG Ltd v. China Resources National CorporationClaim in LME arbitration for payment of US$6m futures losses on client contracts. Award published in favour of MGL on liability alone in August 2000. Damages to be assessed. Thereafter Award to be enforced in China. Solicitors: Clyde &amp; Co.3. MG Ltd v. London Clearing HouseClaim in LME arbitration for delivery of defective tin under warrant. Losses believed to be US$8000,000. 7 day time bar defence run by the LCH heard as preliminary issue. Award in approx Feb 2000 in favour of MG (ie time bar inapplicable).

Nepco etalRob, Actually I sent out a demand letter, modelled on the demand letter you sent in the Glen Rice case, last Wednesday.   I thought that a copy had been sent to you, and I apologize if it has not.   (Lisa will be getting a copy to you this morning.)   I understood that you were on vacation and that Bob was going to be out on vacation on Thursday and Friday.   Because of the problem with CT and the possibility that our answer date would be as soon as this Thursday, 3/222, I didn't think it should wait until today.   When the service of process came in, I spoke with Andy Edison about it, he advised me of the Glen Rice matter, I pulled the file which included a copies of the contract, the certificate of insurance for Feb 2000-Feb 20001, and your demand letter.   I asked Lisa to get the 1999-2000 certificate of insurance, which we received on Wednesday. We then sent out the demand.   On Friday, I spoke with Chuck, who had spoken with Jim Studdert, and I suggested that, with Jim's and your concurrence, Bob handle the matter along with the Glen Rice matter, since I fully expect that the defense/indemnity demand will be accepted and I suspect the same outside counsel will be appointed.   In the meantime, I called and spoke with the plaintiff's counsel re the service problem with CT and that we had only recently received notice of the suit.   He agreed on an answer date of May 1st, which I am hopeful will give enough time for the defense/indemnity situation to be resolved.   I have asked Lisa to draft a Rule 111 agreement re the extended answer date which will be sent out today, and I anticipate that you, Lisa, and Bob will handle the matter from here.Please let me know if you have any questions re any of the above.

It covered the time period of 2/1/000 - 2/1/01.   We know have a new lawsuit with a date of loss of 12/21/999.   Can you fax me ASAP a certificate of insurance covering that loss date, presumably 2/1/999-2/1/000, assuming Zurich was Morrison's carrier for the preceding time period as well.   We would like to sent out the attached demand letter ASAP, like we did in the Rice matter, so that hopefully Morrison picks up our defense.   Also, does anyone from Nepco have any details concerning this incident?

By copy of this email, I am asking thatMiller and Virgo each advise me as to their availability then, or ifunavailable, the nearest alternate dates possible for each of them. I remind everyone that this case has a trial setting on September 4.If we cannot complete this initial discovery and set a mediation promptly,we will have the Hobson's choice either to delay the case further, or try itwith relatively little preparation time. I ask that Messrs. Miller and Virgo let me know about their schedules,either by reply email, or call me at 713-8444-30001. Thank you for your time and assistance. Best regards, Bill Ogden\n"

The refundwill take the form of deeply discounted forward sales commitments to theutilities.   The impetus for marketers or independent generators to play ballis the threat that FERC may revoke their authorization to make powerwholesales at market-based as opposed to regulated cost-based rates or takesome other punitive step.My concern is that this is a terribly one-sided negotiation.   Marketers andgenerators are being asked to put their profits on the table - profits thatFERC's general counsel's office and FERC itself have concluded they have nopower to touch - and proceed to negotiate against themselves.Enron has good people representing them in these FERC proceedings - SueMara, Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel and, when needed, my colleague RonCarroll.   What I am concerned about is that they do not have a concretestrategy or end game to pursue.   Among other things, Enron 's strategyshould include requiring the utilities, FERC   and the CPUC to put some valueon the table together with the marketers' and generators' profits.   As thesevalues may implicate strategy in the California civil actions, I thought Ishould run my thioughts by you.Specifically, I think Enron (and its allies) should insist that asprecondition of even considering discounted forward sales:1.   FERC and the CPUC must commit to file in the District Ct. actionpleadings in support of a motion ito dismiss the complaints on the ground ofexclusive FERC jurisdiciton.2.   FERC agree to vacate on rehearing as unsupported by substantial evidenceits December 15 finding that rates had been unjust and unreasonable.3.   The utilities and CPUC commit to auctioning off all or some largepercentage of the utilities' retail customer base.There may be other quid pro quo considerations.   I think it is imperativethat Enron decide now what they should be.   Politically (and quite likelycommercially) it is not an option for Enron to pull out of the FERCproceedings.   Therefore, we need to start changing what is at stake in theFERC proceeding and directing it toward our end game.Please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

How would you like Milbank to? allocate its time between the Farallon and Legg-Mason cases?To date, without really discussing it with you, we have (1) billed the Farallon and Legg-Mason cases separately and (2) allocated our time specifically relating to each case to that case but allocated \"common\" time entirely to the Farallon case.Is this what you want? Should we just send one bill for the two cases together? If we continue separate bills, what should be the allocation principle??? Should common time be allocated all to Farallon (the current practice)??? divided 50/50 between the two cases??? divided 18/5 between the two cases (i.e., allocated by the respective amounts in issue in the two cases) ?Any thoughts?

(\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and EnronEnergy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as \"EES\"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), and Portland General Electric Corporation(\"Portland General\")(collectively sometimes referred to as the \"EnronEntities\")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing the information specified on a timely basis.   We believe that thelimited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence itsinvestigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all ofthe potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by anystandard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents.We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating,offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have notwaived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and thatany claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or otherresponses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future,if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that areprotected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work productprivileges. Generally speaking, the Enron Entities propose to produce documentsfor year 2000 as noted below.   We also understand that the Commission willbe obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here toduplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.As you will see in the general documents that are offered here forproduction, Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. is the parent of EnronEnergy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage inwholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.   Thus, the documentsoffered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron EnergyServices, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.   We also do notpropose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, theburden and expense on them to locate, and produce every corporateorganizational chart anywhere in their organizations since April 1, 19998 issignificant.   The Enron Entities will provide the Commission with exemplarsof their current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called\"family trees\" to show its current organization.   To the extent that theEnron Entities can readily identify and locate exemplars of significantorganizational charts, telephone directories or so called \"family trees\" forearlier periods they will also make those available.   One Enron Entity,Portland General, has published books on its corporate history.   If a listof those books would be helpful, we can provide it.   With respect to theother Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found,they will be produced.   We anticipate producing these documents in the firstwave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.   We believe thisinformation will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for thestaff's purposes.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 111 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.   EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic transaction data ( the\"Transaction Documents\") for the purchase and sale of energy delivered whichinformation includes economic data.   We anticipate producing public filingsregarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic TransactionDocuments in the second wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there willprobably be limited documents available.   The Enron Entities to the extentthey act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resellgeneration output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to eachgeneration unit requested.   The Enron Entities, other than Portland General,do have documents and information for Las Vegas Cogeneration.   We propose toproduce these documents in the second wave of document productions.   For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.   As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.   In addition, thosetransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California arelimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two smallCalifornia municipal utilities.   Thus, the Commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO andPX.   Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of otherinformation until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell asignificant proportion of their energy into the California market.   At thattime a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effortwill be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation onthe California wholesale market.TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevanttransaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California andReal Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date,counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is apurchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want thisinformation, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete orinaccurate.   For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI'scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.   EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevantwholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect toretail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retailcustomers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'confidentiality obligations to those customers.   We anticipate producing theTransaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.   We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.   It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.   In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.   If you have any questions orcomments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Dayor myself.Brobeck Phleger &amp; Harrison LLPGary Fergus===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

A little chronology may help. Until around October or November of last year, V&amp;E's bills solely referenced the Grynberg II case.   Afterwards, due to Northern having removed the case, V&amp;E's bills included a seperate category for Quinque time.   Starting in January of 2000, however, V&amp;E's bills (the first one being for December time) introduced a third category for   \"Joint Defense Work\" time.   This third classification represented work done by V&amp;E on the proposed Quinque motion to dismiss for lack of standing, etc.(but not for lack of personal jurisdiction, which briefing is being done by Fulbright).   Basically, V&amp;E, Skadden and one other firm are putting together the draft motion to dismiss for lack of standing, etc.   Substantially all that work has already been done, according to Charlie.   The expectation was that, e.g., Enron would pay V&amp;E's fees up front, Sonat would pay Skadden's bills up front, etc., then all those who \"fronted\" such fees would recover those payments from other members of the joint defense committee, who would be billed pro rata. What Charlie called me to say is that if we have EOG pay 50% of the Joint Defense Work time category, then the Holland &amp; Hart trustee who eventually makes reimbursement will have to deal with an additional level of complexity in determining how the reimbursements will be made.   Charlie really left it up to us as to what we want to do; we just need to make sure that everyone (including, I guess, Holland &amp; Hart) understands that EOG will be one of the ones \"fronting\" the money to V&amp;E and entitled to receive reimbursement.   One the other hand, I got the impression that Charlie would appreciate it if Enron paid 1000% of the Joint Defense Billing (and accordingly got 1000% of any reimbursement), so that the reimbursement issue was not so complicated Frankly, I would not be surprised if Barry starts reconsidering the 50/50 split after he sees these most recent bills, given that the Jont Defense Billing is exclusively for Quinque work.   My thought is not to change how we pay the 50/50 split on the bills we have already received, but advise V&amp;E that for future bills, they can bill Enron 1000% of the Joint Defense Billing category. Please let me know how you all feel about this.   B.K.D.   \n"

(\"EOG\") that EOG will in all likelihood ask Pettman Smith (IGL's counsel in London) for an extension of the requested April 16 response date.If you have any questions or comments on this memorandum, or if I can be of further assistance in connection with this claim, please do not hesitate to call on me.Kind regards,Dan\n"

If it is not possible to clear the ISO Clearing Account on a PaymentDate because of an insufficiency of funds available in the ISO ReserveAccount or by enforcing any guarantee, letter of credit or other creditsupport provided by a defaulting Scheduling Coordinator, the ISO shallreduce payments to all ISO Creditors proportionately to the net amountspayable to them on the relevant Payment Data to the extent necessary toclear the ISO Clearing Account.   The ISO shall account for such reduction inthe ISO ledger accounts as amounts due and owing by the non-paying ISODebtor to each ISO Creditor whose payment was so reduced.As noted above, certain parties have defaulted on their GMC obligations tothe ISO.   The ISO has a priority claim to the collection of its GMC.   As aresult of non-payment of the GMC by the parties listed above, the ISOreduced the amounts payable to market participants by a total of $591,798.59to satisfy the ISO's GMC obligation.   This action was consistent withSettlements and Billing Protocol section 6.3.1.3.   Additionally, for thoseparties who defaulted on their GMC obligation to the ISO, but who were toreceive funds from the market, the ISO has reduced their payout to reflecttheir GMC default. SABP 6.3.1.3 The ISO is authorized to instruct the ISO Bank to debit the ISOClearing Account and transfer to the relevant ISO account sufficient fundsto pay in full the Grid Management Charge falling due on any Payment Day inpriority to any other payments to be made on that or on subsequent days outof the ISO Clearing Account.Amounts collected from any party are first used to settle that party'soldest outstanding amount payable, in accordance with SABP 6.10.4: SABP 6.10.4 The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of amounts owing toISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of the creation ofsuch debts.Accordingly, amounts received on 3/5/20001, were distributed to November 2000and December 2000 creditors.   Payments received from parties who defaultedin November were first applied to their November balances.   The $352,693.64was distributed to creditors for the trade month of November 2000.In accordance with Section 111.12 (and SABP 6.10.5) of the tariff, the ISOwill assess the defaulting parties interest at the ISO Default Interest Rate(currently 10.5%:   prime plus 2%).Certifications are required by Section 111.20.2 of the tariff.   Accordingly,the ISO will provide such certification to ISO creditors. 111.20.2 Evidence of Unpaid Amount. The ISO shall, on request, certify in writing the amounts owed by anISO Debtor that remain unpaid and the ISO Creditors to whom such amounts areowed and shall provide certified copies of the relevant Preliminary andFinal Settlement Statements, invoices, and other documentation on which theISO's certificate was based to the ISO Debtor and the relevant ISOCreditors.   An ISO certificate given under this Section 111.20.2 may be usedas prima facie evidence of the amount due by an ISO Debtor to ISO Creditorsin any legal proceeding.The ISO will report further details on this situation when available.Philip LeiberISO Treasurer and Director of Financial Planning(916) 351-2168===This message contains information which may be confidential and privileged.Unless you are the addressee (or authorized to receive for the addressee),you may not use, copy or disclose to anyone the message or any informationcontained in the message.

He has referred me to his attorney, Tom Walker, of Walker, Johnston, Barton and Powell, out of Birmingham.   Walker is Scottsboro's usual attorney.   I have left an urgent message with Walker, who is out of the office in a seminar today, and won't be back in until tomorrow, to call me immediately about getting an extension of time to answer in this matter from the plaintiff.   The answer date is Monday. Richard, given that Walker is not defending us, but Scottsboro, and the small size of this case ($15,000), do we need to pass this by Jim Derrick for his approval?   Given the short time frame before an answer is due, I will go forward with retaining him provisionally, at least to get an extension of time.

Briefly, ICTS of Athens, Alabama, one of MG Metals' shipping agents, has reportedly gone into bankruptcy, without paying about $80,000 owed to various motor carriers (truckers) for transportation here in the U.S of MG Metal's aluminum.   No one has yet confirmed that ICTS has in fact gone into bankruptcy.   MG Metals' offices in Canada and New York have begun receiving truckers' demand letters for these freight charges, some of which are from attorneys threatening suit.   These letters state that as consignee of the various cargoes, MG Metals is primarily liable for payment of the freight charges.   I think that this is generally correct as a matter of U.S. law, given the usual motor carrier bills of lading, although I am having this double-checked.   Since we have already paid most (but not all) of the money we owed to ICTS, MG Metals is looking at a double-payment exposure.   Also, even to the extent that ICTS has not been paid, it is entirely possible that ICTS overextended itself with a particular trucker and failed to charge MG Metals for enough to cover both ICTS's commission and the trucker's freight charges; in other words, a trucker may be looking for MG Metals to pay it more in freight than MG Metals originally agreed to pay ICTS (which amount should have covered both freight and commission).   I believe that the largest single amount claimed by a trucker is $15,000.   Bob Klide of MG's New York office and Nicole Dion of MG's Canada office (no relationship to Celine---I asked) will be shortly sending me their files.   To complicate things a bit more, many of the letters Nicole has received deal with shipments made in March, at a time when Nicole and her office were employees of a trading division of Barclay's.   Some time afterward, they were acquired by MG Metals.   As a result of this, Barclay's may (depending on the agreement between Barclay's and MG Metals) be on the hook for some of this liability.   Nicole advises she has place a Barclay's representative on notice.I would be happy to take this one off your plate if you would like.   Obviously, it is a small dollar case and we don't want to pay any money to anyone unless we absolutely have to.   Let me know.Britt\n"

Parenthetically, I'd be happy to explain how we got to where we are on our strategy; maybe a telephone call would be best.   Let me know when you are available.   I can call you early a.m. or late p.m.   Re the bug issue:   we were aware of this, although I am interested to hear that SGS raised it with you and Eric in mid-October.   I have discussed this in the past with David Best, and spoke with him on the telephone this morning about what SGS told you.   We don't think we should put anyone on notice about the bug issue unless and until it appears and is confirmed at the joint testing.   Otherwise, we may be raising an inherent vice argument for both Mitsubishi and our own cargo underwriters.   Let me know if you have a different view (on this or anything else I put in this e-mail). Re Mitsubishi's response to our settlement demand:   David Best has just spoken with Sian Heard, Mitsubishi's lead London solicitor.   It is clear from her that Mitsubishi will not be settling prior to instituting arbitration.   It is also clear that Mitsubishi will not consider any substantial settlement without Heard's advice.   Best believes that Heard will recommend that the joint testing take place before giving Mitsubishi an exposure evaluation.   In sum, while our attempt at settlement prior to joint testing was a worthwhile effort, to avoid the risk and expense of the problematic joint survey, it now appears to David and me to be at a dead end.Re the joint testing:   Again, David and I believe that the joint testing should proceed as quickly as it can be arranged.   Neither our cargo underwriters nor Mitsubishi will move off dead center unless we do so.   Given the problems with SGS's lab in Singapore, the \"bug\" issue that SGS in Subic Bay has raised (again), and that SGS did the pre-purchase of product for ECT that proved off-spec, I have asked David to re-visit with Steve Jones, our chemist, the logistics and cost of having the testing done in the U.K.   I have also asked him to consider whether Heard might be amenable to splitting the costs of transporting the samples from Singapore to the U.K.   I would like to get ECT's authority quickly to authorize the joint testing to go forward.Re the selection of arbitrators:   David has discussed three Q.C.s that he and Neale agreed were appropriate with Hearn.   Of those three, Hearn likes Nicholas Hamblin, who will charge 275 pounds an hour, and $1,750 pounds per day.   She will be conferring with Mitsubishi about using him as the sole arbitrator.   Given that we have initiated a good-faith discussion of the choice of arbitrators with Mitsubishi, David advises that we do not need to worry about sending Mitsubishi a letter tomorrow with our choices of arbitrator on it.   We can wait for Hearn to respond, then I will make a formal request for your authority to agree to one arbitrator who has already been accepted by Mitsubishi.Re the without-prejudice settlement of Mitsubishi's freight and demurrage:   I read you loud and clear (and thanks for making clear that the freight claim is only about $5000,000, not $760,000, as I had inadvertantly indicated in my last e-mail).   As I previously mentioned, David and I are on board with this idea, given the difficult circumstances of this case.Let me know if I have inadvertantly mischaracterized anything you said.Britt   \tPaul Henking@ECT\t111/09/2000 02:25 AM \t\t\t To: Britt Davis/Corp/Enron@ENRON\t\t\t cc: Alan Aronowitz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Harry M Collins/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael A Robison/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, James P Studdert/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Re: In re M/V PACIFIC VIRGObritt,thanks your reply which is noted. you will notice i have excluded david best and ngregson (?) preferring to keep my comments in house as privileged info, unless you feel this msg should be forwarded to them later.firstly, i am getting nowhere with mitsubishi on the settlement front. i have gone so far as to mention this morning to mitsuru that if this does goes to arbitration, and should mitsubishi succeed in their position, this will only serve to increase our claim by a similar amount since these costs would then become part of our contamination claim. he seems quite content to let this go to arbitration. as an example, he was suppose to call me back this afternoon but did not.secondly, with regards to your comments, i would just respond/add the following information:1. i don't know if i am switching tactics so much as following what should have been done in the beginning (i.e. submit the claim to our insurance company and let them proceed against the owners). i honestly feel the arbitrators will say, \"pay the freight (and possibly the demurrage now) and settle the contamination claim as a separate issue\". clearly, the c/p says that freight is due without deduction once the vessel has completed discharge.on the issue of the \"pre-sale\" survey, i have discussed this matter internally with eric tan. seems our position is that singapore considered the sample that was drawn as a bad sample as well as we were not sure that the test methods used conformed with the testing methods required for first gas. this position is proved by the loading of the pacific virgo when the product subsequently tested on-spec for first gas. granted, it might still become an issue but, as you say. it could become an issue in either proceeding.i am getting a little confused on the matter of the joint testing. verbally i was advised that enron did not want to have the joint testing - at least not on a prompt basis. your msg now says that we do want to test the product and it should be done as soon as possible (as mitsubishi - and your advices that the underwriters and hear owner's p and i club would want). i assume this change is the result of the arbitration. be that as it may, i do have a bit of information that you may, or may not, be aware of or find relevant. when eric tan and i visited first gas in mid-oct to meet the personnel at first gas and witness one of the cargoes being discharged at the plant, we also took the opportunity to meet with sgs in subic bay to see their facilities and meet their personnel. during the conversation the subject of the elang cargo came up and the comment from sgs is that they were fairly certain it was off-spec due to \"bugs\". this may sound silly but i have heard of this before and is a problem with petroleum products.it seems sgs even went so far as to test the product themselves for these \"bugs\" and got a positive result. this test was not requested by enron or first gas and was done some time later in this process. i understand there may be some concern on our part over our subsequent sales to third parties if we knew there were bugs in the product. i would have to say that this was not known at the time and even today is only conjecture based on sgs' advices mid-oct (well after these sales). sgs also described \"changes\" to the product which would fit with the cargo having bugs (i.e. a strong sulphur smell and change in colour).if the testing is now done, i do not know if these bugs will be detected or not. however, if they are in the ship's samples, they may have changed the sample sufficiently that even a visual observation may detect the problem. the next problem becomes proving from where the bugs originated. were they in the previous cargo tanks that were not cleaned properly? or were they in the condensate when the cargo was loaded? obviously, testing of the shore sample prior to loading will determine the answer. if the shore sample is ok, then they had to come from the ship. if the shore sample also has bugs, then we should be claiming against our suppliers.this of course assumes the suggestion put forth by sgs is in fact correct. just something else to be considered.2) i am not saying that we pay the full amount immediately but only the freight portion (about $5000,000). we then advise mitsubishi (or their lawyers) that we will now review the demurrage claim (about $260,000) and revert by say end nov. the demurrage claim has been sent to our london office's demurrage department and i have asked them for their comments on the claim. after all, there may be issues with the ship's pumping performance or simple laytime errors which may reduce the demurrage claim. they will try to get me a response before the weekend.in this manner, we pay part of the money but still have a smaller portion which we may apply against our claim once the test results are known. i will leave this to legal as to decide how the approach to mitsubishi or their lawyers should be madergds\n"

The only county in which HPL purchases gas from HLM is a well in Matagorda County.   There are no records of gas purchases from any well called Bowen #1 or Bowen #2.

You confirmed that you had not mentioned settlement to Interfert's attorneys; I assume that Interfert's attorneys have not raised the subject with us either.You also confirmed that Enron has no obligation to pay anything based simply on Mr. Cornuot's final report, which will have to be considered by the Court of Appeals of Versailles before it can become legally binding, and that Enron would likely have no obligation to pay any additional amounts until approximately the middle of 20002.   You advised that the parties' pleadings regarding Mr. Cornuot's report were not due to be filed with the Court of Appeals of Versailles until October 1, 20001 and that supplemental pleadings could be filed until January 17, 20002.   Oral argument (trial) before the Court of Appeal of Versailles was set for March 7, 20002.   Based on this, you did not expect the Court of Appeal of Versailles to render its decision until around June 20002.You have also inquired with our appellate experts as to when they expect a ruling from the Supreme Court of France, and expect a response within the next ten (10) days from now.You will have your legal assistant translate only those portions of Mr. Cornuot's final report that differ significantly from his preliminary report.   I would also appreciate it if you would send copies of the complete report to Christophe Casabonne and Michel Bouthonnet.   As soon as it becomes practical to do so, I would appreciate inquiry into how much Mr. Cornuot will request for his fees and expenses in this matter.You will also advise me of   (a) your attorney's fees and expenses outstanding, for your billed but unpaid time (if any); (b), for your accrued but unbilled time and expense; and &amp;copy;, for your estimated fees and expenses going forward, until the exhaustion of all appeals.Last, you confirmed that you frequently travelled to London and expected to be available for a conference in person with Richard in either Paris or London, at his convenience, around March 12, when Richard intends to be in London on other matters.Many thanks for your help.Regards,Britt \n"

Do we have any other agreements of this type with Power Systems?   Some claims that Enron may have against Power Systems such as claims for breach of warranty may have limitations periods that are approaching.   I believe we have discussed having Bracewell review the depositions and any documents related to the installation of the allegedly infringing systems into Enron's facilities.

They were most helpful.I agree that I have swung for the fences in that discussion, and I am not overly optimistic that FERC will reach out and specifically assert preemption (although its assertion of preemption could be implicit in its actions).   I thought that the argument that the market would be damaged by ongoing litigation might have some appeal at FERC, and it was worth a shot.Until I read your email, I thererfore saw no downside in asking.   The question that I have for you is how strong would an allegation in court be that the mere fact that we asked for a preemption finding, as to which FERC did not address, constitutes a negative finding that FERC elected not to assert preemption.   Not having done the research, my sense was that such a result would have no precedential effect, along the lines that a denial a cert by the Supreme Court is not precedential.   This is an important point.   Perhaps we could schedule a call with Mary, et al., to discuss strategy.   Ron&lt;&lt;&lt; \"Fergus, Gary S.\" &lt;GFergus@brobeck.com&lt; 12/01/000 12:04AM &lt;&lt;&lt;Ron, Your latest draft has minimized the earlier concerns that I had.You are definitely swinging for a preemption home run ball in the San Diegolitigation.   In response to Question No. 4, you are asking FERC tospecifically to find that it is preempting investigations of last summersmarket, find that the rates charged were just and reasonable and determinethat sellers are immune from refund under any possible legal theory.   Thereis some risk if we ask for this finding and do not get it, that fact willdiminish arguments we might have in state or federal court that there hasbeen preemption.   As a practical matter, however, our preliminary researchhas shown that without a very specific intent to preempt anti-trust laws,for example, the preemption argument may be difficult to make anyway.   Iknow that this may be the one chance we have to get FERC to make a finding.If FERC does make the finding, it will undoubtedly be appealed.   I do notknow how to assess the likelihood that FERC will make the requested finding,and if they do whether it will be upheld on appeal, so it is difficult forme to do a risk benefit analysis. If we are going to go this route, I would take out the conditionalphrase on page 7 in the word version that reads:   \"if they were not inviolation of market rules established under the ISO's and PX's tariffs.\" I know Mary is still working on the economics response.   I will lookat as soon as it comes in.ThanksGary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

While I am no longer on the legal side of the fence, I want to pass on to you my strong recommendation for you to consider using O'Melveny &amp; Myers, in particular for California litigation,   but perhaps in other areas.   Over the past 2 years, we used O'Melveny in connection with the wind cos dispute with Florida Power &amp; Light, and they did a great job.   O'Melveny is one of the 2 or 3 largest firms in California and probably one of its oldest and finest.   One of their litigation partners (and good personal friend of mine) is named Brian Curry, and if you have any interest in meeting these guys, they would very much like the chance to meet you.   Please let me know if there might be any interest.   I hope all is well with you and your family.   Best regards. Adam \n"

Paine Webber refused and she then asked us to honour the obligation in any event or to change her employment termination date.   In consultation with Enron Corp. (Mary Joyce and Michael Fauerbacher) the request was denied.   She has now sued both Enron Canada Corp. and Enron Corp. in the Alberta courts.   The amount is not large ($US27,000) but he principle and precedent value is.   I think our position is very strong but there are some issues around the calculation of days from termination and performance required on non-business days (which is not provided for in the grant agreements).   I have a call with Mary Joyce and Michael Fauerbacher of Enron Corp. tomorrow and was going to involve litigation counsel - Dalton McGrath - a partner at Blake Cassels and Graydon who is in my estimation very effective and aggressive.   Is this OK with you and/or do we need to involve outside counsel in Houston to monitor Enron Corp.'s interests?Please let me know your thoughts.Thanks and regards, Peter.\n"

Unfortunately, without the involvement of Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was subject to our standard ISDA documentation.   The Confirm was sent out on that basis but not executed by the counterparty.   There was some agreement on guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).   Mike McCachen has a good understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.   Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good understanding of out trading business.   Mike is a little more aggressive than Clarke, to my preference.We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.Peter.\n"

Also, please let me know if there are any new items that should be considered.Please respond no later than Wednesday May 2.Gary3-6841114   LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES   Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items of which are discussed below.   Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate reserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such items, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.   Litigation.   In 19995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harris County District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company (Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company andPanhandle Gas Company (collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron.   The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners under numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have terminated.   Early in 19996, the case was severed by the Court into two matters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.   In the first matter, the Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the \"Panhandle program,\" a special marketing program established in the early 1980s.   This case was tried in October 19996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.   In the second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated state regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing to take the Plaintiffs' gas ratably with other producers' gas at certain times between 1978 and 19888.   The trial court certified a class action with respect to ratability claims.   On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the trial court's class certification was improper and remanded the case to the trial court.   The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs' claims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statute of limitations.   The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal and factual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.   Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.   On November 21, 19996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vidal Building in San Juan, Puerto Rico.   The explosion resulted in fatalities, bodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.   San Juan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a propane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide service to the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance carriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties, including The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and SewerAuthority, Puerto Rico Telephone Company, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their insurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico. These suits seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and property damage allegedly caused by the explosion.   After nearly four years without determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not to litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements or trials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the explosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The defendants have agreed on a fund for settlements orfinal awards. Numerous claims have been settled. Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.   Trojan Investment Recovery.   In early 19993, PGE ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power generating facility.   The OPUC granted PGE, through a general rate order, recovery of, and a return on, 87 percent of its remaining investment in Trojan.   The OPUC's general rate order related to Trojan has been subject to litigation in various state courts, including rulings by the Oregon Court of Appeals and petitions to the Oregon Supreme Court filed by parties opposed to the OPUC's order, including the Utility Reform Project(URP) and the Citizens Utility Board (CUB).   In August 2000, PGE entered into agreements with CUB and the staff of the OPUC to settle the litigation related to PGE's recovery of its investment in the Trojan plant.   Under the agreements, CUB agreed to withdraw from the litigation and to support the settlement as the means to resolve the Trojan litigation.   The OPUC approved the accounting and ratemaking elements of the settlement on September 29, 2000.   As a result of these approvals, PGE's investment in Trojan is no longer included in rates charged to customers, either through a return on or a return of that investment.   Collection of ongoing decommissioning costs at Trojan is not affected by the settlement agreements or the September 29, 2000 OPUC order.   With CUB's withdrawal, URP isthe one remaining significant adverse party in the litigation. URP has indicated that it plans to continue to challenge the OPUC order allowing PGE recovery of its investment in Trojan.   Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.   Although no assurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.   Environmental Matters.   Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.   These laws and regulations require expenditures in connection with theconstruction of new facilities, the operation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating sites.   The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to result in increased operating expenses.   These increased operating expenses are not expected to have a material impact on Enron's financial position or results of operations.   Enron's natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater remediation on a number of their facilities.   Enron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.\n"

Litigation and Other Contingencies\r   Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=\rf=20\rwhich are discussed below.   Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20\rbelieves, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=\r=20\rreserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=\r=20\ritems, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=\r=20\rimpact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.\r Litigation.   In 19995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=\rs=20\rCounty District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20\r(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20\r(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20\rsubsidiary of Enron.   The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=\r=20\runder numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20\rterminated.   Early in 19996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20\rmatters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.   In the first matte=\rr,=20\rthe Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20\rnegligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&amp;Panhandle program,=\r=018 a=20\rspecial marketing program established in the early 1980s.   This case was=20\rtried in October 19996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.   =\rIn=20\rthe second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=\r=20\rstate regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=\r=20\rto take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=\rain=20\rtimes between 1978 and 19888.   The trial court certified a class action with=\r=20\rrespect to ratability claims.   On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20\rruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=\red=20\rthe case to the trial court.   The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=\r=20\rclaims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=\re=20\rof limitations.   The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=\rnd=20\rfactual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.   Although no=\r=20\rassurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=\rse=20\rmatters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=\rr=20\rresults of operations.\r   On November 21, 19996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=\rl=20\rBuilding in San Juan, Puerto Rico.   The explosion resulted in fatalities,=\r=20\rbodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.   San=\r=20\rJuan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan), an Enron subsidiary, operated a=20\rpropane/air distribution system in the vicinity.   Although San Juan did not=\r=20\rprovide service to the building, the National Transportation Safety Board=\r=20\r(NTSB) concluded that the probable cause of the incident was propane leakin=\rg=20\rfrom San Juan=01,s distribution system.   San Juan and Enron strongly disagr=\ree. =20\rThe NTSB found no path of migration of propane from San Juan=01,s system to=\r the=20\rbuilding and no forensic evidence that propane fueled the explosion.   Enron=\r,=20\rSan Juan, and four San Juan affiliates have been named, along with several=\r=20\rthird parties, as defendants in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District=20\rCourt for the district of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico=\r. =20\rThese suits, which seek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, busine=\rss=20\rinterruption and property damage, allege that negligence of Enron, San Juan=\r=20\rand its affiliates, among others, caused the explosion.   Enron, San Juan an=\rd=20\rits affiliates are vigorously contesting the claims.   Although no assurance=\rs=20\rcan be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters=\r=20\rwill not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or result=\rs=20\rof operations.\r   Trojan Investment Recovery.   In early 19993, PGE ceased commercial operatio=\rn=20\rof Trojan.   In April 19996 a circuit court judge in Marion County, Oregon,=\r=20\rfound that the OPUC could not authorize PGE to collect a return on its=20\rundepreciated investment in Trojan, contradicting a November 19994 ruling fr=\rom=20\rthe same court.   The ruling was the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 1=\r9995=20\rgeneral rate order which granted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of i=\rts=20\rremaining investment in Trojan.   The 19994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon=\r=20\rCourt of Appeals and was stayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 1=\r9995=20\rorder.   Both PGE and the OPUC separately appealed the April 19996 ruling,=20\rwhich appeals were combined with the appeal of the November 19994 ruling at=\r=20\rthe Oregon Court of Appeals.   On June 24, 19998, the Court of Appeals of the=\r=20\rState of Oregon ruled that the OPUC does not have the authority to allow PG=\rE=20\rto recover a rate of return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan=\r=20\rgenerating facility.   The court upheld the OPUC=01,s authorization of PGE=\r=01,s=20\rrecovery of its undepreciated investment in Trojan.\r   PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=\r=20\rCourt.   On August 26, 19998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=\r=20\rreview with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=\r=20\rOregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20\rundepreciated investment in Trojan.   On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=\r=20\rCourt accepted the petitions for review.   On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=\rll=20\r32220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=\rd=20\rinvestment in property retired from service was signed.   One of the effects=\r=20\rof the bill is to affirm retroactively the OPUC=01,s authority to allow PGE=\r=01,s=20\rrecovery of a return on its undepreciated investment in the Trojan generati=\rng=20\rfacility.\r   Relying on the new legislation, on July 2, 1999, PGE requested the Oregon=\r=20\rSupreme Court to vacate the June 24, 19998, adverse ruling of the Oregon Cou=\rrt=20\rof Appeals, affirm the validity of the OPUC=01,s order allowing PGE to reco=\rver a=20\rreturn on its undepreciated investment in Trojan and to reverse its decisio=\rn=20\raccepting the Utility Reform Project=01,s petition for review.   The Utility=\r=20\rReform Project and the Citizens Utility Board, another party to the=20\rproceeding, opposed such request and submitted to the Oregon Secretary of=\r=20\rState sufficient signatures in support of placing a referendum to negate th=\re=20\rnew legislation on the November 2000 ballot.   The Oregon Supreme Court has=\r=20\rindicated it will defer hearing the matter until after the November 2000=20\relections.   Enron cannot predict the outcome of these actions.   Additionall=\ry,=20\rdue to uncertainties in the regulatory process, management cannot predict,=\r=20\rwith certainty, what ultimate rate-making action the OPUC will take regardi=\rng=20\rPGE=01,s recovery of a rate of return on its Trojan investment.   Although n=\ro=20\rassurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=\rse=20\rmatters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=\rr=20\rresults of operations.\r   Environmental Matters.   Enron is subject to extensive federal, state and=\r=20\rlocal environmental laws and regulations.   These laws and regulations requi=\rre=20\rexpenditures in connection with the construction of new facilities, the=20\roperation of existing facilities and for remediation at various operating=\r=20\rsites.   The implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments is expected to=\r=20\rresult in increased operating expenses.   These increased operating expenses=\r=20\rare not expected to have a material impact on Enron=01,s financial position=\r or=20\rresults of operations.\r   The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed Enron that it is a=\r=20\rpotentially responsible party at the Decorah Former Manufactured Gas Plant=\r=20\rSite (the Decorah Site) in Decorah, Iowa, pursuant to the provisions of the=\r=20\rComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCL=\rA,=20\ralso commonly known as Superfund).   The manufactured gas plant in Decorah=\r=20\rceased operations in 1951.   A predecessor company of Enron purchased the=20\rDecorah Site in 1963.   Enron=01,s predecessor did not operate the gas plant=\r and=20\rsold the Decorah Site in 1965.   The EPA alleges that hazardous substances=\r=20\rwere released to the environment during the period in which Enron=01,s=20\rpredecessor owned the site, and that Enron=01,s predecessor assumed the=20\rliabilities of the company that operated the plant.   Enron contests these=\r=20\rallegations.   To date, the EPA has identified no other potentially=20\rresponsible parties with respect to this site.   Under the terms of=20\radministrative orders, Enron replaced affected topsoil and removed impacted=\r=20\rsubsurface soils in certain areas of the tract where the plant was formerly=\r=20\rlocated.   Enron completed the final removal actions at the site in November=\r=20\r19998 and concluded all remaining site activities in the spring of 1999. =20\rEnron submitted a final report on the work conducted at the site to the EPA=\r. =20\rEnron does not expect to incur material expenditures in connection with thi=\rs=20\rsite.\r   Enron=01,s natural gas pipeline companies conduct soil and groundwater=20\rremediation on a number of their facilities.   Enron does not expect to incu=\rr=20\rmaterial expenditures in connection with soil and groundwater remediation.\r   \n"

The explosion resulted in fatalities,=\r=20\rbodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.   San=\r=20\rJuan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20\rpropane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=\re=20\rto the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance=\r=20\rcarriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20\rincluding The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=\rne=20\rCompany, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20\rinsurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=\rhe=20\rDistrict of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.   These suits=\r=20\rseek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and=\r=20\rproperty damage allegedly caused by the explosion.   After nearly four years=\r=20\rwithout determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not=\r=20\rto litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =\ror=20\rtrials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the=\r=20\rexplosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The=\r=20\rdefendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous=\r=20\rsuits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal=\r=20\rcourt beginning in February 20001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=\rn=20\rbelieves that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20\rmaterial adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.\r   Trojan Investment Recovery.   In early 19993, Portland General Electric=20\rCompany (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20\rgenerating facility (Trojan).   In April 19996 a circuit court judge in Mario=\rn=20\rCounty, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=\rd=20\rnot authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20\rTrojan, contradicting a November 19994 ruling from the same court.

The 19994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=\rs=20\rstayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 19995 order.   Both PGE and =\rthe=20\rOPUC separately appealed the April 19996 ruling, which appeals were combined=\r=20\rwith the appeal of the November 19994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=\r =20\rOn June 24, 19998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=\re=20\rOPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=\rn=20\rits undepreciated investment in Trojan.   The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20\rauthorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=\rn.\r   PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=\r=20\rCourt.

Please update the section of the disclosure for which=\r=20\ryou are responsible for inclusion in the third quarter 2000 Form 10Q .   Als=\ro,=20\rplease let me know if there are any new items that should be considered.\r Please respond no later than Monday October 30.\r Gary\r3-6841\r   3.   Litigation and Other Contingencies\r   Enron is a party to various claims and litigation, the significant items o=\rf=20\rwhich are discussed below.   Although no assurances can be given, Enron=20\rbelieves, based on its experience to date and after considering appropriate=\r=20\rreserves that have been established, that the ultimate resolution of such=\r=20\ritems, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse=\r=20\rimpact on Enron=01,s financial position or its results of operations.\r   Litigation.   In 19995, several parties (the Plaintiffs) filed suit in Harri=\rs=20\rCounty District Court in Houston, Texas, against Intratex Gas Company=20\r(Intratex), Houston Pipe Line Company and Panhandle Gas Company=20\r(collectively, the Enron Defendants), each of which is a wholly-owned=20\rsubsidiary of Enron.   The Plaintiffs were either sellers or royalty owners=\r=20\runder numerous gas purchase contracts with Intratex, many of which have=20\rterminated.   Early in 19996, the case was severed by the Court into two=20\rmatters to be tried (or otherwise resolved) separately.   In the first matte=\rr,=20\rthe Plaintiffs alleged that the Enron Defendants committed fraud and=20\rnegligent misrepresentation in connection with the =01&amp;Panhandle program,=\r=018 a=20\rspecial marketing program established in the early 1980s.   This case was=20\rtried in October 19996 and resulted in a verdict for the Enron Defendants.   =\rIn=20\rthe second matter, the Plaintiffs allege that the Enron Defendants violated=\r=20\rstate regulatory requirements and certain gas purchase contracts by failing=\r=20\rto take the Plaintiffs=01, gas ratably with other producers=01, gas at cert=\rain=20\rtimes between 1978 and 19888.   The trial court certified a class action with=\r=20\rrespect to ratability claims.   On March 9, 2000, the Texas Supreme Court=20\rruled that the trial court=01,s class certification was improper and remand=\red=20\rthe case to the trial court.   The Enron Defendants deny the Plaintiffs=01,=\r=20\rclaims and have asserted various affirmative defenses, including the statut=\re=20\rof limitations.   The Enron Defendants believe that they have strong legal a=\rnd=20\rfactual defenses, and intend to vigorously contest the claims.   Although no=\r=20\rassurances can be given, Enron believes that the ultimate resolution of the=\rse=20\rmatters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position o=\rr=20\rresults of operations.\r   On November 21, 19996, an explosion occurred in or around the Humberto Vida=\rl=20\rBuilding in San Juan, Puerto Rico.   The explosion resulted in fatalities,=\r=20\rbodily injuries and damage to the building and surrounding property.   San=\r=20\rJuan Gas Company, Inc. (San Juan Gas), an Enron affiliate, operated a=20\rpropane/air distribution system in the vicinity, but did not provide servic=\re=20\rto the building. Enron, San Juan Gas, four affiliates and their insurance=\r=20\rcarriers were named as defendants, along with several third parties,=20\rincluding The Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, Puerto Rico Telepho=\rne=20\rCompany, Heath Consultants Incorporated, Humberto Vidal, Inc. and their=20\rinsurance carriers, in numerous lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for t=\rhe=20\rDistrict of Puerto Rico and the Superior Court of Puerto Rico.   These suits=\r=20\rseek damages for wrongful death, personal injury, business interruption and=\r=20\rproperty damage allegedly caused by the explosion.   After nearly four years=\r=20\rwithout determining the cause of the explosion, all parties have agreed not=\r=20\rto litigate further that issue, but to move these suits toward settlements =\ror=20\rtrials to determine whether each plaintiff was injured as a result of the=\r=20\rexplosion and, if so, the lawful damages attributable to such injury. The=\r=20\rdefendants have agreed on a fund for settlements or final awards. Numerous=\r=20\rsuits have been settled and 20 cases have been set for trial in the federal=\r=20\rcourt beginning in February 20001. Although no assurances can be given, Enro=\rn=20\rbelieves that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a=20\rmaterial adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations.\r   Trojan Investment Recovery.   In early 19993, Portland General Electric=20\rCompany (PGE) ceased commercial operation of the Trojan nuclear power=20\rgenerating facility (Trojan).   In April 19996 a circuit court judge in Mario=\rn=20\rCounty, Oregon, found that the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) coul=\rd=20\rnot authorize PGE to collect a return on its undepreciated investment in=20\rTrojan, contradicting a November 19994 ruling from the same court.   The ruli=\rng=20\rwas the result of an appeal of PGE=01,s March 19995 general rate order which=\r=20\rgranted PGE recovery of, and a return on, 87% of its remaining investment i=\rn=20\rTrojan.   The 19994 ruling was appealed to the Oregon Court of Appeals and wa=\rs=20\rstayed pending the appeal of the OPUC=01,s March 19995 order.   Both PGE and =\rthe=20\rOPUC separately appealed the April 19996 ruling, which appeals were combined=\r=20\rwith the appeal of the November 19994 ruling at the Oregon Court of Appeals.=\r =20\rOn June 24, 19998, the Court of Appeals of the State of Oregon ruled that th=\re=20\rOPUC does not have the authority to allow PGE to recover a rate of return o=\rn=20\rits undepreciated investment in Trojan.   The court upheld the OPUC=01,s=20\rauthorization of PGE=01,s recovery of its undepreciated investment in Troja=\rn.\r   PGE and the OPUC each filed petitions for review with the Oregon Supreme=\r=20\rCourt.   On August 26, 19998, the Utility Reform Project filed a petition for=\r=20\rreview with the Oregon Supreme Court seeking review of that portion of the=\r=20\rOregon Court of Appeals decision relating to PGE=01,s recovery of its=20\rundepreciated investment in Trojan.   On April 29, 1999, the Oregon Supreme=\r=20\rCourt accepted the petitions for review.   On June 16, 1999, Oregon House Bi=\rll=20\r32220 authorizing the OPUC to allow recovery of a return on the undepreciate=\rd=20\rinvestment in property retired from service was signed.

In that discussion I reiterated what was discussed at the 8/2/000 Board meeting which was:   a) we needed to finalize the numbers re: the WMI royalty renegotiation; b) verify the expected EPC costs to complete the project; c) revise the project pro-forma to reflect the revisions in (a) and (b) and d) run sensitivity analyses on the level of subordination Wisvest would have to accept in order to make the project economics viable.   In our phone conversation on 8/4/000 we again agreed this was the right course of action to take.   Subsequent to that call, JB had conversations w/ Derek Price at Wisvest re: prospective meeting dates and exchanging various info re: the project.   In another phone conversation on Monday, August 7, I specifically asked JB whether he had sent the project pro-formas and/or other proprietary info to Derek Price to which JB responded \"no.\"   He said he \"... sent him summary info ... but did NOT send him the pro-forma ...\"   I then asked him to forward to me copies of everything he had sent to Derek.   What he sent to me was some very basic e-mails and financial summary info.   I also asked Derek to forward to me everything JB had sent to him and I got a whole lot more, including the full-blown project model/pro-forma.   This has seriously diminished all of our negotiating leverage!On 8/10/000, I became aware of some efforts that appear to involve JB in setting up a South American version of Ecogas (Ecogas S.A.) and called him to inquire as to what was going on.   In our phone conversation JB explicitly denied \"any involvement\" including any \"ownership\" in such an enterprise.   I also asked JB to forward to me by Friday, 8/111/000, copies of any and all documents, agreements, etc... relating to Ecogas S.A.   To date he has sent me nothing but an undated DRAFT MOU as well as some misc and meaningless correspondence (undated and/or old e-mails, etc...).   None of the info sent is what I asked for on August 4 (complete execution copies of the MOU regarding Ecogas S.A. including ownership interests, etc... as well as copies of Articles of Incorporation for Ecogas S.A., etc...Who is Ecogas S.A.?   Where is it currently incorporated?   Who are the beneficial owners?   Under what authority are you transacting business (what is your title, etc...)   JB continues to reference \"nothing has been signed, incorporated, etc...\" - then why is JB's signature evidenced on an \"Amendment\" to the \"Memorandum of Understanding:   Ecogas S.A. - Tortola/JCS\"?   JB referenced the need to \"directing our efforts to resolution of the crisis, rather than continuing personal distractions and devisiveness.\"   For the past couple of months he has been asked to generate cash by selling assets, greenhouse gas emission credits, etc...   To the best of my knowledge Ecogas has yet to see one penny!As always there seems to be a direct contradiction between the \"stories\" and the facts!\n"

Ingrid is the HR person at MG MCC,the New York branch of MG plc.   MG plc has acquired Rudolph Wolff, anotherBritish company.   Rudolph wolfe has the two H1 and one L1 visa employees.It turns out that MG plc is doing an asset acquisition of Rudolph Wolff,not a stock transfer, and Ingrid's immigration attorney tells her that theycannot transfer an L1 in an asset transfer.   Ingrid is starting the processof transferring the H1's from RW to MG.   I do not know how much ingridknows about visas, and it would probably be good if we guided her so thatshe does not so something that impacts us or that is unnecessary.Ingrid has a thick file of immigration \"stuff\" on these folks but she doesnot know what to send to us.   Could you give her a call and talk to herabout the situation?   I am concerned that i am not asking her the rightquestions, or I may garble the info when I pass it on to you.   Ingrid is at212.715.5241.   I told her that you might call.closing is forecast for Sept. 8; i may be in NY either this monday or thefollowing monday collecting data.   I would be happy to sit with you andtell you what I know , or join in on the call to ingrid.

I also understand that Enron Clean Fuels Company has chartered a vessel from Chembuk Trading which our broker advised to be an affiliate of MTM Ship Management (the bareboat charterers of the Pacific Valour and the likely respondents in an arbitration).I presume the decision is therefore not to take the matter to arbitration and would like to close my file on the matter.

I told him that he might be asking questions by himself, or he might be in with other lawyers.? (He seemed surprised that other lawyers might be there.)If we can work it out, I think it would be best to have Kevin and Brian interviewed by Swartz separately rather than with other lawyers.? If Mike is in the large group interviews, I fear that we will not, as a practical matter, be able to draw the kinds of lines that we would like to.? For example, I would just as soon not have Farallon's counsel present when Kevin or Brian addresses the questions in Robins, Kaplan's letter of 6/13 that I just received.Steve This e-mail message may contain legally privileged and/or confidential information.

The following sets forth the deadline schedule that I obtained from Pacer regarding this matter: 1)   6/12/000   - Voting Record Date to determine which creditors or entitled to vote to   accept or reject the Plan 2)   7/21/000 @ 4:000 pm   - Objections due to Confirmation of the Plan 3)   7/21/000 @ 4:000 pm   - Deadline for ballots to accept or reject the Plan 4)   7/27/000 @ 9:30 am   - Confirmation hearing on the Plan 5)   7/31/000 @ 4:000 pm   - Objections due to assignment by Adair Supply 6)   8/14/000 @ 111:30 am   - Hearing re objections to claims of Enogex Expl.I obtained from PACER a copy of the Claims Register Report and it lists ECT as having filed a claim on 3/23/000---but it does not reflect how much is the total claim.   Also, included in Debtor's 2d Amended Jt Disclosure Statement, it reflects that   Class 4 Creditors consists of all Allowed Unsecured Claims including ECT's claim arising from the termination of an Option (Corridor) dated 5/28/999 between MPC and Enron and the Confirmation of an Option (Collar) dated 111/6/98 between MPC and Enron (the \"Enron Swaps\").I would appreciate your help with answering the following questions:1)   Was a Proof of Claim filed on behalf of ECT and for how much?2)   Who is the person who will handle filing out and signing the Ballot on behalf of ECT either rejecting or accepting the Plan [which is due to be filed on or before 7/21/000].3)   If we are not owed any monies by Michael Petroleum, or have not asserted a claim against Michael Petroleum, then we can disregard sending in the ballot on behalf of ECT.   I have copies of all these documents, so if you need me to send you anything, please let me know.   I appreciate your help with this and please call me if any of this information is confusing.

After \"sinking\" his mind into the facts, Dan was of the view that a two pronged legal approach could be taken:   1.   take one of our apparently frequent direct purchases   from Puget at Mid-C as   a test case and when Puget refuses to honor the schedule which requires it to be sunk at COB, sue them in a state court,   and 2.   bring a complaint against Puget at Ferc allegding conduct in breach of the Federal Power Act.   There is enough wrong about this situation to cause Dan to say that both actions were potentially available.   The real issue now is,   do we want to disrupt our business relationship with Puget and WWP by taking either or both of these actions?

In the pace of the year-end I forgot to inform you of a piece of litigation commenced by Enron Canada.   The litigation is against NGX Canada Inc. and Canadian Enerdata, and their shareholders, Westcoast Energy and OM Groupen for NGX, and Richard Zarzeczny for Canadian Enerdata.It is somewhat complicated.   In brief, NGX operates an electronic natural gas trading brokerage which suffered competitively after the onset of Enron Online, and Enerdata publishes the only available and reliable natural gas indices for our market.   Traditionally the indices were based upon a comprehensive survey of fixed-price physical gas transactions over the broad market.   Presumably to coerce business onto the NGX system, and with two days' notice, NGX purchased the right to calculate the indices (as opposed to Enerdata itself or the publication itself) and changed the methodology for the indices to include only trades completed on NGX's system.   The result is the indices are, for contractual purposes, quite cleverly unchanged and therefore still as described in hundreds of our trading contracts and thousands of transactions, but in substance have been changed to represent only NGX's segment of the market, which introduces unmanageable volatility and unreliability, and is affected by other limitations such as the ability to trade with NGX for a variety of reasons, including credit restrictions or electronic failure. [ex.   We have contracts to buy and sell Coke, somebody bought the formula for Coke, changed it to Sprite, put the Sprite in the Coke can, such that we are now forced to buy and sell Sprite under the auspices of contracts to buy and sell Coke.]In any event, no commercial alternative was viable, and we decided to commence a law suit based upon interference with economic relations, interference with contractual relations, breach of obligations of good faith, civil conspiracy and passing off.   All are viable claims but difficult to prove.   We have to get past simply being outsmarted.   We have also decided not to involve regulators or antitrust enforcement.   The discovery process will be key, and we hope to influence a commercial result that includes all electronic trading systems, including Enron Online, into the indices. The lawsuit is for injunctive relief (which will be particularly difficult) and damages of C$1000MM.   We hope to garner industry support, but to date and as usual, many parties agree with our position but are not willing to get involved.   Some competitors are also happy to segregate Enron Online from the rest of the market.In terms of counsel, we initially were going to use Robert Anderson of Blake Cassels &amp; Graydon, who we have used on many matters, but Blakes was conflicted after the injunction papers were served.   We had to find replacement counsel on short notice and, with the recommendation of Blakes but based primarily on my prior experiences, retained Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon.My apologies for not letting you know sooner.   I had discussed the matter with Mark before commencing the suit, and Mark asked me to drop you and Richard a line, but I simply forgot.   If you have any questions or concerns, please call at 403.974.6923.   If I don't hear from you, all the best for the holidays.Peter.\n"

His view of appropriate Enron team members included:   David Leboe, Brian Vass, Brian Barth and Kevin McConville.He mentioned the existence of a certain memorandum regarding a visit to Thailand that Vass and myself performed during late 19998 to address accounting and reporting concerns.   I did not comment on the existence of the memo.Please find this memo included as an attachment.

Nothingfancy or time consuming, just a brief updateFor example:Today:   (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have todisclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 19998, even aboutMarch 19998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice ofcounsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred rulingwhether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 19998concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.   (I want to find outwhat this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)   (2)   Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort byNatwest to postpone the trial in California until September.   I don't thinkNatwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.   I am notplanning for   ECT Securities to take a position.   (3)   We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath's report, afterremoving a big section discussing Hellmold's report in light of Tom Hatch'sstatement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECTSecurities.Later this week:   Hellmold's deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY. I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say, or notsay, about ECT Securities.Do you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about Ponti Singh's depo (andalso her remark on the street to Brian that McDonald is going to blame Enronfor something concerning related party transactions?Steve HowardAlschuler Grossman Stein &amp; Kahan LLPphone: 310-407-7613fax: 310-5552-60777cell:   213-716-0536e-mail:   showard@agsk.com   ...ALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN &amp; KAHAN LLPATTORNEYS AT LAWww.agsk.com2049 Century Park EastThirty-Ninth FloorLos Angeles, CA 900067-3213Tel 310-2777-12226Fax 310-5552-60777This transmission is intended only for the useof the addressee and may contain informationthat is privileged, confidential and exempt fromdisclosure under applicable law.

I also spoke with Tom Deen, who wants to sendrevisions after Natole has read the document, which Natole can't do nowbecause he's travelling. Deen says they will want at least 2 changes ofsubstance:1. Natole is asking for an indemnity from Enron and IBC for anyone whoclaims through them. I told him this was not something we had talked aboutbefore, and I wasn't sure how Enron would react to it, but my own reactionwas negative because Enron had no claims back against Natole (other thanfinancial offsets) so I fail to see why it's necessary. IBC is a differentmatter because IBC filed a counterclaim against Natole.2.   Deen wants the Natole indemnity to be capped at the amount ofsettlement. In other words, Natole indemnifies Enron &amp; IBC from claims byJung Ho (or others) only to the extent of $385,000. This again is not whatwe talked about, but as a practical matter I'm not sure how much differenceit makes. Everyone seems to view the likelihood of further claims as remote.Let me know your thoughts, and I'll forward any further proposals when I getthem. Best regards, Bill Ogden\n"

This case is a car wreck negligence case in which the plaintiff is claiming back and neck injuries as a result of allegedly been hit by a vehicle driven by Charles Thompson in the course and scope of his employment for Enron/HPL.

On the monies they owed us under the gas lift contract, we gave them until May 10th to respond or we would institute litigation.   The attorney for HH, Jim Williams, called me last week and basically laid it out that HH sold all of its assets to White Oak back in December (and we already had been so informed by White Oak), that HH doesn't have any assets left and we could go after the principals if we wanted but they probably wouldn't even file an answer and we could just get a judgment and renew it every ten years for as long as we pleased.   He offered a flat settlement amount of $15,000 on our claim of $35,284.95.   Steve has given me the authority to accept the offer but after doing so will ask about settling the $111,000.000 claim for the line repairs.   Quite honestly, I don't hold out much hope of HPL recovering anything more than $15,000 but that is $15,000 more than we have right now.   Also, since Gerald was working on the gas lift debt, I've asked him to notify credit and put HH and its principals on the credit risk list so that we don't do any more deals with them.\tCandace L Bywaters\t05/24/2000 06:222 AM \t\t\t To: Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: Nathan L Hlavaty/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ann Elizabeth White/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t Subject: Re: Outstanding Invoice - Houston HydrocarbonsAs I recall, we were trying to muscle HH into paying that invoice for line repairs via you, Richard.

As discussed below, we do not believe that there is anyadverse interest between Enron and these two companies, but Liz wanted you to becomfortable with her concurrent representation of these two other defendants.(As I may have mentioned before, many of the defendants in the joint defensegroup are represented by one law firm.   There is a commonality of interest inthe defenses to the Trust's claims.)The complaint against Arizona Public consists only of preference claims in theamount of $3000,000 and an objection to its $420,000 proof of claim.   GriffinEnergy has been sued for breach of contract, turnover, unjust enrichment,fraudulent transfer, etc.   Total amount of claims equal $530,000.   With Griffin,PCA failed to deliver power in May and the Griffin terminated its contract withPCA before the energy spikes began to occur.Liz has review the complaint against Enron and our draft answer and is aware ofour issues and defenses.   None of our defenses would be in conflict with thedefenses asserted by Arizona Power or Griffin.   If fact, many of the samedefenses would be raised.Both Arizona Public and Griffin would agree that if any sort of issue conflictcame up in the future or if Enron became otherwise uncomfortable with theconcurrent representations, Liz would withdraw from representing Arizona Powerand Griffin and they will waive any right to assert a conflict or seekdisqualification.Assuming that Arizona Public and Griffin Energy are not otherwise adverse toEnron in other matters (which Liz did not believe they were), are youcomfortable with these concurrent representations?   I believe that there may besome beneficial economies in the concurrent representations in that Liz's timeat hearings involving all defendants, etc. would be split among the defendants.However, if you're uncomfortable, then that's the end of the analysis.Liz is waiting to get back to Arizona Public and Griffin, so once you'vedecided, please let me know.

Twanda also left a message this morning.I am available at 3:000 on Wednesday, so consider that booked.   I'll come over toyour offices.   I have called the Trustee's counsel to propose times on Thursdaymorning.   Hopefully we can start around 10:30 am, and I would be surprised ifthis first conversation went more than an hour to an hour and one-half.   Ofcourse, I am planning on coming to your offices for the call on Thursday, but ifa lunch in the \"restuarant rich\" area of downtown holds any appeal, pleaseconsider coming down here and we'll go to lunch afterwards.I think it may be helpful if Elizabeth Sager is available on Wednesday to goover the how Enron calculated the Termination Payment (I know the payment waszero, but the amount of \"Gains\" to Enron under the Master Agreement may havesome bearing in connection with their unjust enrichment claims) and hercalculation of Enron's gain from selling the power otherwise deliverable to PCAin the market after the Master Agreement was terminated.   Elizabeth hasrecalculated the proper amount of EPMI's proof of claim, and it appears that theoriginal proof of claim was overstated a bit.You may have all this information --- but if not, Elizabeth does and we shouldget our arms around it.I'm going to be messengering to you today the Trust's mediation statement filedin connection with the other defendants.   I only have a fax, and if I fax it toyou, you won't be able to read it.   It would be beneficial for you to reviewthis statement as it sets forth the Trustee's position in more detail.   Itprovides the basis for their claim of unjust enrichment, even though I continueto believe that unjust enrichment is not available in connection with the MasterAgreement and EPMI's termination for unpaid invoices.I also think it would be helpful to connect Liz Austin into our conversation onWednesday so that she can advise you of her experience in mediating with theTrustee.   She has represented at least one other defendant who mediated with theTrust successfully.   Her insights of what to expect will be helpful.Thanks.***NOTE***The information contained in this email message is intended onlyfor use of the individual or entity named above.

MDSBonnie White@ENRON10/09/2000 04:555 PMTo: Mike D Smith/HOU/EEES@EEScc: Linda R Guinn/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Perk Development Corporation; Brambury Associates bankruptcyOn Friday, 10/06/000, we received through our service of process procedures, a certified mail envelope advising us of a default judgment in the amount of approximately $23,000 ($20,825.43 is the principal amount of the alleged preference payments, plus interest) against ECT in an adversary proceeding in the above-referenced consolidated bankruptcies.   The bankruptcies were filed in 19998 in the Western District of New York (Rochester).   We had not received any prior pleadings in the bankruptcy or the adversary.   I am trying to determine if this relates to ECT/ENA accounts or to EES accounts.   Please advise whether EES has/had any accounts with these entities and/or whether EES filed a claim in the bankruptcies.   I have spoken with counsel for the Plan Administrator who filed the adversary proceeding.   They apparently sent service of the adversary to ECT by certified mail addressed to our PO Box 111888, Houston address.   It never made it up to us.   In any event, I would like to determine as quickly as possible whose account it is and whether we have any defenses to the preference allegations.   Plan administrator's counsel has told me that he will hold off on executing on the judgment for 10-14 days to hear further from us.   If we can explain why we didn't receive service (I think our response is: you didn't serve our registered agent) and we can show defenses to the adversary, they will likely voluntarily set aside the default.   In any event, we need to determine this as soon as possible in case we need to file a motion to set aside the default judgment.   Thanks.\n"

ECTThis is the new matter that we received a notice of default judgment in the amount of $23,579.17 against ECT on Friday, 10/06.   I spoke this morning with David Reed, an associate with Harter, Secrest &amp; Emery LLP in Rochestor, New York, who is counsel for the Plan Administrator.   He said that he will speak with the partner in charge of this matter re whether they will voluntarily agree to lift default judgment, but he expects that they will so that neither side has to go through a hearing.   He will let me know sometime this week.   This is apparently a bankruptcy preference action.   He said that he will send to me today copies of the complaint, as well as any proof of service documentation.   I will forward it to you when I get it.   We can then get accounting documentation to determine whether we have valid defenses to the preference action.   Let me know if you'd like me to handle this, or if you want it handled in some other manner.   I don't anticipate that this will require a lot of time to evaluate and answer.   Thanks.\n"

Thanks\t\"J. ROBERT NELSON\" &lt;JRNELSON@LLGM.COM&lt;\t04/18/20001 12:57 PM \t\t\t To: Richard.B.Sanders@enron.com\t\t\t cc: CEKLUND@LLGM.COM\t\t\t Subject: Power ExchangeThe Committee interviewed financial advisors yesterday.   The list included PriceWaterhouse, KPMG, BDO, Stonefield Josephson and Neilson, Elggren.   The preference seemed to be PW, in major part because it was actively involved in creation of the Power Exchange systems.   There was an obvious concern about the potential for conflicts given PW's role for the PGE committee.   In that regard, we were told (1) that there is a different standard for accountants than attorneys, (2) that counsel for the PGE committee didn't perceive a problem, (3) that there would be different teams handling each of the cases, (4) that it was highly unlikely that there would be any disagreement over the underlying numbers (ie, that PW would at the same time be supporting and challenging numbers in claims litigation).   We've asked PW for assurances that if there is any challenge, it will be available to support the participants' position.   We're waiting for a response.   For the moment, no second choice has been identified.Before the interviews, I spoke with Marc Cohen.   He's frustrated with Joe Eisenberg.   Joe has been slow in generating a stipulation to transfer litigation responsibility to the participants committee.   Consequently, Cohen went ahead and drafted a stipulation himself.   Evidently Eisenberg is about to sign off, and the matter will be presented to the court presumably on shortened time.   I took the opportunity to urge Cohen to press Eisenberg to prepare a liquidating plan.   In that regard, Eisenberg did go to the creditors committee and propose using $4 million of the $20 million of available cash to support a plan.   Not surprisingly, the creditors came back asking for $18 million.   Cohen's sense is that there may be a deal in the $10 million range, particularly if we can persuade the trade that the participants may themselves have a claim against the $20 million.   Cohen is giving thought to how we make that case.   If we can agree on a number, we can get rid of the trade creditors, shift responsibility for the wind up to a liquidating agent of our choosing and close the bankruptcy case.Cohen apparently has made no headway in efforts to reconstitute the PGE committee.   He's concerned that the second largest creditor does not have a seat at the table and questions whether the presence of such entities as Enron and Dynegy adequately represents the interests of the broad range of Power Exchange participants.   Wearing our CPX committee hat and the duty that comes with that, are we comfortable leaving things as they are rather than encouraging our counsel to pursue the matter with some formal motion in the PGE case?   Unless I hear to the contrary, I'll assume that our position in that regard has not changed and that if there were a committee vote on that particular issue, we'd abstain.I see that some efforts may be underway to compel the Power Exchange to release collateral.   Is that something we'd consider joining?

The following is a brief=\r=20\routline of an EPMI/EEES answer to the complaint.   The answer is due Friday. =\r=20\rPlease send me any comments ASAP.=20\r ? The complaint should be rejected because it wrongly assumes that the=20\rCommission has no option to ensure just and reasonable rates but to require=\r=20\rcost based rates because there is no low cost solution to the problems=20\rcurrently faced by the California markets.   We should attach our white pape=\rr=20\rto our protest and state that the paper explains how these problems could b=\re=20\rsolved at little or no cost to the customers. =20\r? I list here, for your information, the reasons CMUA claims that markets a=\rre=20\rnot competitive (these reasons will not be re-listed in the pleading).=20\r? 2000 prices greatly exceeded 1999 prices without regard to load.\r? zonal constrained prices, even in the off-peak hours, do not reflect=20\rcompetitive outcomes for low load conditions. =20\r? even small players can be price setters\r? The changes required are additional generation, transmission, and demand=\r=20\rresponse and will cost tens of millions of dollars and take lengthy periods=\r=20\rof time to implement.\r? There is no evidence that markets will ensure just and reasonable rates i=\rn=20\rthe near future.\r? CMUA asserts that with the advent of electric restructuring, the Commissi=\ron=20\rhas increasingly allowed energy and ancillary services to be sold at=20\rmarket-based rates.   However, CMUA is wrong in the context of the West wher=\re=20\rthere has been market-based trading of electricity before electric=20\rrestructuring, since the FERC approved the Western Systems Power Pool=01,s=\r=20\rcontract in 19991.   The Commission=01,s rules didn=01,t create the wholesale=\r market=20\rin the past, the market did and it was running fine until it was messed up =\rby=20\rcertain market rules were imposed that are enumerated in our paper.   The=20\rproblem is not the market-based rates.   The problem is the market rules.\r? CMUA=01,s motion does not address how market-based rates would be calcula=\rted=20\rfor marketers that do not sell power from their own resources, let alone=20\rreflect the trading of basis points.   Almost all of the power EPMI sells is=\r=20\rpower it has bought from some other marketer or generator.   Many of EPMI=01=\r,s=20\rdeals are done through brokers such that EPMI does not find out the identit=\ry=20\rof the seller until after a deal has been struck.   Accordingly, EPMI gets n=\ro=20\rinformation about the cost of the underlying generation.=20\r? If FERC doesn=01,t try to fix the market but simply takes away our=20\rmarket-based rates, since there=01,s is no basis for us to set cost based r=\rates,=20\rwe would go out of business.   Besides there=01,s no reason to take away our=\r=20\rmarket-based rates because we are not exercising market power.   So if FERC=\r=20\rcould fix the problem with a less onerous solution (as we=01,ve proposed in=\r our=20\rwhite paper), requiring cost-based rates would constitute a regulatory taki=\rng=20\rof our business and we would have to be compensated using the constitutiona=\rl=20\rstandard.=20\r CMUA does not provide any expert testimony to support its position.   Rathe=\rr,=20\rits evidence is =01&amp;drawn from materials prepared and testimony delivered b=\ry the=20\rCalifornia ISO and other public sources.=018   Beyond the difficult evidenti=\rary=20\rissue posed by the fact that CMUA cannot swear to the veracity of informati=\ron=20\rproduced by third parties, EPMI would have no opportunity to conduct=20\rdiscovery or cross-examine of such =01&amp;witnesses.=018=20\r\n"

I am under some pressure   to explain two things:   (i) whether the fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of thing,ie. is this some kind of \"illegality\" issue?

ENA (Van Scoyk auto incident of 2/9/000)Richard - -This matter is riddled with insurance law and employment law issues.   If the independent contractor is deemed to be an employee under Wyoming law, then our insurance may come into play.   However, this has more significant implications under the employment arena.   A very valid argument exists if he is deemed to have been   an employee, then employment benefits may be due and owing.   I am somewhat familiar with these issues as I dealt with a similar issue for Enron Oil &amp; Gas many years ago.Who should I visit with regarding employment related issues?   Furthermore, if we have \"independent contractors\" driving their personal automobiles in discharging their duties, if they do not procure the correct insurance we will be facing this issue in the future. More specifically, when an individual places auto insurance they must tell the insurer that they are driving in their vehicle for business purposes, otherwise the insurer will deny coverage on these grounds. This is one of the issues that we are facing here.   I await your response.- - EWK\n"

Not to do so could have looked suspicious especially   when it is highly unlikely that their will be anything in the analysis document to show our coal to be more problematic than anyone else's.   As I said this morning, all fumes from coal fires are toxic and prolonged exposure will cause headaches, sickness etc...   This is not a function of the coal quality but of the combustion of the coal causing toxic gases. Consequently Mark Patten is concerned that Corus are not open to criticism for inadequate safety procedures and is trying to protect their own position.

VE is editing \"the Exchange Offer\", is coordinating edits to \"Regulation\" with the original ENE drafters of the section.   ECP is responsible for drafting/editing the remainder of the document.We discussed a number of relevant issues:Is this document a \"post effective amendment\" to the original S-4 filed 12/15 given that we will not be registering additional securities.   VE is going to follow up with our examiner at the exchange to determine if we still have an Edgar filing number.   I suspect the answer is no.   VE is also going to discuss our approach with the examiner to give him the heads up on what we are doing.Is disclosure of the recap required?   After conversation with Doug Bland we came to the conclusion that no disclosure was required.   This was based on the facts that 1). no agreement has been entered into.   There is not a term sheet etc.   2).   We will need lender consent.There will be disclosure of the Infineum litigation.   See below for draft language.   Please forward any comments to me.Timing:Monday evening - turn changes though the F pages Monday evening.Mon/Tues - AA begins SAS 71 review Late Tuesday - distribute document (w/o F pages) for preliminary internal review. Licato, Evans, Stappenbeck, Keevill, Plants, Mellencamp, LydeckerThursday/Friday - Turn F pagesInfineum LitigationOn June 30, 2000, Infineum USA L.P. filed an action against us in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking an unspecified amount of actual and punitive damages relating to our steam sale agreements with Infineum and Bayway Refining.   Infineum's petition claims that our existing energy services agreement with Tosco and the related amendment to the steam sale agreement with Bayway, interferes with Infineum's ability to sell to Bayway steam that Infineum purchases from our Linden facility.   Infineum calims that such interference is in violation of federal and New Jersey antitrust laws, is in breach of our agreement with Infineum and tortiously interferes with Infineum's economic relationships with Bayway.   We believe the claims made in this litigation are without merit and we intend to defend these actions vigorously.   Although no assurances can be given, we believe that the ultimate resolution of this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. Please let me know if you have any comments on the above.\n"

It is my understanding that the City of Palo Alto hasagreed that in the event that Enron and the City of Palo Alto become adversein any proceeding, then agree that our firm will have to withdraw fromrepresentation of the City of Palo Alto and that we will be able to continueto represent Enron notwithstanding the fact that they will have provided toour firm confidential information.   In particular, if Enron and the City ofPalo Alto become adverse in connection with the California electricitylitigation   (including class actions, governmental investigations and therecent decision of Enron Energy Services to transfer customers back to PG&amp;Efor physical delivery), our firm will be able to continue to represent Enroneven against the City of Palo Alto. One of the reasons that the City of PaloAlto is willing to do this is that they do not believe that it is likelythey will become adverse to Enron and their desire to have the specializedexpertise of Larry Engel.   The City of Palo Alto has its own generationcapacity through WAPA (the Western Area Power Administration), NCPA (theNorthern California Power Agency), and TANC (the Transmission Authority ofNorthern California).   The City does buy a small amount of power from Enron,as I understand it.   We have specifically identified the City and County ofSan Francisco suit and asked if Palo Alto has any intention of joining thatsuit. Would you please let us know Enron's view of this proposedbankruptcy representation in view of these disclosures?ThanksGary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

(\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Inc. (\"EES\"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland General\")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.   Webelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission tocommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced tolitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions ofpages of documents.   We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchangeof October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that bycooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entitieshave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoeverand that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise orother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in thefuture, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documentsthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney workproduct privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:   Generally speaking, the documents andinformation that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, withinEPMI, EES and Portland General.   To the extent that EEMC or EESO arerelevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be locatedwithin EES.   Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions fromeither EEMC or EESO.]GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.   The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 19998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called \"family trees\" to show itscurrent organization.   To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called \"family trees\" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.   One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.   If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.   With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.   We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 111 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.   EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It isintended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financialinformation regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to itsinvestigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financialdata on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in thesecond wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are limited in number and there will probably be limiteddocuments available.   The Enron Entities to the extent they act as ascheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generationoutput, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generationunit requested.   The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do havedocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las VegasCogeneration.   We propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions.   For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.   As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.   In addition, thosetransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California arelimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two smallCalifornia municipal utilities.   Thus, the Commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO andPX.   Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.   [We propose thatthe Commission defer requesting production of other information until it hasreviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion oftheir energy into the California market.   At that time a more accurateassessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuablegiven the limited impact of Portland General generation on the Californiawholesale market.][Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous PortlandGeneral generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be madeavailable in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling offacilities.   If there are specific documents that the Commission would likecopied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producingthese documents.   We propose to make these documents available in Portlandin a third wave of document productions]TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction datafor year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or asale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it ispossible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.   For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI'scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.   EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far morelimited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of theCommission investigation.   However, EES can also provide similar electronicTransaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specificnames of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customernumber.   This additional restriction is important to EES because many ofEES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of anysubpoena and provided an opportunity to object.   EES cannot meet your timeframe to release information and give its customers the notice they require.Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity ofretail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of thewholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retailcustomers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.   Weanticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of documentproductions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.   We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.   It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.   In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.

Cogen, et al.; Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO.This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cogen Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.   Cogen Technologies Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complaint in the Atkinson matter in mid April.   I forwarded the matter to El Paso Energy Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effective late February 20001.   El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter &amp; English to represent Cogen's interests.   We have worked with Ed in other Cogen matters before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.   This matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.   David Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respect to this incident.   We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to determine if any such obligations exist.The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and to Compel Inspection.   This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Cogen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state court as Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection of the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.   I have asked Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI Linden or NEPCO.   To date, we have not.   However, I expect that service of process is in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for it.   As this new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am forwarding a copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process and investigate the claim in your usual manner. Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to begin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.   Thanks.   Bonnie J.

As I indicated, and as Richard Sanders mentioned in the earlier conference call today, I am taking the lead in dealing with Sen Dunn on behalf of Enron. Please send to my attention the transcripts of the prior hearings and any videotapes. I will make sure they get copied and distributed to everyone who needs them.

I'll also see if Steve Levitsky, our antitrust litigator who has been working on the Infineum case, can attend as well.   Based on your planned arrival into LaGuardia around 12:15 p.m. or so, I'll assume a late lunch in the 1:000/1:15 p.m. range.   I also have assumed that we will meet at our NYC office at 125 W. 555th St. (just off of 6th Ave., between 6th and 7th Avenues)---19th Floor.   If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me know.On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late last week.   The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill &amp; Knowlton who, according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is very well known in CA Democratic circles.   He has been assisting us in certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks to facilitate anything for you in that respect.I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.   I hope that all is well.Best regards.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

The request, from Jane, is that they would like to first see if we canresolve this without the need to incur more legal fees and that a delay of a fewweeks to allow that process to continue will not prejudice either party.

Keith suggested that Jason and Phil speak directly to Larry Hamilton about this subject, and they will attempt to do that soon.   (2)   Mitigation Duty ---   They are not comfortable w/ a duty to mitigate Replacement Cost damages that are calculated by TVA b/c they cannot foresee circumstances where any action or failure to act could have any impact on those damages.   We explained that we wanted the Distributors to have every incentive to cooperate w/ us in keeping those damages minimized.   They might be willing to concede on this point if we can work out everything else.   (3)   EPMI's Cover Damages ---   They are not very comfortable agreeing to the concept that a Distributor would have to pay damages to EPMI b/c they cannot imagine how they could be responsible for failing to receive an \"into\" product such as this.   We both agreed to reconsider this.(4)   Criteria for Enron's rejection of Distributor --- Our right to approve Distributors is ok, but they want to add language to prevent EPMI from being arbitrary about those approvals.   We agreed.(5)   Notice of changes to underlying agreements --- Their duty to notify us it ok, but they want to add language that is in line w/ their Distributor agreements, which don't absolutely require Distributors to tell TEPAC everything.   We agreed.(6)   Request for offers ---   They would prefer that EPMI call them every day w/ quotes (which is how Williams does it now), rather than having to initiate the process.   We described this as our normal way of doing business and they agreed.(7)   Indemnity clause --- We struck a sentence about each party indemnifying the other while they have title to the power, which had been included in our earlier draft.   I agreed to look into this.   (8)   Governing Law and Arbitration --- TEPAC is ok w/ NY law, but would prefer including a clause requiring EPMI to sue TEPAC or any distributor in Tennessee (even tho Keith thinks that would be the legal result anyway).   They would also prefer to have the arbitration situs in Tennessee.   We both agreed to reconsider this.   Richard:   What do you think about that?Any comments are welcome.Regards,JaniceEB3861Assistant General Counsel, Enron North America Corp.713-853-1794 (Fax:   713-646-4842)\n"

Steve has offered to keep Carolyn, and if we come just the night, I might do   that. ???It is just a hard decision to make. ?She is still so young.

Easter sounds good to us. ?There was a chance that Maury's sister was   coming...but they just found out they owe alot in Taxes...so cancelled. ?We   will probably go on down on Thursday night since we are off on Good Friday. ? There is a big event in San Antonio that I plan to take the kids to. ?I think   it will be at 1:000...so we will plan to be gone on that day. ?Which will give   some breathing room for whoever is there. ?There is this huge egg hunt at the   Episcopal Diosese...which is where Maury's mom works...and I hear it is   better than any country club egg hunt. ?Just fun. ?So we will go there and   come back for the night.

In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from   the court. The writ was issued to enforce an judgment   for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,   and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or assets.   The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors. Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may impose penalties for violations   of its garnishment order.We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control teams on   this matter ASAP. JWVS\n"

In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from   the court. The writ was issued to enforce an judgment   for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,   and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or assets.   The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors. Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may impose penalties for violations   of its garnishment order.We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control teams on   this matter ASAP. JWVS\n"

The opposing counsel quickly reverted to personal attacks against Bill, which did not go over well. Union's main point was that the judge wrongly applied La. law. Two of the justices expressed doubts about Union's argument. I personally think the choice of law argument is a weak argument for Union. The remainder of the time was spent analizing a particular provisition of the gas purchase agreement between Union and the utility district. In short, you didn't miss much.\n"

Before the start of the hearing, we met outside the courtroom with Vinmar's lawyers.   They apparently finally came to the conclusion that the arbitration agreement covers this discovery dispute, and, after some discussion, they agreed to pass the hearing.   We will work with them to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator this week, if possible, and they can have this issue heard before the arbitrator.   This morning they mentioned three former judges as potential arbitrators: Ruby Sondock, Alvin Zimmerman, and Susan Soussan, although I think their preference out of those three would be Alvin Zimmerman.   He would also be my preference out of those choices.   They may send us other names that they would consider using as an arbitrator, but, in the meantime, let me know what you think about these three.   Thanks.\n"

In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from   the court. The writ was issued to enforce an judgment   for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,   and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or assets.   The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors. Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may impose penalties for violations   of its garnishment order.We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control teams on   this matter ASAP. JWVS\n"

I sent by faxto you all relevant documents I have concerning any South American detailswhich have Ecogas involvement.   As stated over the phone and set out in thedocuments, I have never had any ownership interest in any corporation,partnership, joint-venture, etc. for South America relating to Ecogas.   Thedocuments which you suggest you have cannot represent any such interest asit does not and never has existed.   I simply would not act in that mannerand would have expected you to hold that understanding.Given the status of Ecogas' operations currently I want to suggest that weall direct our total efforts to resolution of that crisis, rather thancontinuing personal distractions and devisiveness.Regards,Jerrel\n"

Gilles himself is a member of the New York bar.I asked Gilles to send you information concerning his firm directly.   Gilles tells me that he is going to be in Texas on business sometime soon.

Julie has held her tongue because of her impending 8 weeks in Austin this summer. The kids are great. Lots of sibling rivalries goingI have been biking with Garribaldi and Worscheh in preparation for our participation in the Houston to Austin bike tour. Garribaldi has a new job with a couple of big projects in the pipeline. Worscheh finally got his financing on his project so he is pretty chipper these days. They are pregnant again and out of space in their house. Missy Medary is running for District Court Judge in Corpus Christi. She is running as a Republican in a Democratic stronghold and her last name is not Perez or Medarcia so her chances are slim. She is hoping for a George W. Bush coattail effect. Tom was not all that keen on the idea the last time I talked to him. Don't quote me on this but I think he is worried that she is a status seeker and that she will have way too much of what she wants if she is elected( Judges tend to have a lot of people kissing their ass) Rob and Amy are just holding on with their 4 kids. I think Rob's job is going well: they made one large aquisition at the bottom of the market and commodity prices have doubled. I haven't seen anyone else,although I did talk to John Scott the other day. He works for a firm in Dallas that does alot of Enron's work. I laughed at him when he told me he is trying to get his kids into Country Day. He was always calling it Country Gay. Tell Kinga I said hi if you are still...er...dating?\n"

I spoke with the company president today.   He believes that they do not have any exposure but would like to settle the matter as they believe it will cost them more than $5000 to hire counsel to defend it.   I told him that I did not believe that HPL would be inclined to pay $5000 to settle the case, but that I would pass along his request.   I am concerned about his statement in the letter re having given HPL notice over a year ago to remove the pipe/valve.   I asked him if he had any correspondence or other evidence of that .   He will check and get back to us.   Lisa Robichaux will determine whether our right of way group has anything in its file placing us on notice that we no longer had the right to be on the land.   If we received notice and ignored it, we may want to consider contributing to a settlement since they would have at least some evidence to attempt to prove intentional trespass.   However, I still believe that Collins will have a difficult time proving any actual damages.   We need to be cautious about not getting into a situation in which Durango/IP Petroleum would end up helping Collins to prove his case.   Eileen Kisluk will be working on this matter in my absence over the next two weeks.   We just received notice that the case was set for trial on August 17.   Plaintiff had not done any discovery before setting it for trial.   He sent out requests for disclosure and a few interrogatories/requests for production along with the notice of trial setting.   Lisa Robichaux will work with John Towles in Right of Way to gather the information.   We also intend to send out a notice of deposition of Collins for the week I return (July24).   In the meantime, if you agree, I intend to file a motion for continuance since Durango would like one, Collins did not give us notice of his request for trial setting and I will be out due to wedding/honeymoon.   However, we will be prepared to go forward in the event that it is not granted.   I will be in the office until approximately noon tomorrow if you have any questions.   Thanks.Bonnie ---"

He believes that they do not have any exposure but would like to settle the matter as they believe it will cost them more than $5000 to hire counsel to defend it.   I told him that I did not believe that HPL would be inclined to pay $5000 to settle the case, but that I would pass along his request.   I am concerned about his statement in the letter re having given HPL notice over a year ago to remove the pipe/valve.   I asked him if he had any correspondence or other evidence of that .   He will check and get back to us.   Lisa Robichaux will determine whether our right of way group has anything in its file placing us on notice that we no longer had the right to be on the land.   If we received notice and ignored it, we may want to consider contributing to a settlement since they would have at least some evidence to attempt to prove intentional trespass.   However, I still believe that Collins will have a difficult time proving any actual damages.   We need to be cautious about not getting into a situation in which Durango/IP Petroleum would end up helping Collins to prove his case.   Eileen Kisluk will be working on this matter in my absence over the next two weeks.   We just received notice that the case was set for trial on August 17.   Plaintiff had not done any discovery before setting it for trial.   He sent out requests for disclosure and a few interrogatories/requests for production along with the notice of trial setting.   Lisa Robichaux will work with John Towles in Right of Way to gather the information.   We also intend to send out a notice of deposition of Collins for the week I return (July24).   In the meantime, if you agree, I intend to file a motion for continuance since Durango would like one, Collins did not give us notice of his request for trial setting and I will be out due to wedding/honeymoon.   However, we will be prepared to go forward in the event that it is not granted.   I will be in the office until approximately noon tomorrow if you have any questions.   Thanks.Bonnie ---"

I'm not sure what to make of this in light of the upcoming change in the Administration, but I thought you would want to be aware of it.   Also, although the focus appears to be generators, I would assume that if DOJ elected to go forward andy investigation would be likely to expand to include major marketers.   JohnFriday December 15, 1:03 pm Eastern TimeJustice Dept Asked to Probe Power CrisisWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno has been asked to investigate whether possible collusion and other illegal activities among power generators are behind the huge jump in California's electricity and natural gas prices.```We are concerned that market power is being abused by generators in the electricity market to inflate prices and gouge consumers,''' California Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and California State Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton said in a letter to Reno late on Thursday.```We request that the Department of Justice investigate potential collusion and any other unlawful acts by generators in the electricity market,''' they added.They noted in the letter that one-fourth of the state's generating plants --- representing 111,000 megawatts of power --- were shut down last weekend, allegedly for repairs or routine maintenance, when California citizens faced rolling blackouts.```Some have suggested that one reason for plant shutdowns is that in some cases companies are selling natural gas they would otherwise use to operate their plants at exorbitant prices on the natural gas market,''' they said.If true, Boxer and Burton said it would explain some of the electricity shortage problems and raise concern about irregular activity in the natural gas market.In a related action, they sent letters to power company executives asking them to explain why their firms shut down generators while California faced power shortages.Wholesale electricity prices in the state have soared as high as $1,4000 per megawatt hour.Boxer and Burton admitted time is running out for Reno to take action since a new attorney general will take the helm of the Justice Department when Republican George W. Bush assumes the presidency in late January.```However, this crisis in upon us now,''' they said. ```I hope you will take immediate steps to address this matter, thereby setting a strong example of leadership for the new attorney general to follow.'''\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

Two of FERC's five positions (both Republican or Independent) are vacant, but soon to be filled by nominated candidates.   Both nominees (Pat Wood and Nora Brownell) are expected to be helpful to our interests.   If we suceed in getting a U.S. district court judge to sollicit FERC's view befor the   two new nominees are seated, there may be a slight risk that members of Congress will hold their nominations hostage over the issue of how FERC answers the court.I have copied Linda Robertson, the head of Enron's Washington shop, so that she can assess how real this risk is and whether it should influence our timing.\n"

(\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Inc. (\"EES\"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland General\")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.   Webelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission tocommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced tolitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions ofpages of documents.   We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchangeof October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that bycooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entitieshave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoeverand that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise orother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in thefuture, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documentsthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney workproduct privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:   Generally speaking, the documents andinformation that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, withinEPMI, EES and Portland General.   To the extent that EEMC or EESO arerelevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be locatedwithin EES.   Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions fromeither EEMC or EESO.]GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.   The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 19998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called \"family trees\" to show itscurrent organization.   To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called \"family trees\" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.   One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.   If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.   With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.   We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 111 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.   EPMI, EES, and Portland Generalwill provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for thepurchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It isintended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financialinformation regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to itsinvestigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financialdata on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in thesecond wave of document productions.GENERATING DOCUMENTSRequests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generationfacilities are limited in number and there will probably be limiteddocuments available.   The Enron Entities to the extent they act as ascheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generationoutput, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generationunit requested.   The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do havedocuments and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las VegasCogeneration.   We propose to produce these documents in the second wave ofdocument productions.   For Portland General, the production of the requested documentswould involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General ownedtwenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about onehalf of its total energy demand.   As a result, we question whether theeffort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on theCalifornia wholesale market is necessarily limited.   In addition, thosetransactions which do involve Portland General sales into California arelimited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two smallCalifornia municipal utilities.   Thus, the Commission will receive theessential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO andPX.   Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data beingprovided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.   [We propose thatthe Commission defer requesting production of other information until it hasreviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion oftheir energy into the California market.   At that time a more accurateassessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuablegiven the limited impact of Portland General generation on the Californiawholesale market.][Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous PortlandGeneral generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be madeavailable in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling offacilities.   If there are specific documents that the Commission would likecopied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producingthese documents.   We propose to make these documents available in Portlandin a third wave of document productions]TRANSACTION DOCUMENTSRequests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction datafor year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) forthe purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or asale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it ispossible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.   For thosetransactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, weunderstand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there willnot be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI'scustomer on an accounting system rather than as part of the tradingbusiness.   EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far morelimited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of theCommission investigation.   However, EES can also provide similar electronicTransaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specificnames of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customernumber.   This additional restriction is important to EES because many ofEES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of anysubpoena and provided an opportunity to object.   EES cannot meet your timeframe to release information and give its customers the notice they require.Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity ofretail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of thewholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retailcustomers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.   Weanticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of documentproductions.FERC DOCUMENTSRequest 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they receivedfrom FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies ofthose responses.   We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various EnronEntities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions onFriday October 27, 2000.   It is possible that not all Enron Entities couldmake that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available forproduction by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that ifany entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currentlyin place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will beprotected by the most stringent protective order.   In addition, if, at therequest of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or acourt of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production belimited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right tolimit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us knowif they are acceptable to the Commission.

(\"EPMI\"), Enron Energy Services Inc. (\"EES\"), Enron EnergyMarketing Corporation (\"EEMC\"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)and Portland General Electric Corporation (\"Portland General\")(collectivelysometimes referred to as the \"Enron Entities\")Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued bythe California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter \"the Commission\").The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking itsinvestigation into the problems in the California electric markets byproducing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.   Webelieve that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission tocommence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced tolitigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions ofpages of documents.   We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchangeof October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that bycooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entitieshave not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoeverand that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise orother responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in thefuture, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documentsthat are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney workproduct privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:   Generally speaking, the documents andinformation that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, withinEPMI, EES and Portland General.   To the extent that EEMC or EESO arerelevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be locatedwithin EES.   Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions fromeither EEMC or EESO.]GENERAL DOCUMENTSRequests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations havingacquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganizedthemselves extensively during the past two years.   The burden and expense onEnron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywherein its organization since April 1, 19998 is significant.   The Enron entitieswill provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizationalcharts, telephone directories and so called \"family trees\" to show itscurrent organization.   To the extent that Enron can readily identify andlocate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directoriesor so called \"family trees\" for earlier periods it will also make thoseavailable.   One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on itscorporate history.   If a list of those books would be helpful, we canprovide it.   With respect to the other entities, to the extent thatcorporate histories can be found, they will be produced.   We anticipateproducing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 willidentify their relationship to affiliated companies and the TransactionDocuments will identify its customers and suppliers.FINANCIAL DOCUMENTSRequests 7 through 111 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the periodrequested with respect to financial data.

I am sending it separately to Susan Rossi, in-house counsel for the PX.? Since our last conference call we've discussed the various forums and pending actions with FERC counsel for Reliant and Enron. My understanding is that the PX wants us to act and will cooperate with us.? Marc, I haven't circulated this to the whole group because I wanted to go through you.? What is the appropriate next step??? A call with the decisionmakers on this issue so that we can make a plan to move forward??? Can we do that Monday or Tuesday?I've set out Reliant's conclusions here.? 1. There is no forum other than California state court in which we can get compensation for the commandeered contracts because of the Eleventh Amendment issue.2. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with the FERC proceeding in Tucson Electric. 3. Filing the inverse condemnation action is not inconsistent with Duke v. Davis or with any other proceeding anyone may want to bring alleging that the commandeering itself was illegal (e.g. on preemption grounds).4.? As we discussed, nobody (including PG&amp;E and SCE) wants the Board of Control to be deciding anything if we can avoid it.? We would suggest going along with the PX's suggestion that the bankruptcy court should be staying the Board of Control action because of the interventions of SCE and PG&amp;E, who are taking the position that the compensation should go to them.? Then, we can go forward with the inverse condemnation action in state court (we picked LA as the forum because LA residents are less affected by the energy crisis than most others in the state, and because it's convenient). If PG&amp;E and SCE are permitted to intervene in the state court action, we can stipulate to relief from stay so that it can go forward.? This way, the Board of Control is effectively stayed while the state court action goes forward.5.? Richard Sanders expressed the very real concern that we don't want SCE and PG&amp;E's defenses to liquidation of the block forward contracts to be decided anywhere but FERC.? We think we should be able to avoid that: since SCE and PG&amp;E have already put the issue squarely before FERC, that defense could be stayed under the primary jurisdiction doctrine pending FERC's decision.? We would argue that the whole case need not be stayed in the meantime, since the governor's duty to compensate holds no matter who is owed the compensation, and any proceeds from PX contracts will be funneled into the Moreno escrow account.6.? As we also discussed, we can file this complaint in the name of the PX, Reliant, and any other market participants who want to be plaintiffs (we just need names and a few facts to allege for each plaintiff). Or, as someone suggested, if the PX Market Participants Committee is an entity that has standing, it could be filed in that name along with the PX.? Either way, the prayer for relief asks that all funds be deposited in the Moreno escrow account for disposition consistent with FERC's decision in Coral Power.?   - 213155587_2.DOC\n"

HPL was sued as to only one plaintiff, Larry Don Williams.   I called to get info on why HPL was sued and alleged dates of exposure.   Wert advised me that HPL was added as a plaintiff because Larry Don Williams was allegedly exposed to asbestos while working for Thomas Construction Company at an HPL facility in Berkclair, Texas, during 1963 and 1964.   He also told me that Williams was allegedly exposed at a Houston Natural Gas Pipeline facility in Victoria, Texas, during 1970-72.   (We have not yet been served as to Houston Natural Gas Pipeline.)   Wert did not have information in his database as to Williams' employer during that time period.Rob, as we have previously discussed, I assume that you will check to determine what policies of insurance might cover claims for those time periods.Our answer date on this matter is next Monday, March 26, but plaintiffs' counsel has said that we can have a couple of extra weeks if we would like.   I will send him a Rule 111 agreement to secure the extra time, so that we can investigate insurance coverage further. \n"

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,9990 megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times as much as a year ago. Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these \"gaming\" tactics contributed to the plants' deteriorating condition. \"We suspected it,\" said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the ISO. \"It was a sure factor in driving up prices.\" Such swings in unit output, he said, \"would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units up.\" Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's headquarters in Houston. According to the accounts of three plant operators, Reliant's operations schedulers on the energy trading floor ordered them to repeatedly decrease, then increase output at the 1,046-megawatt Etiwanda plant. This happened as many as four or five times an hour. Each time the units were ramped down and electricity production fell, plant employees watched on a control room computer screen as spot market energy prices rose. Then came the phone call to ramp the units back up. \"They would tell us what to do, and we would do it,\" said one of the men, who only agreed to speak on condition they not be identified because they fear being fired. \"Afterward, we would just sit there and watch the market change.\" The workers said frequent and large swings in electricity output began at a number of California power plants just as the state's power crisis began in earnest. The workers and state power authorities assert the swings were one of the primary means of gaming the wholesale energy market. \"It appears the control rooms are responsive to direction from the trading floors in Houston, rather than the reliability needs of the ISO,\" said Carl Wood, a commissioner with the utilities commission who is overseeing that agency's investigation into plant outages. \"Instead of being responsive to demands for reliability, they're responsive to demands for profitability.\" Corporate denial Reliant officials adamantly deny using this tactic or any other mechanism to game the California energy market. They and other power companies, including AES Corp. and a partnership between NRG Energy Inc. and Dynegy Inc., have asserted that skyrocketing electricity demand forced them to run aging, decrepit power plants harder than ever to meet California's needs. While acknowledging that the company issued changes in output levels as frequently as every 10 minutes, company officials said it was done at the instructions of the ISO to maintain supply-demand balance. \"As a part of routinely doing business within California and the California market design, we are required to do that,\" said Kevin Frankeny, an operations official with Reliant. \"When the ISO (issues dispatch orders), they dispatch on a 10-minute basis. It can go up and down many times within an hour.\" Frankeny said he was not aware of any instances in which Reliant schedulers in Houston ordered dispatch changes without the ISO directing them to do it first. The ISO refused to comment on operations at any specific facility, but Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman, said the ramping tactics were used beyond dispatch instructions during periods of tight supply. And one of the plant operators said the orders to vary output came independently of the grid managers. \"ISO was not calling Reliant every 10 minutes for that,\" said one of the operators. \"Not for an individual unit.\" Officials with the California attorney general's office declined to comment on the legality of the ramping practice, citing a continuing investigation into whether wholesale energy prices are being manipulated. One source familiar with the state of various inquiries said the ramping, if proved to have been done to drive up prices, could violate the state's unfair business practices laws. Invisible practice How could companies such as Reliant tinker with output and not get caught? One of the plant workers said the practice was designed to be virtually invisible to regulators and grid operators. When power companies bid on hourly contracts, they agree to produce a certain amount of electricity over the given hour. Generators are paid based on an average of the spot market prices for that hour. By driving up the spot price, they can increase their hourly profits and still produce the total amount of energy required. The plant worker said the units would be ramped down immediately after their output measurement, which was performed at the top of each hour by the ISO. Then, he said, it was brought back up as the spot market price of electricity rose in response to the reduced output. By the time the ISO measured again, the output was back at the expected level. Another operator said the units were not always ramped up and down - that if the price reached a satisfactory level, generators would raise output and remain at that level as long as the price was right. Other times, if the price was low, output was brought down and kept down. The same operator said the amount of ramping appeared to be a matter of individual will of the company schedulers in Houston, with some being more aggressive than others. \"What they would do, especially late at night, is if the price tanked, they would undergenerate,\" an operator said. \"Then, mysteriously, the price would go up. \"Then, if the schedule was at 70 (required megawatt hours of output), they'd say, 'Go up to 90.' That would cause the price to tank. And they'd say, 'Bring it down again.' \" Rapid changes These fluctuations occurred within time spans of as little as 10 to 15 minutes, the operators said. But acceptable rates for bringing a unit from minimum to maximum levels when the plant was owned by Southern California Edison were more like 80 minutes, to avoid stressing the machinery, one of the workers said. Moreover, they were typically run at constant levels, which also reduced wear and tear. \"They were basically ramping up as fast as they can, and then slamming the brakes on,\" said one of the operators. \"They were increasing the fatigue on the units.\" ISO officials say they changed market operations last fall to crack down on gaming tactics, including instituting a so-called 10-minute market, rather than the hourly market, so that it could be more easily detected when companies were withholding power. But the ISO says generator outages have now become the primary tactic in driving up energy prices. A computer analysis by The Chronicle of shutdown data over a recent 39-day period shows Reliant and three other generating companies topped the list of plant shutdowns. Reliant also represented the largest amount of wattage lost among those companies. Plants owned by Reliant, AES, Mirant Corp. and Duke Energy Inc. accounted for more than half of the state's unplanned shutdowns, even though their generating capacity was no more than 25 percent of the state's total capacity from all sources. Reliant, one of California's largest and most profitable out-of-state generators, reported 319 shutdowns during the period in March and April. It was followed by Mirant Corp. of Atlanta (310), AES Corp. of Arlington, Va. (278) and Duke Energy North America of Charlotte, N.C. (261). Reliant's unplanned shutdowns deprived the system of more than 53,000 megawatts over the 40-day period, an average of 1,368 per day - enough power for 1.4 million homes for one hour. Its Ormond Beach plant in Oxnard, with one generating unit down for 26 days, accounted for more than 30,000 of those missed megawatts. However, an operator who worked in that plant said the outages there appeared to be the result of legitimate equipment failures. Reliant says there are valid reasons for its plants now to be in need of repair. They are old: At 48, Etiwanda is the oldest of Reliant's five California plants. And the company says routine maintenance was deferred so the plants could remain in service during times of high summer demand. But the operators said the issue is not so clear-cut. One problem at Etiwanda, a tube leak, had been present for about a month and was previously reported to management, they said, but it had not deteriorated much, it was operating at full capacity and there was no immediate need to take the unit offline because of the problem. Moreover, at the time of the shutdown, the ISO had expressly asked Reliant to keep the unit online, the operators said. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant, denied that any Reliant unit was taken offline for unnecessary maintenance. Ramping may be rampant Sources say Reliant was not alone in using the ramping practice. A source familiar with the state utilities commission investigation said output logs obtained from AES' Alamitos plant also reflected production fluctuations. And an operator who has worked at the El Segundo plant co-owned by NRG and Dynegy said the practice was used there, although less frequently. The scheduling calls came from Dynegy's trading floor in Houston, rather than NRG in Minneapolis, he said. Steve Stengel, a spokesman for Dynegy, said changes in output at El Segundo were a normal function of changing demand levels throughout the day, and denied the company was engaged in gaming the California market. In a May 2000 report, the California Energy Commission cited Reliant's Etiwanda plant, as well as the Alamitos and El Segundo plants, as some of the \"major beneficiaries of high real-time prices\" that spring. One way to obtain those high prices, the plant workers said, was the simple method of demanding a sky-high price and refusing to deliver power if that price was not met. On one occasion, one operator said, Reliant ordered a unit at Etiwanda to be shut off because the ISO would not meet the price of $1,000 per megawatt hour, even though the legal price cap at the time was $750. \"The operator said, 'It's our unit, shut it off,' \" the source said.

You and Laura might want to use this paragraph in your response to all his other business-related arguments.   (I might add, for the record and as a point for the future, that we can easily get into this kind of trouble when we don't take care to obtain signed Statements of Work before the work starts.)Here it is:Mr. Schlosser, your letter states that the ePower Locator, GeoQual, Hamachi, and Mountain Top applications are SGSI's intellectual property because the parties do not have an executed Statement of Work.   This argument is incorrect.   Both parties are bound by the fully executed professional services contract, which clearly states in Article 17 that all material developed by Consultant (SGSI) \"shall become the property of Company (EBS) when prepared.\"   Because the work, whether or not covered in a written Statement of Work, was requested by EBS and performed by SGSI (subject to EBS' concerns about such performance),   the work is clearly covered by the Professional Services Contract, and the foregoing statement of ownership applies.   Accordingly, EBS respectfully refuses your requests concerning such work.Eric and Laura, I would be happy to look at the balance of the letter, once you've written it.   You have my permission to go hard on these folks, if their work was poor and there was no EBS authorization for them to run up such high charges.Kenton\n"

Milbank has a depth of project experience on project construction and equipment suppliers and their agreements.   I would propose the West Coast office and allow Ed Feo to select the appropriate personnel.While I beleive that Milbank is not the only firm that can perform this engagement adequately, I do believe that they could be timely and cost efficient on a issue as largely commercial issue as this.   Please let me know your view as we need to resolve our options, and ultimately our course of action next week.Chuck Ward \n"

Rose=20\rUNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER=20\rOctober 18, 2000=20\r A power company executive yesterday boiled California's ongoing electricity=\r=20\rcrisis down to the bottom line.=20\r \"Prices are rising, and I know that's hurting consumers =01) but it certain=\rly=20\rhas been beneficial for Enron,\" said Jeffrey Skilling,=20\rpresident and chief operating officer of the Houston-based energy and tradi=\rng=20\rcompany.   Enron declined to specify how=20\rmuch it earned from California during the past summer, when the state's=20\rderegulated electricity market sent power prices=20\rsoaring. But the Texas company did say that profits of its sales and servic=\res=20\runit =01) which trades California electricity and o\rther commodities =01) increased 135 percent to $404 million.=20\r Dynegy Inc., also based in Houston, reported that income from its marketing=\r=20\rand trade unit soared more than 3000 percent to $142 million.   Steve\rBergstrom, president of Dynegy, said California was perhaps only the=20\rthird-biggest contributor to that surge. But industry analysts said the=20\rearnings\r reports are the first indication of a pattern expected in coming weeks.=20\r \"California clearly drove the positive momentum at both of these companies,=\r\"=20\rsaid Carol Coale, senior analyst of Prudential=20\rSecurities. \"And you probably just saw the beginning of a string of strong=\r=20\rreports (from the power industry).\"   She and others=20\rsay they suspect that power companies derived billions in profits from the=\r=20\rstate, where tight supplies set the stage for huge price increases.=20\r Companies did not necessarily have to own generating plants to profit from=\r=20\rthe deregulated market. Enron produces no electricity in California=20\rbut is the nation's largest electricity trader, buying and selling the outp=\rut=20\rof power plants owned by other companies.=20\r Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, said the big profits should be seen in=20\rsomething other than a business context.   \"These massive profits=20\rby the energy companies translate directly into thousands of San Diegans=20\rlosing savings that were planned for education, mortgage=20\rpayments, health care and other . . . necessities,\" Hunter said.=20\r When the state power exchange saw dramatic price increases within a matter =\rof=20\rhours, \"it was clear that predatory pricing was producing=20\rmassive profits for someone,\" Hunter said.   Hunter insists that recent powe=\rr=20\rprices violate federal law mandating that rates be \"just and reasonable.\"=\r=20\rHe is calling for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to order refunds=\r.=20\rFERC is scheduled to issue a report on the California market by Nov. 1.=20\r The political fallout from the price increases, meanwhile, appears to weigh=\r=20\rheavily on power companies, which are reluctant to tout successes in=20\rCalifornia for fear of being singled out for profiteering.=20\r After noting that Dynegy's recent acquisitions in Illinois contributed=20\rstrongly to the company's success last quarter, Bergstrom was reminded that=\r=20\rhe=20\rhad omitted mention of California.=20\r \"Illinois is not as politically volatile as California,\" Bergstrom said.=20\r He acknowledged that Dynegy did \"pretty well\" in California because its pow=\rer=20\rplants produced far more electricity this year than last. Bergstrom=20\ralso sought to correct an earlier report that Dynegy had quickly recouped t=\rhe=20\rcost of power plants it recently acquired in the state.=20\r He said that was true only of the plants it owns in Long Beach and El=20\rSegundo, which it bought in 19998. Bergstrom said the cost of Dynegy's half=\r=20\rinterest=20\rin the former San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Encina power plant in Carlsbad =01)=\r=20\racquired at the end of 19998 =01) had not been recovered.=20\r Typically, plant operators assume that it will take as long as 20 years to=\r=20\rrecoup such costs.=20\r In comments to financial analysts, Skilling, of Enron, suggested that power=\r=20\rcompanies could help provide a solution to California's power problems.=20\r \"Supply constraints and the resulting price pressures in California and oth=\rer=20\rlocations have demonstrated the need for skilled marketers like Enron=20\rto provide reliable power and stable prices,\" Skilling said.   He predicted=\r=20\rthat California's utility companies =01) which now buy much of their power =\rfrom=20\rother companies =01) would sign long-term contracts to stabilize prices,=20\rfollowing an approach suggested by many power generators and traders.=20\r \"If they were willing to extend the terms of their purchases to 10-year=20\rcontracts, then they could get contracts for $50 a megawatt, which is not=\r=20\rmuch=20\rdifferent than they were paying two or three years ago,\" Skilling said.=20\r But consumer advocates have noted that long-term contracts at those levels=\r=20\rwould lock consumers into price increases and leave them with little=20\rchoice about suppliers. Advocates of electrical deregulation had predicted=\r=20\rthat introducing competition would lead to reductions in power costs=20\rand to greater consumer choice.=20\r Harry Snyder, senior advocate for Consumers Union in San Francisco, said he=\r=20\rwas skeptical of solutions proposed by the power industry.=20\r \"Any proposal from the industry has to be suspect because they have engaged=\r=20\rin faking out the California public and price gouging when there=20\rare shortages,\" said Snyder, who advocates an end to deregulation.=20\r \"They do not have consumer interests at heart.\"\r =20\r=20\r   \n"

The last response I heardfrom Blakes was over a month ago, when they said they would remindEnron.   Then, about three weeks ago, I was asked by an attorney in SanFrancisco to assist him with some Enron work related to California.   Itold him that, in my experience, Enron does not pay its bills, so heoffered me an advance retainer.   He also said he had checked with theappropriate person at Enron in Houston, who said that he had justapproved payment of my invoice.   But that was over three weeks ago and Istill have seen nothing.My letter agreement is with Blakes, not Enron, so I had assumed thatBlakes would pay me and invoice Enron themselves.   But Blakes seemsunwilling to pay me themselves and unable to get Enron to pay medirectly.   I would appreciate any assistance you can provide on thismatter.Thanks, and do have a Merry Christmas.Larryassured him that my invoice which I agreed to do when he said he wouldpay a retainer in advance. - leruff.vcf\n"

I'll also see if Steve Levitsky, our antitrust litigator who has been working on the Infineum case, can attend as well.   Based on your planned arrival into LaGuardia around 12:15 p.m. or so, I'll assume a late lunch in the 1:000/1:15 p.m. range.   I also have assumed that we will meet at our NYC office at 125 W. 555th St. (just off of 6th Ave., between 6th and 7th Avenues)---19th Floor.   If, for some reason, that does not work for you logistically, just let me know.On the California front, I'm sorry we keep missing each other, so I thought I would just relay what I found out based on an exchange of a couple of voice mails with certain of my insurance partners in our San Francisco office late last week.   The consultant we have been using on the insurance matters I described in my voice mail is Frank Mankowitz (sp?) of Hill &amp; Knowlton who, according to my partners (and which I was not aware of), was John Kennedy's press secretary and ran George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign and is very well known in CA Democratic circles.   He has been assisting us in certain negotiations with the AG's Office and my insurance partners think he has been doing a very good job. Let me know if you would like any our folks to facilitate anything for you in that respect.I look forward to catching up with you in NY next week.   I hope that all is well.Best regards.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

It is clear that this group hopes to persuade SDI and Enron tocontribute something to such a settlement, but they told Hennegan that theywould fund the full $13 million themselves if necessary.   Hennegan is askingfor something in the \"high $20s\"   I am advised that the settlement group isprepared to go to the high teens, but it is not clear how much further.I do not know the allocation of the $13 million among Natwest and McDonald,except that I believe that Natwest is NOT paying the lion's share, as onemight expect.If the bargaining proceeds, I am sure that someone will ask Enron tocontribute.   ...ALSCHULER GROSSMAN STEIN &amp; KAHAN LLPATTORNEYS AT LAWww.agsk.com2049 Century Park EastThirty-Ninth FloorLos Angeles, CA 900067-3213Tel 310-2777-12226Fax 310-5552-60777This transmission is intended only for the useof the addressee and may contain informationthat is privileged, confidential and exempt fromdisclosure under applicable law.

(E-mail)\" &lt;richard.b.sanders@enron.com&lt;\t\t\t cc: \"Meringolo, Peter\" &lt;PMeringolo@brobeck.com&lt;\t\t\t Subject: Some thoughts on optionsPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGERichard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas onoptions:1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order thatis being litigated by others.   If the protective order has not   changed,then unilaterally postpone production until it is.   Pro: Better protectionand more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitledto financial performance data.   Thus, this option does not fullydisclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later ofsimply engaging in delaying tactics.   Under this option   we file ourformal objections as well.2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data forelectricity that was delivered.   Pro: PUC will get the data   anywayeither through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouginglitigation.   By turning over the data that will show   profits, PUC mightslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business byseeking to depose witnesses etc.   Con:   This would be waiving thelegitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery thisinformation through a   subpoena.   There is also a question of howconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda.   Itmight also serve   to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enroninformation and discovery.   This option would also provide confidentialproprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitiveadvantage.3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OFDATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISOand PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give   only missingdata. PRO:   It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside ofCalifornia data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.   Con:   Without Enroncost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want --- a profit and losspicture.   We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that   thecombination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they needto calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.   Pro:   It would notreveal the profit and loss information.   Con:   It would not reveal theprofit and loss information.   In other words, the PUC is clear that this iswhat they are after.   By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit andloss.   Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PXdata, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will bequite large, but just not the cost or expense side.5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its positionfor the following reasons:   (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is   notentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latestemail, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more   data (1999)than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like thetransaction data they will come back and   ask for profit and lossinformation that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) CommissionerWood's statement that the purpose   of this investigation is to getmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigationby the AG into activities   of other market participants and the noticethat other governmental agencies are cooperating --- who are we producingthis   information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors publicdisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required todo so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other marketparticipants are not involved in the process BPA etc.   PRO:   Thismay be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of thePUC to get this data.   Moreover, in the   current politicalenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.   Italso makes sense to see what FERC   will do with their published 111/1/000report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formalobjections and sit back and   wait.6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the othermarket participants.   We will not produce until the protective order   ismodified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.   PRO:   Thismakes it look like all the market participants are   acting in concertand really is no different than option 1 above.   Moreover, if you readReliant's responses, they appear ready to   turn over financial data ifthe protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of theiroffices today.)   Note that   Williams is adopting a strategy that saysthe PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.   This may bemet with   strong opposition by the PUC given their Californiaconstitutional contempt authority.7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why thePUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits   before theALJ.   PRO:   The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.   Ithas the least procedural risks of being   dismissed.   CON:   Readingthe tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that thePUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally grantedcontempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike   Day) thatthey need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.   They will also takethe view that the Superior Court has no   jurisdiction   to hear ourappeal.   Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable atthe Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of ourobjections might be at the ALJ level.8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal PowerAct and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUCissued its subpoena in part.   The dispute to be decided is whether the PUChas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and   loss information from thewholesale market.   The authority for this would be Mississippi Power &amp; Lightv. Mississippi   487 US   354 (bright line between wholesale market regulatedby FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 19994)(federal question whether stateagency can inquire into business and financial data   in the wholesalemarket but found no cognizable claim.)   PRO:   The federal forum may be moreeven handed than the ALJ, but   the question is whether we can state acognizable claim.   There may be greater protections from disclosure of theinformation as   well.   CON:   The PUC may continue on a parallel track unlesswe are able to obtain injunctive relief.   The PUC might seek   discovery ofthe same information in the Federal court proceeding.   We should assume thatthis action will trigger the strongest   response from the PUC and/or the AGin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the sameinformation (e.g   unfair business practice suit, price gouging,anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for tradersetc.   By taking   this position, we will clearly be conceding that ifFERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for PortlandGeneral, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from   thoseentities.   PRO:   The information provided for these entities is not likelyto generate profit and loss information that would be   germane to the fightwe are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates forexample.)   For Portland General,   Dave Aamodt is out of the office andnot able to participate in any change of direction discussions.Hope this is helpful.ThanksGary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

        " Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT on 12/01/2000 07:56 AM ---\t\"Fergus, Gary S.\" &lt;GFergus@brobeck.com&lt;\t10/24/2000 04:45 PM \t\t\t To: \"Richard B. Sanders Esq. (E-mail)\" &lt;richard.b.sanders@enron.com&lt;\t\t\t cc: \"Meringolo, Peter\" &lt;PMeringolo@brobeck.com&lt;\t\t\t Subject: Some thoughts on optionsPRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIALATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGERichard, After today's discussion here are our brainstorming ideas onoptions:1.   WAIT FOR A BETTER PROTECTIVE ORDER Ask Harvey Morris where they are on fixing the protective order thatis being litigated by others.   If the protective order has not   changed,then unilaterally postpone production until it is.   Pro: Better protectionand more time; Con: Even with a more stringent protective order Enron still questions whether the PUC is entitledto financial performance data.   Thus, this option does not fullydisclose all of Enron's positions and the company may be accused later ofsimply engaging in delaying tactics.   Under this option   we file ourformal objections as well.2. TURN OVER THE TRANSACTION DATA AS IS Continue on our present course of turning over transaction data forelectricity that was delivered.   Pro: PUC will get the data   anywayeither through FERC, unfair competition, antitrust or price gouginglitigation.   By turning over the data that will show   profits, PUC mightslow down investigation there as opposed to interrupting the business byseeking to depose witnesses etc.   Con:   This would be waiving thelegitimate question that Enron has as to the PUC's ability to discovery thisinformation through a   subpoena.   There is also a question of howconfidential this data would be given the current political agenda.   Itmight also serve   to whet the appetite of the PUC for more Enroninformation and discovery.   This option would also provide confidentialproprietary information to the PUC about how Enron gets its competitiveadvantage.3. TURN OVER DATA FOR OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AND LET PUC GET REST OFDATA FROM ISO AND PX. We have told the PUC we do not want to duplicate the efforts of ISOand PX so the way to relieve the burden on us is to give   only missingdata. PRO:   It would be easier and quicker to just give the outside ofCalifornia data and would sidestep for the moment the ongoing jurisdictional question.   Con:   Without Enroncost data for the California ISO and PX transactions, the PUC would not be able to arrive at what they want --- a profit and losspicture.   We would have a hard time representing to the PUC that   thecombination of the PUC data and the Enron data would be all that they needto calculate the answers to Request Nos. 7-10.4. TURN OVER EVERYTHING BUT PRICE This option would simple omit the price data.   Pro:   It would notreveal the profit and loss information.   Con:   It would not reveal theprofit and loss information.   In other words, the PUC is clear that this iswhat they are after.   By giving them everything else, we would in effect be telling them we will not turn over profit andloss.   Moreover, by piecing some of it together with the ISO and PXdata, the PUC might be able to put together a revenue picture which will bequite large, but just not the cost or expense side.5. DECLINE TO PRODUCE THE DATA We would tell Harvey Morris that Enron has reconsidered its positionfor the following reasons:   (1) Our firm belief that the PUC is   notentitled to the profit and loss data they are seeking; (2) in his latestemail, Harvey has made it clear that the PUC wants more   data (1999)than we discussed earlier; (3) continued threat that if they do not like thetransaction data they will come back and   ask for profit and lossinformation that we do not believe they are entitled to; (4) CommissionerWood's statement that the purpose   of this investigation is to getmoney from market participants in the hands of consumers; (5) investigationby the AG into activities   of other market participants and the noticethat other governmental agencies are cooperating --- who are we producingthis   information to and for what purpose; (6) Enron favors publicdisclosure of trading data but only if all participants are required todo so; (7) Enron is a small player in this market and many other marketparticipants are not involved in the process BPA etc.   PRO:   Thismay be the only way to preserve Enron's challenge to the jurisdiction of thePUC to get this data.   Moreover, in the   current politicalenvironment there is no assurance where this information will be leaked.   Italso makes sense to see what FERC   will do with their published 111/1/000report on investigation date. Under this option, we file our formalobjections and sit back and   wait.6. ME TOO Upon reflection, we agree with the approach taken by the othermarket participants.   We will not produce until the protective order   ismodified and then only data that is within the PUC jurisdiction.   PRO:   Thismakes it look like all the market participants are   acting in concertand really is no different than option 1 above.   Moreover, if you readReliant's responses, they appear ready to   turn over financial data ifthe protective order is modified. (Terry and Mike Day are both out of theiroffices today.)   Note that   Williams is adopting a strategy that saysthe PUC needs to go to Superior Court to enforce its subpoena.   This may bemet with   strong opposition by the PUC given their Californiaconstitutional contempt authority.7. MOVE TO QUASH BEFORE THE ALJ Here we would raise all of the arguments that we have about why thePUC does not have jurisdiction and fight it out on the merits   before theALJ.   PRO:   The ALJ is a forum to raise the jurisdictional questions.   Ithas the least procedural risks of being   dismissed.   CON:   Readingthe tea leaves, we believe it unlikely that the ALJ will determine that thePUC has no jurisdiction. Moreover, because the PUC has its own constitutionally grantedcontempt power, the PUC will take the view (according to Mike   Day) thatthey need not go to the Superior Court for enforcement.   They will also takethe view that the Superior Court has no   jurisdiction   to hear ourappeal.   Appeals have to go to the PUC and those orders are appealable atthe Court of Appeal level.   Thus, the only de novo review of ourobjections might be at the ALJ level.8. FILE DECLARATORY RELIEF ACTION IN FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA We would claim federal question jurisdiction under the Federal PowerAct and in particular the provisions of 824(g) under which the PUCissued its subpoena in part.   The dispute to be decided is whether the PUChas the jurisdiction to seek the profit and   loss information from thewholesale market.   The authority for this would be Mississippi Power &amp; Lightv. Mississippi   487 US   354 (bright line between wholesale market regulatedby FERC and the retail market regulated by states); Bristol Energy Corp v.New Hampshire 13 F.3d 471 (1st Cir. 19994)(federal question whether stateagency can inquire into business and financial data   in the wholesalemarket but found no cognizable claim.)   PRO:   The federal forum may be moreeven handed than the ALJ, but   the question is whether we can state acognizable claim.   There may be greater protections from disclosure of theinformation as   well.   CON:   The PUC may continue on a parallel track unlesswe are able to obtain injunctive relief.   The PUC might seek   discovery ofthe same information in the Federal court proceeding.   We should assume thatthis action will trigger the strongest   response from the PUC and/or the AGin form of further investigations or alternative forums for getting the sameinformation (e.g   unfair business practice suit, price gouging,anti-trust etc.).   We should anticipate deposition requests for tradersetc.   By taking   this position, we will clearly be conceding that ifFERC asks for the data it is germane to their authority.9. SEPARATE RESPONSES/STRATEGIES FOR DIFFERENT ENRON ENTITIES It may make some sense to chart a different course for PortlandGeneral, EES and EEMC and continue to produce some data from   thoseentities.   PRO:   The information provided for these entities is not likelyto generate profit and loss information that would be   germane to the fightwe are about to engage in (e.g. EES's description of % off tariff rates forexample.)

Southern California Gas Company. Class action anti-trust andunfair competition.   This is a conspiracy case alleging that the SouthernCalifornia Gas, SDGE and El Paso   conspired not to compete in thedelivery of natural gas in Southern California.   The   complaint allegesthat the conspiracy resulted in discouraging new power plants and droveup the cost of electricity by controlling the supply of gas. &lt;&lt;Berg Gas Complaint.pdf&lt;&lt;Copy of Rojoin Electricity Complaint I do not believe I include a copy of this complaint before.   It is aclass action involving the retail electrical market. &lt;&lt;Rojoin.cmplt.PDF&lt;&lt;California AG Investigation Here is a copy of my email to the California AG describing ouragreement re preservation of data:Rich, As promised, here is my summary outline of what we discussedregarding preservation of data:1. In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to thetopics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to deleteany email sent or received for 24 hours.   Email that is personal and doesnot relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept, discardedetc. at the employee's pleasure.   Each day there is a backup made that willcapture the email in those employees mailboxes.   After 24 hours, eachemployee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to thebusiness needs (e.g. keep, discard).   From our conversation, I understandthat you agree that this is an acceptable procedure.2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you wouldlike to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us todiscuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuestDrive Image Pro 4.0.   In addition, there may be some other individuals thatyou would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to copyfiles from their hard drives onto the network.   Until we figure out whichcomputers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.   We discussed thatbecause of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this starteduntil after the new year.3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup alongbusiness function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of yourrequest.   We propose not to backup any other business units or functions.On a going forward basis, those business functions that related to thesubject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete businessemail.4. We believe that relevant database   backups have been and willcontinue to be made and preserved.5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, itis an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the network(where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files to makesufficient work space for the employee to work.6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we donot have as detailed information immediately available.As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being madeare done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron entities mayhave to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction, relevance,privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically reserves each andevery right and objection it or its employees may have.Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation isdifferent than the above.CPUC Subpoena Jeff Richter and Tim Belden have been working on getting the EPMIdata correctly gathered.   They hope that by the middle of next week theEnron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and haveassembled it for production.   Because Jeff Richter will be gone until afterthe New Year, we will not be producing any data to the CPUC until early nextyear. Jeff and Tim are focused on having a common set of reliable datathat will be used for all subpoenas, discovery requests etc.   We alsodiscussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts tohelp with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records forwhich we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time.   In otherwords, since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in Portland anyanalytical work that Tim or Jeff do for us will be recorded on the backuptapes.Tim Belden FYI Tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due dateof December 25th.   He will become out of pocket for a short time thereafter.FERC Reporting A question arose regarding whether Enron needed to file a report toFERC concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps.   This was arequirement that was requested by the ISO in an emergency application onDecember 8th.   The order granting the relief did not seem to include thereporting requirement.   The first cut at the data for the report showed thatEnron made $1.0M over a weekend by buying power at $5000 and selling at $7000.A later cut at the data came up with a different answer.   When consulted byChristian Yoder and Steve Hall, I made the unilateral decision not to filethe report.   It was unclear whether we needed to do so and I had not seenand did not trust the data.   Later Dan Watkiss confirmed that he believed wedid not need to file the report.   However, beginning January 12th thisreport will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap.   Since this reportrequires a breakdown of costs vs. sales price, it is the same data that thePUC has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in thelitigation.   Tim Belden and Jeff Richter are working on a standard reportingmethod.Hiring of Chief Operating Officer for ISO Tim Belden has been approached by the current Chief Operatingofficer of the ISO requesting a job.   Apparently the COO and the current ISOboard are not getting along.   The issue raised by Tim to Mark Haedicke andRichard was whether they saw a problem with this hire.   One of the keyissues would be what was the business purpose for the hire.   Obviously,Enron does not want confidential ISO information from this person.   Also, ifthis person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if histestimony would be favorable to Enron it would be viewed as purchased.   Onthe other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he wasemployed by Enron that could be harmful.   There is also the question raisedwhether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motivescould be in play.   Tim will be meeting with the COO on Friday.   He hasinstructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data andthat no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation team.Potential for Criminal Investigation The news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raisedquestions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk ofpersonal liability for them (civil or criminal).   I reported that all weknow is that there is an investigation under way by the California AttorneyGeneral.   We have no reason to believe right now that they are focused onEnron or that Enron or any employee is a target.   I said that at this stageof the investigation (including our investigation) we do not know enoughfacts to evaluate the risk for individual employees.   We have not reviewedthe trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes.   If we learn offacts that are specific to an employee, Mark has asked that we notify himimmediately.   We did provide some of this same information to traders weinterviewed early in the process.Analysis of EPMI data I have taken a look at the deviation of the ISO energy flow on adaily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations toEPMI's.   The source of the data is public information that was available todecision makers at the time.   The comparison shows that generally speakingthe ISO was short in its projection by a magnitude of 5-10 times the amountthat EPMI was out of balance.   There are some exceptions, but those arerare.Approaching Federal Judge for More Time Dave Noonan has pointed out that we should look carefully at theassigned federal judge and decide who from the defense group locally in SanDiego would be in the best position to make the motion.Holiday Contact List Dave Noonan suggested and I concurred that it makes sense for all ofyou who receive this report to email me with your contact information andschedule over the holiday period.   I will have a composite list made up anddistributed.ThanksGary===This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

State and ISO v. Reliant et al.Richard, Per Gary's request, here is the status of Duke Energy v. GovernorDavis and ISO v. Reliant.Duke v. State of California. According to a news article, on February 27, 20001, Duke Energy Corp.suspended its lawsuit against Gray Davis and the State \"after the CaliforniaDepartment of Water Resources agreed to buy power from Duke that wasformerly being provided under contracts with two financially troubleutilities.\" Originally, Duke argued that Governor Davis exceeded his authorityunder the Emergency Services Act when he commandeered Duke's long-termcontracts. The case is suspended until an April 30 hearing.   I am trying toobtain a copy of any order and/or stipulation filed with the Court.ISO v. Reliant, et al. I.   Brief Summary of Complaint In ISO v. Reliant, et al., ISO seeks a preliminary injunction torequire six Reliant entities, Williams Energy Marketing &amp; Trading, four AESentities, and Dynegy Power Corporation (collectively, \"Defendants\") toprovide generation in response to ISO's emergency dispatch instructions. ISO's sole allegation is that because Defendants submitted to theISO Tariff by participating in the ISO markets and by entering intoScheduling Coordinator Agreements and Participating Generator Agreements,Defendants cannot refuse to generate in response to an emergency dispatchorder.   This allegation is based upon section 5.6.1 of the Tariff. II.   Current Status of the Case --- February 23, 20001 StipulationOn February 23, 20001, the parties entered a stipulation, which states, inrelevant part:   The Reliant Defendants, Williams, and Dynegy(collectively \"Generator Defendants\") will comply with emergency dispatchorders of the California ISO under the terms of the ISO tariff withoutregard to whether ISO allocates the cost of power produced in response tosuch a dispatch order to a creditworthy Scheduling Coorindator until theearlier of the following:   (a) 5:000 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on March 19,20001, or   (b) two business days (but in no event less than 48hours) after written notice to this Court and the parties by a GeneratorDefendant that this stipulated obligation is terminated as to it.   3. Notice of termination by a Generator Defendant ofits obligation under paragraph 2(b) shall not affect the stipulatedobligations or remaining Generator Defendants except that, on receipt ofsuch notice, each remaining Generator Defendant shall have the right to filewith the Court an election terminating its obligation. In the event of suchan election, the obligation of a terminating Generator Defendant to complywith ISO dispatch orders imposed by paragraph 2 shall end 48 hours afterwritten notice to ISO of the election to terminate. Each terminatingGenerator Defendant shall have the same right and status to participate inany legal proceedings that follow the initial notice of termination,including any appeal.   4. The motions heard by this Court on February 16,20001, including ISO's motion for preliminary injunction, Reliant's motion todismiss or stay pursuant to the FERC order, and DWR's motion to dismissReliant's third party complaint, will be deemed submitted at 5:000 p.m. onMarch 16, 20001, or at 5:000 p.m. on the day written notice of termination ofthe obligation stipulated in paragraph 2 is filed with the Court, whicheveris earlier. II.   February 16th Hearing Below is a summary of the hearing held on February 16th in theReliant case, which I initially prepared on Saturday, February 17th.   Iapologize if you did not receive this earlier.&lt;   The hearing involved three motions:&lt;&lt;   (A) ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction&lt;   (B) Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or Stay&lt;   (C) DWR's Motion to Dismiss Third Party Complaint&lt;&lt;   Judge Damrell took each motion under submission and stated that he&lt; will issue an order on or before February 21, 20001 at 5:000 p.m.   He&lt; ordered the February 8, 20001 TRO to remain in effect until then.   Judge&lt; Damrell clarified that the TRO requires Defendants to respond to all ISO&lt; Emergency Dispatch Orders (\"EDOs\") regardless of the creditworthiness of&lt; the purchasers.   The Judge encouraged Defendants to stipulate that they&lt; would respond to ISO EDOs, and gave Defendants until February 20, 20001 to&lt; do so.   (It appears that only AES is willing to do so at this time).&lt;Summary&lt;   ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Reliant's Motion to&lt; Dismiss/ Stay are linked in that they essentially relate to the same&lt; issue:   Are generators obligated to respond to EDOs despite having no&lt; assurances that they will be paid, i.e., assurances that a creditworthy&lt; purchaser will be buying the generation in response to the EDO?&lt;&lt;   A.   Reliant's Motion to Dismiss or to Stay&lt;&lt;   Reliant's motion to dismiss or alternatively to stay was based&lt; solely upon a February 14, 20001 FERC order conditionally adopting ISO's&lt; proposed Amendment 36.   This FERC Order (as I understand it from the&lt; arguments) allows ISO to waive the creditworthy requirement only with&lt; respect to PG&amp;E and SCE scheduling of energy to meet their own load.&lt;&lt;   Parsing the Order, Reliant argued that the Order implicitly means&lt; that the creditworthy requirement is not waived with respect to all other&lt; purchases, including EDOs.   Because of the FERC Order, Reliant argued that&lt; ISO's complaint, which seeks injunctive relief requiring Defendants to&lt; respond to EDOs without assurances of creditworthiness, should be&lt; dismissed.   Alternatively, Reliant argued that because the proceeding&lt; before FERC continues, the Court should stay this case pending the outcome&lt; by FERC.&lt;&lt;   ISO argued that according to the language of the FERC Order, FERC&lt; explicitly did not rule on the issue related to the application of the&lt; creditworthiness requirement to EDOs.   And, a stay is improper because due&lt; to energy crisis, ISO cannot wait for FERC to decide this issue.&lt;&lt;   Analysis:   Judge Damrell appeared very skeptical of Reliant's&lt; interpretation of the Order.   He asked, \"If FERC intended that the&lt; creditworthy requirements apply to EDO, why didn't it address it head-on,&lt; especially because the importance of this issue was raised by Dynegy&lt; before FERC?\"   He questioned Reliant about several sentences in the Order&lt; which suggest that FERC explicitly did not decide the issue.&lt;&lt;   Judge Damrell is unlikely to stay the proceedings.   He stated that&lt; the exigencies of the situation are such that he perhaps he should not&lt; wait for FERC to rule.   He made several comments about how long it takes&lt; FERC to act, and that the Federal Courts should step in times of crisis&lt; such as this.&lt;&lt;   B.   ISO's Motion for Preliminary Injunction&lt;&lt;   In support of its motion for a preliminary injunction to require&lt; Defendants to provide generation in response to EDOs, ISO argued as&lt; follows: (1) Defendants submitted to the ISO Tariff by participating in&lt; the ISO markets and by entering into Scheduling Coordinator Agreements and&lt; Participating Generator Agreements; (2) Section 5.6.1 of the Tariff&lt; obligates Defendants to respond to EDOs; (3) EDOs are essential to \"keep&lt; the lights on;\" and (4) because the decision to issue EDOs are made only&lt; in times of emergencies, the ISO does not look at who the purchaser is, is&lt; not required to by the Tariff, and should not be required to because of&lt; the current energy crisis.&lt;&lt;   Defendants argued that they need not respond to an EDO without&lt; assurances that they would be selling to a creditworthy purchaser because&lt; (1) the creditworthy requirement is an essential element of the Tariff;&lt; and (2) a 2/14/01 FERC Order held that the creditworthy requirement&lt; applies even EDOs.&lt;&lt;   Dynegy raised an additional argument --- ISO and DWR are using the&lt; EDO procedures to get a price below market and that there is no real&lt; threat that the lights will go out.   According to Dynegy, DWR can back&lt; real time purchases including EDOs, but instead DWR backs only purchases&lt; at a certain price below market.   If generators refuse, ISO issues an EDO,&lt; with no assurances that the generators will get paid, as a strong arm&lt; tactic to get this below market price.   Dynegy argued that the reality is&lt; that the lights will not go out because if generators do not abide by the&lt; EDOs, DWR has enough money to buy at market rate.   There would be no issue&lt; here if DWR would pay the just and reasonable rate for the electricity,&lt; rather than using EDO procedures to lower the rate.   And, DWR can go to&lt; FERC if it believes that the rate is unjust and unreasonable.&lt;&lt;   Analysis:   Judge Damrell certainly appeared to be leaning towards&lt; the ISO.   He expressed his views that this case involves a narrow issue ---&lt; do the Defendants have an obligation to respond to EDO's without&lt; assurances that it will get paid in this time of crisis.   His questions&lt; and comments suggest that he believes that the amount of energy subject to&lt; the EDO's is small and necessary to avert rolling black-outs.   He&lt; questioned Mr. Detmer, manager of operation of ISO, who suggested that&lt; about 5% of purchases at peak are made through EDOs.&lt;&lt;   Judge Damrell was not very sympathetic towards Dynegy's argument,&lt; asking \"Are you was saying that DWR, ISO and the State are the cause of&lt; the crisis?\"   Several times, Judge Damrell stated that he thought the high&lt; wholesale prices caused the crisis.   According to Judge Damrell, \"the&lt; simple fact is, you got rich, and the utilities went broke.\"   Also, as&lt; noted above, Judge Damrell does not believe that waiting for FERC to make&lt; decisions is the proper course in the current energy crisis because FERC&lt; does not act quickly enough.&lt;&lt;   C.   DWR's Motion to Dismiss 3rd Party Complaint Reliant brought a third party complaint against DWR, and DWR movedto dismiss.   As framed by the Court, the key issue is:   does 111th Amendmentprohibit Reliant from joining DWR in the case?   Judge Damrell asked aboutthe 111th Amendment immunity argument, stating that the issue was notthoroughly briefed.   The Judge asked the parties to file supplemental briefson the issue. I am obtaining a copy of these supplemental briefs and I willsummarize DWR's argument in a subsequent email.&lt; Peter P.

While too much should never be read into a grant of certiorari, this seems to be auspicious for Enron and to validate Joe's conclusion that it would be imprudent for Enron to rest on its victory in the court of appeals and not oppose proactively New York, et al. who are asking the Court to expand the native load exception.   It should also be noted that the broadside against FERC's authority to act (the Dalton cert. petition), which Enron took the lead in opposing, was rejected outright.   Enron's brief is due in 45 days.   Joe and I shall meet with Lou early next week to get this process started.

The bureau obtained a search warrant in May, claiming the twocompanies co-ordinated bids last year to drive up prices onAlberta's central electricity exchange, the paper said. BothPowerex and Enron Canada Corp. said charges haven't been laid, anddenied they had broken any laws.   Competition Bureau officials didn't say whether theinvestigation is continuing. Unnamed sources told the paper thebureau ```is keeping an eye on''' electricity markets in BritishColumbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate.   On Nov. 16, Houston-based Enron, the world's biggest energytrader, said it plans to sell a 15 percent stake in a key Indianpower project valued at $136 million.   Powerex is the power-marketing subsidiary of the BritishColumbia Hydro and Power Authority.(Globe and Mail, B1, 111/23)Report on Business: Canadian Competition cops raided power firms Evidence of electricity price fixing sought in Enron , Powerex offices, warrant shows LILY NGUYEN AND PETER KENNEDY ? 111/23/2000 The Globe and Mail Metro Page B1 All material copyright Thomson Canada Limited or its licensors. All rights reserved. The offices of Enron Canada Corp. and Powerex Corp. were raided this year by the federal Competition Bureau, which was investigating suspected price fixing by the two companies. In a search warrant application last May, the bureau alleged that in the summer of 1999, Enron and Powerex co-ordinated bids to drive up the price of electricity on the Power Pool of Alberta, the province's central electricity exchange, Dow Jones reported. Both companies confirmed searches were carried out, but said no charges have been laid and denied breaking any laws. Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron Corp. in Houston, which owns Calgary-based Enron Canada, said the bureau has since returned all of Enron 's files. Mr. Thode added the bureau has called Enron only once with a question about the files. \"It remains just allegations,\" he said. \"We are confident that all of our activities have been in the rules of the Power Pool of Alberta and within applicable Canadian laws.\" Both he and Wayne Cousins, a spokesman for Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority,said they didn't know if their companies are still being investigated. \"Powerex is confident that the bureau's investigation will find that the company has not violated the rules of the Alberta Power Pool,\" Mr. Cousins said. A spokesman from the Competition Bureau was not immediately available to confirm whether the investigation is continuing, but sources close to the bureau said it has been keeping an eye on the electricity markets in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario as those provinces deregulate. While most of the bureau's monitoring has been in the form of advice, the regulator has taken steps for more direct intervention, sources said. Deregulation of the electricity market is still new and the market is not established, giving companies in the sector ample opportunity to play with the system, sources said. According to the search warrant, the bureau began investigating the two companies when Power Pool of Alberta system controllers noticed the price for a megawatt of electricity frequently rose above $1000. In the Alberta system, participants submit bids to buy or sell power for the following day, and the price per megawatt of power is set by the most expensive unit needed to meet demand. Until the Power Pool changed its rules on Oct. 20, 1999, a participant could change the amount of power it bid or offered up until 20 minutes before the hour of transmission. The search warrant covers the companies' actions from June 1, 1999, to Oct. 19, 1999. Mr. Thode said investigations of this nature are common in deregulating markets. \"It's happened in California this year, it's happened in the Midwest, it's happened around the globe. It's not unusual to see this type of investigation occur,\" he said. He added the Power Pool is required to call in the federal agency whenever there are allegations.

In the writ, the court very unambiguously and very plainly commands that EECC is not to pay any debt or deliver any property to CIGSA pending further orders from   the court. The writ was issued to enforce an judgment   for $1.3 million awarded by the court against CIGSA in favor of Richard P Estrada. EECC is also commanded to appear before the court and list all funds/assets in our possession that might belong to CIGSA,   and to disclose what other persons we know ofif any, that might have such funds or assets.   The lawyer for Mr. Estrada is the same lawyer who successfully garnished EECC in the past to collect sums owed other CIGSA judgment creditors. Please take this prohibition as applying even to cases where CIGSA might be entitled to the money or the property under our contracts with them, or where the funds or property are in joint venture acounts or custody in the US or Mexico until we have had a chance to review matters in detail and make a more accurate assessment. In the meantime, effective immediately, do not make ANY payments to or on behalf of, or release ANY property to or on behalf of, any CIGSA entity without first obtaining legal department approval. The court may impose penalties for violations   of its garnishment order.We will assemble an appropriate litigation team to work onthis matter. Randy Pais will be handling this for EEOS legal. I suggest that Mike Pearson and Mark Brand get the word out to the Project Management and Project Control teams on   this matter ASAP. JWVS\n"

I told him we were considering it, but Enron did not want to encourage anyone else to sue Enron by showing a willingness to pay money just to get out of a lawsuit.? Tom replied that he thought that there was virtually no chance that anyone else would sue Enron now.? Since Hatch's clients have appeared to be the most likely prospects for still suing Enron, this was a very encouraging conversation.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman James Hoecker Thursday asked Congress to give the commission new authority to order refunds in the event of electricity price gouging. Hoecker sought the retroactive ratemaking authority in the context of the commission's investigation of power market volatility in California this summer, where prices for San Diego consumers have more than doubled from last year. Congress should give FERC \"authority to retroactively correct extraordinary wealth transfers that can happen when prices unexpectedly skyrocket and consumers cannot get out of the way,\" Hoecker told the House Government Reform Committee. The commission, in response to a petition from San Diego Gas&amp;Electric Co., a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), has ordered a staff investigation of the market situation in California. FERC will order refunds if it determines that power producers have obtained \"unjust or unreasonable\" prices for the power they sold into California electricity markets overseen by the state's power exchange and independent system operator, Hoecker said. But under the Federal Power Act, FERC can't order any refunds beyond the Aug. 23 date of its order setting the investigation, the nation's chief energy regulator noted. \"We do not now have that authority,\" he said. \"The commission staff is hard at work on completing its fact-finding investigation. Based on the staff report to the commission, we will be prepared to take further measures, as appropriate,\" Hoecker testified. \"The commission expects its actions and the measures adopted by the state will moderate price volatility in California markets,\" he said.

We have received 5 complaints from the vibrations resulting from operation of Units #1 and #2. I have personally been to each individuals residence since this morning to monitor for the vibrations and to listen to the individuals. In all, every person just feels a little frustrated by the problem, I have not ran across anyone that has been unfriendly. Below I will list the individual complaints and my findings visiting their residence.Karen Ellis - Most likely the cause of most of the complaints, they are the closest to the facility and have the most vibration from the units. While I was at their residence I could feel the windows rattle, and at some points feel the walls vibrate. There is a definite vibration present at this residence.Mr &amp; Mrs. King - They called and complained but were unavailable to visit their residence, they live in the same vacinity as Karen Ellis.Lynda Stout - Very next house after Karen Ellis, stopped and visited with her and Richard Black this morning, they are complaining about the vibrations but while I was there I could not determine if there were any vibrations occuring. Cannot eliminate the possibility.Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not determine if Vibrations were present or not.Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience some noise and vibration.In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the exhaust transition that they need to investigate. I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if this is possible.We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats why I want to get everyone out here if possible.Peter\n"

Cannot eliminate the possibility.Richard Black - Same as above, he seems like he may cause a little bit of trouble. While I was visiting he said that he has rental property (the trailer park) that he could not rent due to the vibrations. I could not determine if Vibrations were present or not.Clint Fuqua (something like that) - Lives in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION from all other complaints. He stopped by this morning to complain (and pick up his dog). I went to his house and visited, could not feel vibrations from his residence, I believe if the wind direction were to change he would experience some noise and vibration.In all, everyone is just wanting to know if this will be permanent or just temporary. I have explained to everyone that this will be temporary till we can obtain the proper information to find a solution. The vibrations seem to be getting worse as we run, I believe that Westinghouse has a problem in the exhaust transition that they need to investigate. I spoke with Curt Smith this morning and expressed the severity of this problem and recommended that they get someone up here tomorrow, we are trying to environmental testing out here tomorrow, I should know this afternoon if this is possible.We are also experienceing cracking in the exhaust area on the units, Westinhouse is investigating as we speak. I believe they are associated.Will keep you updated on the testing. Weare going to dispatch tomorrow, thats why I want to get everyone out here if possible.Peter\n"

We ultimately were unable to do any deal with Mr. Euell and subsequently, he publicly blamed us for his inability to complete a deal.   Attached is an article from the Wall Street Journal.   Mark Palmer, Steve Kean and I spent most of Friday trying to kill the story.   In addition to numerous conversations, we even played tapes of the final three phone calls between Mr. Euell and our trader.   While we were unable to kill the story completely, we are pleased with the outcome.   If you have any questions, please call me at ext. 3-9053.A Trio of Little GuysEmbarks on Wild RideIn Global Oil Market---Pursuing Business With DOE,Their Paths Diverge; OneLeads to `a Lot of Money' By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John Fialka in Denver, Alexei Barrionuevo in Tallahassee, Fla., and Jonathan Weil in New York ? 10/16/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A1 (Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.) Lance Stroud of New York, Renard D. Euell of Denver and Ronald Peek of Tallahassee, Fla., all had dreams of becoming oil barons. And on Oct. 4, when the Department of Energy announced the results of the bidding for oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they thought their ships had come in. Two of the three black entrepreneurs were unknowns in the industry, and none of them had ever done a major oil deal. But there they were, listed as winning bidders alongside some of the biggest names in the business --- Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &amp; Co., BP Amoco PLC and Amerada Hess Corp. Each would be given the right to withdraw millions of barrels of oil from the reserve amid one of the most volatile oil markets in decades. In exchange, each had offered to replace that oil, plus an additional amount akin to an interest payment, a year later. They and the other winning bidders, the Energy Department said, were picked soley because they pledged to return the biggest quantities of oil to the reserve. There was just one catch: In its rush to release the oil and so ease a price crunch, the Energy Department had suspended its usual requirement that each bidder supply financial guarantees. But it wanted the winning bidders to present letters of credit, equal to the oil's market value, five days after their bids were submitted. The big players could easily meet that requirement. But Messrs. Stroud, Euell and Peek were men of limited means. They needed to find someone willing to back them for tens of millions of dollars --- and fast. The drama made for an unaccustomed scene in Harlem, where the 35-year-old Mr. Stroud lived with his 74-year-old mother. A heavy-set man with a goatee, Mr. Stroud, a former Army enlisted man who had dropped out of college shy of graduation, had held a string of odd jobs while using the Internet to seek out a big business deal. The aspiring oil man had entered his bid for four million barrels from the reserve, via the Internet. He won't discuss the details of his bid, but says he thought he could outbid the large oil companies because he didn't have as much overhead. After the winning bids were announced, Mr. Stroud became something of a celebrity. TV news crews arrived to interview his neighbors, many of whom had no idea what all the fuss was about. \"I thought he [Mr. Stroud] was some kind of rap star,\" recalls Carline Thomas, who lives down the hall from him. As neighbors paused to shoot the breeze on the steps of nearby residential buildings, most marred by graffiti, Wall Street couriers bearing fat packets of information spent the week scurrying back and forth from Mr. Stroud's apartment on a seedy block in Harlem's central business district. Inside Mr. Stroud's apartment, the telephone wouldn't stop ringing, and his mother was helping him field the calls. He says he was in serious talks with four companies. And a movie producer was interested in his life story. Then, amid the chaos, tragedy struck. On Tuesday night, his mother, Iris Manning, suffered a cardiac arrest, and was taken to a hospital a few blocks south of Mr. Stroud's apartment. Mr. Stroud said he spent most of Wednesday running between his apartment and the hospital, taking occasional phone calls to deal with prospective financiers. Ms. Manning went into cardiac arrest three more times, and died at 9:47 p.m. Wednesday evening. Mr. Stroud was dazed by the fact that what he called the two biggest events of his life --- the death of his mother and his selection by the Energy Department --- occurred almost simultaneously. \"I'm saying `there must be some reason I'm here,' \" he said later. \"These things happening like this, the odds must be in the millions.\" Mr. Stroud won't discuss which companies were vying for his oil, but he says at one point he thought he had an offer to buy him out for $1.50 a barrel, or $6 million. The most serious discussions began Thursday, with a representative from a refining company, which he refuses to name. From that discussion Thursday until the following evening, Mr. Stroud says, he was confident that the refiner would grant him the letter of credit he needed. But at 9 p.m. Friday, three hours before his deadline, Mr. Stroud said he got a call telling him the deal was off. \"I was upset,\" he says. \"I mean, instead of wasting my time with that I could have obtained the financing quickly\" from some other source. A spokesman for Koch Industries Inc., based in Wichita, Kan., said it was in negotiations with both Messrs. Euell and Stroud. \"We invited them to make a deal that made economic sense.\" BP Amoco said it also had discussions with Mr. Stroud. Mr. Stroud now says the DOE should have given him an extension, under the circumstances. \"If your mother passes, aren't you given three days to grieve?\" Mr. Stroud asks. His mother's funeral is scheduled for Wednesday, which would have been her 75th birthday, he says. Mr. Euell ran a small company, Euell Energy Resources, whose 12 employees helped him broker natural-gas sales and other small energy deals. By night, he worked the phones from his home in a modest Denver suburb, calling oil producers in Nigeria and energy brokers in Singapore and Sydney, always looking for the big score that would make him rich. A friend, Norman Early, a sometime golfing partner and a former Denver U.S. district attorney, says the 50-year-old Mr. Euell is \"one of those guys who shoots for the stars.\" On Oct. 4, Mr. Euell thought he had hit one. He had been awarded the right to withdraw three million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in exchange for returning 3.3 million barrels a year later. That was enough oil to fill 14,019 conventional tank trucks. Knowing he would need a partner to provide financial backing, Mr. Euell had already placed a call to a man he'd never met: Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of Enron Corp. He said he was sure he was going to be one of the top bidders for the reserve oil. Would Enron like to be his partner? Within a few hours John Nolan, the giant energy company's vice president in charge of trading, called from London. Enron , he said, was interested. By Oct. 6, the price of oil had already fallen, making Mr. Euell's bid look generous. Still, he felt bullish. \"I'm betting on Mother Nature, that she's coming back this winter and that oil's going to be more valuable.\" It wasn't Mother Nature, but the crisis in the Middle East that turned things around. Monday, Oct. 9, the target price for November oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, jumped a dollar to $31.86 a barrel and headed higher. Mr. Euell flew to Houston and took a room at the Hyatt Regency, from which he could see Enron 's 50-story office tower. By Tuesday, the price of oil had hit $333.18. By Mr. Euell's calculations that meant a $3 million profit for him and an equal amount for his prospective partner just across the street. Enron 's lawyers were working on an agreement that would substitute Enron as the major party in Mr. Euell's contract, he said, and were drawing up the letter of credit for $93 million that the DOE required. Eager to close the deal, Mr. Euell called Enron trader Patrick Danaher, who was working on the project. \"I want to sign this thing up today,\" Mr. Euell told him, claiming that he had received an offer from another, unnamed firm, offering to buy his contract for $1.2 million. According to tapes of the conversation provided by Enron , Mr. Danaher said the paperwork was under way: \"Let me see if we can do that today.\" Mr. Euell called backed at 111:30 a.m. and again at 111:45 a.m. Each time, the trader sounded more pessimistic. Prospects were \"50-50.\" When Mr. Euell suggested he had other offers, Mr. Danaher told him: \"If you have a bid at $1.2 million, you should take it. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. I just have to tell you that.\" Still, he invited Mr. Euell to dinner. Tuesday's deadline passed without dinner or any action from Enron . While it appears from the tapes that the parties had been close to an accord, Eric Thode, a spokesman for Enron 's trading branch, says: \"At no time was there anything remotely resembling a deal with Mr. Euell.\" Mr. Euell got the DOE to agree to extend the deadline for another 24 hours and, after a round of frantic phone calls, says he collected pledges from a group of European banks to support the $93 million letter of credit. But, when the new deadline expired, he still had failed to get the proper paperwork to the DOE, which then declared his award to have lapsed. \"They played me,\" Mr. Euell complains, blaming Enron for the missed deadlines. Still, he says, the experience amounted to an instant \"Ph.D.\" in oil. Next time, he vows, he will have his own letter of credit. The DOE said late last week that it will accept new bids on the seven million barrels of oil Messrs. Stroud and Euell forfeited. As for Mr. Peek, he remains the mystery man of the three. His company, Burhany Energy Industries Inc., was formed Aug. 21. It employs no one but Mr. Peek himself. Staffers at the Florida Black Business Investment Board, where Mr. Peek works as a business-development specialist, said he had taken last week off. Shutters were drawn at his modest, one-story house in Tallahassee. Phone calls to Mr. Peek were forwarded to an unidentified neighbor. In an e-mail to a reporter, Mr. Peek apologized for being unreachable. He was \"working relentlessly to consummate this transaction\" and couldn't \"entertain any distraction at the moment.\" On Saturday, the Department of Energy announced that Mr. Peek had successfully transferred his interest in three million barrels of government oil to Hess Energy Trading Co. of New York, a partnership that includes Amerada Hess. Amerada Hess Vice President Carl Tursi said he could give few details of the deal, except to say that he believes there was an \"arrangement\" that resulted in \"a lot of money\" for Mr. Peek.

We have subsequently prepared a detailed draft analysis and costing of our claims (the \"Particulars of Claim\") which has been served on ICI's lawyers , Herbert Smith . They have come back with some requests for supporting documentation which we are currently dealing with.The Sale of Business Agreement requires us , unless ICI agree to settle which seems highly unlikely at this stage , to issue formal court proceedings against ICI before 21 November in respect of the Halochems. claim and before 17 December in respect of DuPont   . We wish to deal with the two claims together and , accordingly , it is proposed that we issue proceedings , at latest , on 16 November . Issue puts us into a formal procedural timetable . ICI would have 14 days to reply indicating whether they wish to defend and a further 14 days to issue a defence , though this period is generally capable of being extended by a further 28 days . The process of discovery , whereby each side has the opportunity to examine relevant documentation in the possession of the other , would probably begin after 3 months or so . If we were to go to full trial , this could be in the second half of next year .If we don't issue proceedings before the relevant dates , we lose the right to bring the relevant claim completely unless ICI has waived the requirement that we issue proceedings by these dates , which they have shown no inclination to do.The downside of issuing proceedings is that , whilst we are entitled to withdraw them at any stage if we decide not to proceed with the claims , we would then be liable for much of ICI's legal costs from the date of issue to the date of withdrawal .   Our lawyers' view   is that , were we to go to full trial and lose , the potential aggregate liability for ETOL's legal costs and ICI's legal costs would be between o1 million and o1.5 million (our current costs are around o70 , 000 ).In terms of the chances of success of our claims were we to go to full trial , I believe   , and am advised , that the DuPont reduced steam-take claim is more likely to succeed than the Halochems. shutdown claim . Given the legal complexities of contractual warranty claims , I do not think it would be wise , at this stage , to be overly confident of success at full trial . However , there is certainly , in my view , good potential for achieving a settlement with ICI which may involve more than simply a cash payment (eg restructuring of key contracts , land deals etc. ) .We do know that , as a matter of practice , ICI ignore potential claims unless proceedings have been issued . Issue of proceedings should , thus , be viewed primarily , at this stage , as a necessary means of getting ICI to the negotiating table . Their costs will not ramp up significantly until discovery starts , so we should be ready to monitor closely and constantly our prospects in the litigation as against our potential exposure should we withdraw or lose .On the basis of the above , I would recommend that proceedings are issued against ICI and would very much welcome your views or comments on this.Regards.Jon   \n"

(E-mail)\" &lt;richard.b.sanders@enron.com&lt;\t\t\t cc: \"Mark Haedicke (E-mail)\" &lt;mark.e.haedicke@enron.com&lt;\t\t\t Subject: Withdrawal from PX Core MarketRichard, Here is my quick reaction to the idea of Enron terminating its PXparticipation agreement in the Core Market: 1. PX tariff 18.3 says that a participation agreement \"may beterminated by either party upon written notice.\" 2. PX tariff 5.3 says with respect to the Core MarketProportional Charge-Back Methodology:   \"The PX Participant's outstanding default amount will becharged back to all current PX Participants based upon the percentage of itsgross sales in MWHs to the Total gross MWHs sales in the Core Market duringthe three calendar months preceding the event plus the current month todate.\"   3. PX Participant is a defined term:   \"An entity that is authorized to buy or sell Energy orAncillary Services through the PX, and any agent authorized to act on behalfof such entity.\"   4. Energy is also a defined term:   \"The electrical energy produced, flowing or supplied bygeneration, transmission or distribution facilities, being the integral withrespect to time of the instantaneous power, measured in units of watt-hoursor standard multiples thereof, e.g. 1000 Wh.   5. Ancillary services is also a defined term:   \"Regulation, Spinning Reserve, Non-Spinning Reserve,Replacement Reserve, Voltage Support and Black start together with suchother interconnected operation services as the ISO may develop incooperation with Market Participants to support the transmission of Energyfrom Generation resources to Loads while maintaining reliable operation ofthe ISO controlled grid in accordance with good utility practice.\"   Bottom line:   If a PX Participant, as defined in the PX tariff as opposedto the PX rate schedule for the CTS market, is an entity that is authorizedto buy or sell \"instantaneous power\" rather than power in the future, thenEnron by withdrawing from its PX participation agreement would no longer bea current PX participant.   Thus, there is an argument that by withdrawing inwriting prior to any chargeback in the core market, that Enron may be ableto argue it cannot be charged back.   I also looked at the ADR and dispute resolution proceduresto see if Enron had to be PX Participant to initiate the procedure andmaintain it.   Schedule 9 section 1.1 states that PX ADR procedures shallapply to all disputes between parties which arise under PX Documents.Section 2.1 states that the \"PX and PX Participants shall negotiate in goodfaith...\" It goes on to state in Section 2.2 that \"any one of the parties\"may submit a statement of claim.   Thereafter, in Schedule 9 it appears thatthe references are to parties not PX Participants.   My quick reading is thatyou still have to use and get the benefits of the ADR even if you are nolonger a PX Participant.   Operational Downside:   Does Enron have to be a PX Participant to get the PX toschedule the power that Enron has sold in the CTS market as it becomes due?In other words, if Enron is not a PX Participant, does that mean the PX willnot schedule the power leading to an Enron default under its obligations tothe PX to deliver power?   Could that lead to the underscheduling penalty ifPX   balances its schedule without Enron's power?   I do not know the answerto this but I am reviewing the tariff.

IF YOU RECEIVE THIS E-MAIL BY MISTAKE, PLEASEDELETE IT BEFORE READING, AND CALL ANDY TAYLOR AT(512)472-78000.   THANK YOU.Wollschlager Team:I took depositions Monday and Tuesday of Wollschlager's expert, DavidCotner, and the two pumpers, Royce and Devon Creager (Father / sonteam).   Cotner did nothing but plug numbers into spreadsheets forWollschlager, and did not apply any of his engineering or gas contractexpertise to his analysis.   He did not   analyze the contract, amendmentsor the dealings between the parties (such as price amendments,Panhandle program releases, etc.), for purposes of his damagecalculations.   He did not evaluate the true delivery capacity of the well,but relied totally on Wollschlager's assessment.   He admitted that he would not be comfortable submitting the calculationshe performed to a court of law as a valid damages claim, because hehas not reviewed the contract to see what the pricing, take-or-pay,credits, force-majeure, etc. provisions are, and he agreed that thosetypes of issues must be included to present a valid contract damagesclaim.   We are drafting a motion to exclude his testimony andcalculations.Royce Creager (mid-late 60's) was the pumper who pumped the well in1983 when the \"event\" occurred.   He remembered driving up to the wellthe morning after the equipment failure (we're not calling it a blowout - itwas a failure of the operator's equipment).   He noticed somethingstrange, and then realized that the \"stack-pack\" (heater and separationequipment) was not there.   He first thought someone must have stolen it,and then he saw the broken flowline, pointing up in the air, and   of the\"stack pack\" about 2000 ft. away in one direction, and the other half of theequipment about 2000 ft. away in the other direction!   He does notremember any gas flowing out of the flowline, and he's sure he wouldremember it if the gas had been flowing to the atmosphere.   (Logicalconclusion:   when the equipment failed and blew up, the emergencyshut-down valve on the wellhead did what it was supposed to, and shutthe well in, to prevent any damage to the wellbore or waste of gas, byshutting off the flow of gas.)He has absolutely no recollection of the well being shut in prior to thefailure, and no recollection of Intratex's rate requests in general.   Heagreed that it is the operator's (his) responsibility to carefully monitor theflow of gas from a well being brought back on-line after it has beenshut-in, to make sure no damage occurs.His son, Devon Creager, has been   pumping the well since early 1985,and generally has no knowledge or memory of any facts relevant to thecase.   However, he does not know of anything unusual about the well'sproduction since that time, except that it has gradually declined inproduction, which is what he would expect with any gas well.Wollschlager's deposition is scheduled for September 14.I am contacting Harper Estes today, to get possible dates for the elusivemediation.   Judge Gilles called me today (after talking to Morgan) to see ifwe needed his help to get a mediation scheduled.   I thanked him and toldhim I thought we would be able to schedule a mutually agreeable date,but told him we may call him next week if we needed him to \"help\" us.Stay tuned . . . Andy Taylor\n"

JJR was with me for the call (I felt that he deserved it).What a bizarre man   The fax, which I will send you,says to me (and Jerry Pecht, the lawyer for Bear Stearns) that \"thedefendants and/or their attorneys breached the settlement agreement with mein Glatzer vs. Bear Stearns, with whose confidential details Enron is fullyfamiliar.\"I have no idea what this means, or is intended to convey.Glatzer called and left word for me to call him back; I did.   He told JJRand I that he was interested in settling his case against Enron.   I told himthat I would pass that on to Enron, but that my sense was that Enron thoughtit had already won the case.   Glatzer said that, no, there were still thingshe was planning to file, do, etc. and that it might be better for Enron tosettle with him now \"before new lawyers come into the case.\"I am sure lawyers are just lining up to take this one for him.I told him that I could either pass on his comments to Enron, or he couldfax me a specific settlement demand.   He said he would do the latter,sometime next week.I have omitted all of the truly bizarre aspects of the conversation.

John (the Healer):   the guy actually saves lives, a tough act to top.2. Julie (the Developer):   enables young people - aka the future - to formtheir little craniums and warns them against going to law school.3. Doug (the Facilitator):   helps doctors help patients.4. Moi (the Ambassador):   doing my part to further internationalunderstanding by means of instruction and exchanges of culture as well asbodily fluids.5. Stevo (the Wheeler-Dealer): not really sure what he does, but a reliableand consistent contributor to the national GNP.   also sires chilluns easy onthe eye, so gets an honorable mention for that.6. Danna, Susan, Jean Helen, Yvonne (the Mamas):   doing a guten job but forthe purposes of this list, y'all represent neutrality.7. Maury (the Beltway Insider):   'nuff said.   only your professed desire toescape and recover some semblence of sanity puts you above8. Richard (the Suit):   doesn't chase ambulances but as Enron is a big mofocompany, you can bet that he is an integral part of the energy-procuringwing of the military-industrial complex, and as such is one of Them.probably knows who killed JFK and is rumored to be the Grand Poobah of theMasonic Lodge.   the list goes on, but then we come to...9. Camille (the Investor Extraordinaire):   not exactly a negativecontribution to society, but still sold crystal and brazos riverfrontproperty.   lost moi a whole heap of cashish, so brings up the bottom.on the whole a rather notable family, more inclined to give than to take forthe most part.   almost chokes us up to think about it.   truth be known ihave been thinking about y'all as of late and might be close to setting adate to come on back to hallowed soil.   no reason to set any dates as chiselis far from stone at this point, but it shan't be too long methinks.john the eldest and danna the nappiest, y'all should have received lettersby now.   let us know if that is not the case.well i just scrolled up and found to my dismay this is not as funny as i hadintended.   oh well.   it is better than nothing - i think - as nothing (inregard to correspondence) is something with which i am well acquainted.(exception: stevo!)   someone give a holler -hope all y'all are well and lording over all you survey in your pureunadulterated Aryan splendour.   i remainchillin', never illin'(in my mouth i gots 4 fillin's)the Ralai Lama___Get Free Email and Do More On The Web.
