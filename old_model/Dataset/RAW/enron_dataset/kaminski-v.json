I did a quick comparison for the 2000 and 20001 budget and I am showing a significant increase from last year.   Did we have an increase in headcount?   I do not know your actual budget for 2000.   I used the information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year (see 2000 Budget tab in the attached file).   The attached file contains the following tabs: Budget vs Budget Comparison of 2000 vs 20001 Allocation   Allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21.7% to ENA 2000 Budget   Estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information Research   20001 budgetThe calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in your template (Corp).   Plus, I have to add A&amp;A overhead cost that Corp will bill us for A&amp;A program (line 78).   Can we meet to discuss the allocation to ENA and the increase in plan?

This problem jumped out at us\rrecently as we were surfing the ASP News Web site.\r ASP News, which is a very good resource for anyone interested in the\rASP world, has developed a dynamic directory of network-based service\rproviders.   To give you an idea of how much information is included,\rthe directory lists four main categories and 15 subcategories.\rAlthough these categories are not exclusionary, they clearly represent\ra lot of companies.\r The question is, What does it all mean? What is the difference between\ran independent software vendor (ISV) and an ASP?   How is a prospective\rcustomer supposed to find the right vendor for its needs?\r Therein lies the rub, as they say.   ASP News=01, directory makes it appear\rthat the service provider marketplace can be clearly defined and the\rvendors listed in a neatly parsed, easy-to-understand directory.   Of\rcourse, it isn=01,t that simple.   An ASP infrastructure provider, or AIP\r(how=01,s that for an acronym within an acronym?), may, by virtue of a\rpartnering arrangement, also compete against full-fledged ASPs.   And\rwhat about the mutable ISV?   What little push is required for an ISV to\rbecome an ASP?\r The fact of the matter is that the ASP News directory made me realize\rthat we have so much information that we can=01,t see the trees.   We can\ronly see the forest.\r As providers all vie for customer attention and try to satisfy every\ruser need, their messages are becoming confused.   The service provider\rmarket has reached a point of information overload.   So much marketing\ris being pushed out that customers are hearing only noise.   The message\ris being lost.   It is as though every person in a community was on a\rtelephone party line all talking at once.   Star Trek=01,s Borg\rnotwithstanding, being on the receiving end of such a call would leave\ranyone confused about what was being communicated.\r Too much information can be worse than no information at all.   At least\rwe don=01,t have to spend time trying to understand silence.   Today=01,s AS=\rP\rmarket makes customers work too hard.\r The huge potential of this new market is attracting all types of\rvendors.   New players are jumping on the bandwagon every day (even if\ronly via marketing material).   As a result, customers are confused, and\rproviders are unable to differentiate themselves or their solutions.\rIn short, the ASP market is being held back.\r So, how do we get past the competitive chaos? We get past it in typical,\rfree-market style.   Because there are too many providers, many will\rsimply find themselves unable to compete and others will be gobbled up\rby larger players as the market coalesces into several major players\rwith significant chunks of market share and a few smaller providers\rserving niche markets.\r In our opinion, this is already starting to happen.   Many of the large\rplayers in traditional markets such as enterprise resource planning and\raccounting have already begun to form alliances to gain market leverage.\rNext, we will see many of these alliances collapse into large monolithic\rplayers, as the smaller members are simply absorbed.   Remember the\rlesson learned from the U.S. local telephone service market: Successful\rcompanies always consume their friends.\r Why does this happen?   It happens because consumers demand it.   The ASP\rmarket has been wildly successful in convincing executive decision-\rmakers that outsourcing is the way to go.   People at this level will\rnot tolerate bedlam for long.   All it takes is a few large customers\rchoosing the same ASP and the market will be on its way to downsizing\ras the winners and sure bets emerge.\r One thing is clear: The answer to ASP success is not to simply try and\rshout louder.   It is to reduce the noise level, and make it simpler for\rthe customer to understand your solution.   Remember the Borg, only when\rthere is a multitude of voices giving the same message is there a\rchance for understanding. Make sure you are sending a clear signal, if\ryou want to get through the noise.\r To contact Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim:\r---\rSenior consultant Michael Jude and research director Nancy Meachim are\rwith Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder, Colo.,\r(http:///www.enterprisemanagement.com), a leading analyst and market\rresearch firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise\rmanagement.

Technology has helped Enron create new=20\rbusinesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20\rresponsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.   You=\r=01,ve=20\rseen what technology can do at work.   Now we want you and your family to=20\rrealize its benefits at home.\r With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\rhe=20\rClickAtHome\rprogram, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20\rtechnology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=\r=20\rclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\r=20\rInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\r We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\r=20\rthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\r=20\rcase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\r=20\rcomputer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20\rClickAtHome includes the following:\r ? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=\r=20\rdisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\r=20\rsoftware. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\r=20\rconnection, including broadband, where commercially available.\r? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\r=20\rand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\r=20\rhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\r,=20\rEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\raccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.   Eligibility includes being=20\remployed at the time of implementation. =20\r? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 20001, with delivery of=\r=20\rthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.   Delive=\rry=20\rof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 20001.\r Details about this program are still being finalized.   To address some of=\r=20\ryour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\r=20\rhttp:///clickathome.enron.com.   We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=\rar=20\rfuture where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20\rsubmit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20\r We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20\rfamily.   We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=\rl=20\rby creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=\r=20\rthe broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=\r=20\rEnron is a great place to work.\r\n"

I can be reached at my private E-mail address vkaminski@aol.com.Please, feel free to suggest modifications to the abstract.Vince***&lt; The last three years were characterized by exceptionally high volatility of&lt; the power prices in the US markets. The market developments have created a&lt; number of unique challenges for energy industry economists. One immediate&lt; question we have to answer is how to measure volatility of energy prices.&lt; Although we can all agree that the prices in the power markets are&lt; characterized by high variability, the traditional measures used in financial&lt; economics (annualized standard deviation of log price returns) may not fit&lt; well electricity prices. The second challenge is to explain the sources of&lt; high price volatility and to answer the question to what extent it can be&lt; attributed to problems that can be addressed in the long run. Such problems&lt; include flaws in market design that allow some market participants to abuse&lt; market power, limited availability and/or unequal access to transmission,&lt; temporary shortages of generation capacity. Some factors underlying high&lt; volatility of electricity prices may be of permanent nature and may be a&lt; necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and expanded customer&lt; choice.\n"

I think it's a veryimportant issue and really critical to Enron. The model risk represents avery significant exposure to the company: a wrong model results in baddecisions and eventually leads to accounting errors and incorrect financialstatements.Here are my comments.1. Reasons of model risk. The main source of model risk in Enron is omittedin your list. I think it's due to the fact that the responsibility for thefinal model approval and validation is dispersed in the organization andthere no single unit/person that is vested with the authority to audit,approve   and monitor valuation models. The popular perception is that this isdone by the Research Group, but this could not be further form the truth.Given the way the organization evolved over the last few years, we became agroup of internal consultants, working on highly specialized, partialproblems (sometimes, we work on a project from A to Z, but it's an exceptionto the rule).It's imperative that this is communicated to the senior management in aprecise, non-ambiguous way. I think that this is the main source of potentialproblems and the first shortcoming of the modeling process to be corrected.2. I would expand point 3 in your draft (inappropriate application of models)and add two lower level points: a) wrong inputs b) incorrect model used for agiven transaction. TVA is an example of point a: a transaction in case ofwhich the inputs have not been being updated for an extended period of timein the past.3. Under Control Strength you can mention that several audits of the ResearchGroup model by Arthur Andersen and Darrell Duffie have been initiated at ourinsistence.\n"

It ismy pleasure to invite you to speak at Energy &amp; Power Risk ManagementMagazine Conferences' new event, Australian Energy 2000, addressing thesecond Industry Briefing - \"Learning from US experience: Lessons to belearned from the restructuring North American markets\". I appreciate thatyou are speaking a lot for us at the moment (for which I am of coursegrateful) but, when researching, yours was a name that came up repeatedlyas someone the market would like to hear from. I am hoping that perhaps youmight need to see Paul Quilkey at some point in July and that we canprovide you with another reason to cross the globe.Rather like the industry briefing that you are giving at Power 2000 thisyear in Houston, this address will be presented to the entire conferencebefore breaking into their streams.Australian Energy 2000 will take a focused look at the latest problemsfacing energy players, with the two in-depth streams I mentioned above: onededicated to energy pricing and trading and the other looking at riskmanagement and the latest business issues.This conference will be of the highly technical level that people have cometo expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage participationfrom speakers in modifying the programme to suit the audience and issues athand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please letme know; any help would be gratefully received.This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy &amp; Power RiskManagement Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to attract theleading market players by providing a first-class programme with top-ratedspeakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry.I have attached a copy of the programme for your information.Unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight. Please let me knowif you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that wecan speak on the phone as I am currently based in Hong Kong. If you wouldlike to send a colleague, then I would be happy to discuss this but itwould be great if you could complete the EPRM grand slam by addressing ourthree major annual events on three different continents!I look forward to hearing from you soon.Yours sincerely,Joel HanleyProducer, EPRM Conferences &amp; Courses - AustralianEnergy2000.doc___EPRM ConferencesRisk PublicationsHong KongTel: 852 2545 2710Fax: 852 2545 7317ww.riskpublications.com\n"

Jeff Shankman is, by the way, a great friend ofyour institution.Vince***   COMPANIES &amp; FINANCE: THE AMERICAS: Enron sees bricks and   bytes mix reshaping energy market: Purchase of MG only a start in   building B2B platforms, writes Hillary Durgin:   COMPANIES &amp; FINANCE: THE AMERICAS: Enron sees bricks and bytes   mix reshaping energy market: Purchase of MG only a start in building   B2B platforms, writes Hillary Durgin:   999% match; Financial Times ; 16-Jun-2000 12:000:000 am ; 604 words   By HILLARY DURGIN   If Jeffrey Skilling is right,   Enron's acquisition of MG is only the tip of the iceberg. Enron's president and   chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the   Houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant \"new economy\"   player across various industrial markets.   The Dollars 4446m acquisition last month of MG, the UK-based metals trader,   is only the first of more than Dollars 1bn in estimated new investments the   company is targeting. It is seeking vehicles on which to build   business-to-business (B2B) platforms in sectors such as logistics, chemicals,   agricultural products and pulp &amp; paper.   Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in   natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets. He   argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal   B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those industries.   As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce platform, EnronOnline,   which has changed the way the company does business with its customers   while significantly increasing sales.   The company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power - saw   wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 per cent in the first   quarter.   Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar energy business into   new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the competition   entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry analysts point out Enron has   proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the   largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader of gas and power in the   US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth.   \"It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an orderly way,\" says Ronald   Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. \"What they're doing here is   what they've been incredibly successful at doing,\" he adds, noting that Enron   posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) from its   wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per cent from the   previous year.   Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of the company's overall   income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr Barone sees the unit's ebit   increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years.   As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron is standardising   contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to create markets by   entering as a physical player and providing merchant, risk management and   financial services over the internet.   \"We will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide liquidity and we will   provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract,\" Mr Skilling says. \"That is an   extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B sites, they don't do that.\"   Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will triumph over the other,   bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal depends on two parties   hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing, price, credit and   fulfilment.   Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies, for example, would   rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco recently purchased a 3   per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a Houston- based, neutral   wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and American Electric   Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the   site to lend it liquidity.   Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals, Enron believes it   needs networks of strategic physical assets. In acquiring MG, Enron got a   stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical position.   \"It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more active physical spot market   in more markets in the world,\" says Greg Whalley, chief executive officer of   Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching to identify and enter   commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other markets, Enron will   deliver better pricing, price risk management services, cross-commodity   transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range of customers.   Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for restructuring an industry.   \"If you can take that platform, and you use the capabilities the bricks bring to   the table, e-commerce the industry and change the structure, you're selling for   more than a 50 multiple.\"   Copyright , The Financial Times Limited \n"

Do you want   me to make 'noise' tomorrow or to leave you until after Easter???Until then, I wanted to discuss with you an idea   that Les and I have been throwing around concerning writing a series of articles   for Risk's 'Energy and Power Risk Management'. We would like to propose to   them?that we would write an article a month, covering practical issues   dealing with energy modelling and energy derivative pricing and risk management.   The articles would be based upon sections of the book so as to promote the book,   and to reduce the effort/time involved by using?already produced material.   We would like to cover some very practical topics, but we?won't be giving   too much away as the articles are only 1 or 2 pages long.?Each article would be of?the   form;?- introduce?the concept- give an example using real data- discuss the problem with a case study?   - provide a discussion- sum up?I've included a list of potential articles at the   end of this e-mail. For example, for the first one,   \"Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy prices\", we would introduce   the concept of mean reversion,?show a graph of an equity index and an   energy price?for illustration of our point, estimate the parameter for a   series of energies over a number of seasons, and finally, discuss the   results.?We?are wondering if you would like to be   involved in this project? Your involvement needn't take much time (although it   is up to you). The kind of input we are hoping for (again, this is up to you) is   that you?would?review the list of articles and   provide?suggestions of additions or deletions, suggest reasonable data sets   or case studies to work with on each article, and then to run your eye over   \"near finished\" articles, which?we would supply to you for   your?practical experience?input.? Would something like this   interest you? If it did, we would try to sell Risk on making it a regular   monthly \"feature\" of EPRM, authored by all three of us.?We are hoping to present our proposal to Risk in   the next few weeks, so please let us know if you are interested.?Best regards.?Chris.???Potental EPRM articles;?1- Estimation of mean reversion in spot energy   prices (with parameters estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over   different seasons)?2- Estimation of jumps in spot energy prices (with   parameters estimated for oil, gas, and electricity data over different   seasons)?3- Simulating a mean reverting spot price process   for pricing energy derivatives (with case study applied to an Asian option on   oil)?4- Simulating a jump / diffusion spot price process   for pricing energy derivatives (with case study applied to a Swaption on natural   gas)?5- Simulating a mean reverting jump / diffusion   spot price process for pricing energy derivatives (with case study applied to   hourly caps on spot electricity)?6- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps   in a mean reverting spot price model (with example applied to a cap on natural   gas fitting the Forward curve and volatlity structure)?7- using a tree consistent with the forward curve   and vols for pricing swing options?8- implying a single?factor vol function from   market Futures option prices and variation of parameters thru time?9- adding jump volatility to the tree?10- An analytical pricing formula for pricing caps   in a multi-factor forward curve model(with example applied to the same cap on   natural gas and a discussion on the differences between the two   approaches)?111- Estimating volatility functions for   multi-factor forward curve models (with estimates of oil data over different   periods)?12- Estimating volatility functions for   multi-factor forward curve model from market option prices?13- pricing swing option in multi factor model   using tree for exercise strategy?14- comparison of VaR methodoligies applied to the   same energy derivativ portfolio.?\n"

      "body": "\nReviewed by Mark Williams, SVP RiskManagement, Citizens PowerThe long awaited second edition of Managing EnergyPrice Risk has finally arrived. It has been four yearssince the first edition was published. During this hiatus,a lot has happened as risk management within therapidly expanding energy industry has come of age asa respected discipline. The second edition is a richcompilation of papers by a surprisingly representativegroup of industry leaders, practitioners and academics.The books strength is that it reinforces the fact thatrisk management principles initially applied to a narrowband of energy commodities can and should be appliedacross a wide array of energy commodities includingelectricity. As expected the book does a solid job incapturing an international perspective on the variouschallenges, which are not isolated to any onecontinent but are global in scope. It includes a lengthyintroduction that effectively frames risk managementprogress, advancements and innovations that startedin the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to thenatural gas and most recently expanding to theelectricity industry.Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15chapters, all of which include an introduction, whichminimises the disjointedness that you may expect froma book written by a large number of authors. Otherimprovements in this second edition include expandedgraphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and aseparate glossary, which provides the reader withadditional reference material.In particular the chapter on energy options written byMichael Hampton is a useful primer and provides thereader with a concise explanation of option theory,pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practicalguidelines for distinguishing between hedging and purespeculation. For the more advanced reader, thechapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by VinceKaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni isparticularly strong as it outlines the challengesassociated with the exotics and effectively documentsthe latest methods used by leading practitioners inpricing such instruments.Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for DerivativeContracts in the Energy Environment by threeconsultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well writtensummary which addresses the numerous tax relatedissues including a timely discussion on the US FinancialAccounting Standards Board's Statement 1333 (seeEPRM October 1999, page 222). Having this taxinformation housed in one concise chapter is of greatvalue.The second edition however is not without flaws. Inparticular, it would have been useful to have moreinformation on the current challenges risk managersare confronted with in the power industry includinglatest advancements in volatility and correlationestimation techniques. Additional attention could havealso been placed on the shortcomings of the currentmarket structure and methods in finding and applyingappropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In thefledgling power market, this continues to be one of theprimary challenges.In summary, this second edition of Managing EnergyPrice Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in theprior edition and is a valuable reference book for thenew recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcomeedition to any risk management library.\n"

He is still working on his dot-com business and wants topursue this opportunity.2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad or a stipendrefund check should show up on March 15.3. I told Brad that   a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his future employment opportunitieswith Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs.

More significantly, even if snowpacks remain high in the Pacific Northwest, normal demand growth coupled with normal runoff patterns in the second and third quarters of 2000 would*   reinforce the likelihood that gas prices will again set the floor for on-peak power prices*   keep differentials across western power markets narrow*   support higher power prices and increase volatility as gas-fired generation is run more intensively to meet demand in a market with tightening capacity marginsFrom 1999 to 2000, natural gas demand will swing upward by nearly 1,2000 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the third quarter in response to a return to normal hydroelectric output and demand growth. Gas price increases will follow from this increased demand. Although differentials between Topock and the Henry Hub during the third quarter of last year averaged only $0.05 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price, CERA expects to see differentials this year averaging around $0.25 per MMBtu above Henry. This stronger western demand should also narrow differentials between the Henry Hub and the San Juan Basin, and to a lesser extent, between Henry and the Permian Basin.Western Snowpack and Hydro Capacity: A Subregional StorySince the beginning of winter the Pacific Northwest has received normal precipitation, with greater snowpacks in the northern part of that region than in the southern part. California currently lags behind historical precipitation levels at roughly 26 percent of average (see Figure 1). Given current conditions, it is possible that California will end winter at below-average hydroelectric conditions.Western hydroelectric facilities are concentrated in Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, which contain over 75 percent (roughly 46,5000 megawatts [MW]) of the Western Systems Coordinating Council's (WSCC's) hydroelectric capacity, producing 80 percent (roughly 253,5000 gigawatt-hours [GWh]) of the region's total hydroelectric generation in an average year (see Figure 2). Because of this high concentration of facilities, above-average precipitation in the Pacific Northwest can help to offset below-average precipitation in California and other parts of the West, although transfer capabilities limit the amount of energy exported from those regions.Power Markets for 2000: Building on 1999 DynamicsDespite hydroelectric output that was 15 percent higher than average in 1999, western power prices reflected the cost of gas-fired generation resources during nearly all periods of the year. This was a greater proportion of the year than in 19998 even though hydroelectric production in 19998 was only 95 percent of 1999 levels.* CERA expects several factors to strengthen this dynamic in 2000, assuming normal weather conditions:*   Western demand growth. Normal weather and economic growth will increase regional demand by roughly 2 percent in 2000. Growth will be strongest in the second and third quarters, at 6 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, adding 9,000 GWh of demand in the second quarter, followed by 6,000 GWh in the third.*   Return to normal hydroelectric production levels and patterns. Not only was 1999 hydroelectric production above normal, but 1999 Pacific Northwest runoff was prolonged by cool weather in the second and third quarters. Normal runoff dynamics in 2000 would remove roughly 6,5000 MW of hydro capacity from the Pacific Northwest resource stack from the second to the third quarters (see Figure 3). By contrast, Pacific Northwest hydroelectric capacity was depleted by an estimated 3,000 MW from the second to the third quarters in 1999 as a result of slower snowpack melt. This provided unseasonably high hydroelectric availability in the Pacific Northwest through the third and fourth quarters. The combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a normal-weather year in 2000, a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a second quarter peak, and higher West-wide demand will increase the pull on nonhydroelectric generation resources (see Figure 4).*   Energy exports to California. Sustained hydroelectric availability in 1999 in the Pacific Northwest allowed exports from the region to California to remain strong through the third and fourth quarters, with exports at 150 and 290 percent of normal, respectively. Exports added roughly 1,4000 average megawatts (aMW) above average---and as much as 2,000 aMW in August---to California's resource base throughout the year. For 2000, CERA expects normal hydroelectric exports to average roughly 2,000 aMW (total of 17,5000 GWh) during the year and 2,4000 aMW (total of 5,3000 GWh) in the third quarter (see Figure 5).In 2000 the combination of normal load growth, normal spring and summer weather, and reduced hydroelectric availability will cause capacity margins to shrink, particularly in California (see Figure 6). The impact on power and gas prices will be*   Higher average power prices. Lower average streamflows will diminish the output of run-of-river hydroelectric facilities during peak summer demand periods. As runoff dwindles into the summer, production from reservoir-fed facilities is available for a decreasing period of the on-peak hours. Other generation resources, particularly gas-fired, will be used to meet demand during a growing number of shoulder and off-peak hours in 2000. On-peak power prices will be driven higher by the increased use of gas-fired generation during shoulder hours. Off-peak power prices will respond to the greater reliance on gas-fired generation during those hours.*   Higher average gas prices. Gas demand for power generation is expected to increase by 6000 MMcf per day on average in 2000 and by up to 1,2000 MMcf per day in the third quarter. This will contribute to price strength in western gas markets and to the higher costs of generating power.Natural Gas MarketAlthough the effects of a return to normal hydro conditions become most evident in the third quarter as overall generation loads increase, CERA expects that some decline in hydroelectric output relative to last year is already causing a modest increase in gas demand in California. Although January West Coast weather has been comparable to last year, flows into California are up by 3000 MMcf per day so far this month; storage withdrawals are up on a year-over-year basis as well. Based on the lower snowpack and lower average precipitation in California this month relative to last January, in-state hydroelectric generation explains approximately 4000 MMcf per day of increased gas demand.Normal hydroelectric generation this year will likely bring a 250 MMcf per day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first quarter. Early indications of normal-to-above-normal snowpack and precipitation in the Pacific Northwest should center these increases in California.This modest demand increase has helped support prices in the western markets, with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well. Weather in both the United States as whole and the West averaged 10 percent warmer than normal during December, but during January temperatures in the West averaged only 8 percent warmer than normal while temperatures in the United States averaged 30 percent below normal.Western Regional PricesOver the next two months as seasonal heating loads within the West begin to tail off and hydroelectric generation increases modestly, differentials between western producing basins and the Henry Hub should widen. At the same time, as required flows into California decline, the Topock premium above Henry Hub prices should decline, with prices eventually falling below the Hub price. However, with normal weather in the West, that general weakening in western prices will likely take place toward the end of February and into March. Given the warm January, CERA expects heating load to decline by only 4000 MMcf per during February. Loads look sufficient to sustain western differentials near current levels.CaliforniaAs more normal winter weather takes hold in the East, prices should increase in that market relative to California. So far this month, strong flows into the state have held Topock differentials around $0.10 per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub. During February flows into the state are expected to decline somewhat as heating demand begins to decline. Table 1 shows expected flows into California for winter 1999/2000 compared with winter 19998/1999. That weakening in the Topock differential is limited, however. Expected lower storage inventories in California relative to last year, as well as a low upside to eastern prices, should keep Topock prices from falling more than $0.05 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during February. Topock prices are expected to maintain a $0.03 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub price (see Table 2).Pacific NorthwestAlthough some cold weather in the Pacific Northwest has held Malin prices close to Topock prices during January, CERA expects the Malin price to weaken relative to Topock during February---and more dramatically in March. Two factors are expected to contribute to this weakening:*   Hydroelectric output. Although February will bring a decline in heating load in both the Pacific Northwest and California regions, gas will receive some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in California. In the Pacific Northwest gas demand is limited during spring even in normal hydroelectric generation conditions.*   Canadian flows. Flows to the West Coast on Pacific Gas Transmission during the first quarter of 1999 dropped from an average of 2.6 Bcf per day during 19998 to 2.4 Bcf per day as Canadian supplies headed into the Midwest on the Northern Border expansion. This year, given the year-over-year increase in Canadian supply, those flows into the Pacific Northwest should rebound to 19998 levels.The Topock-Malin differential so far this month has averaged only $0.06 per MMBtu. During the first quarter of 1999, that differential averaged $0.09 per MMBtu. Because of the forces described above, CERA expects a wider differential---$0.13 per MMBtu---this February.Rocky MountainsSimilar forces will drive a widening in Rocky Mountain prices relative to prices in the south. Regional Rockies supplies are likely to increase as regional demand declines---although warm January weather will limit declines to 1000 MMcf per day during February. The decline in heating load in the Pacific Northwest, with continued strong Canadian imports, will allow increased exports from the Pacific Northwest into the Rocky Mountain region on Northwest pipeline---similar to 19998 conditions. Within the Rockies, supply builds continue in the Powder River Basin; the new Fort Union and Thunder Creek gathering systems are now delivering a total of approximately 1000 MMcf per day into the Rocky Mountain interstate pipeline system. Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub should average $0.25 per MMBtu during February.SouthwestAs demand declines and supply builds in the Rocky Mountains, CERA expects the spread between Rocky Mountain and San Juan Basin prices to increase slightly, but for February, Rockies heating load will likely keep the prices close. Although the differential between the two basins has averaged $0.03 this month and held at less than $0.05 during December, a $0.05 per MMBtu spread appears likely for February. This slight increase marks only the beginning of a wider divergence. CERA expects the differential between the two basins to widen to over $0.15 per MMBtu this summer as San Juan prices gain support from strong demand in California power markets.***end***Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated tables and graphics.Please note: should a link not occur using the above URL, please use the following:http:///www.cera.com/client/ce/alt/012000_16/ce_alt_012000_16_ab.html***This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain informationfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Many independent software\rvendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applications\rto use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded.\r Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieve\routright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some of\rthe original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software.\rPervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of\r\"Pervasive SQL 2000,\" a true relational database system which\rnevertheless still purports to support applications written to the\rBtrieve 6.x specification.\r A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is no\rlonger an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell still\ruses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed products\rdatabase (sys:system\\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1\rincludes only a two-user license for SQL 2000   enough for the\radministrator to add new products and services, but not enough for any\rBtrieve-based applications the network might be running.\r There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s an\revaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-use\rlicenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your software\rvendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administrators\rcould be caught off-guard when applications stop working.\r For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10\rincluded with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn't\rtested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and   the real\rkiller   most current applications (such as Computer Associates\rArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15.\r Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade to\rNetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining the\rrequisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what you\rwant to do, or if switching to a different application is the better\rchoice.\r To contact Dave Kearns:\r---\rDave Kearns is the Word Wrangler for Virtual Quill, a writing agency\rserving the computer and networking industries.

Last   year   the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were   the peakiest,   but   it reversed   this year   with   the   West   being highest   at the peaks   and in New England ---   but only   in early May 2000 were   hgih peaks   apparent   there.Demand   can vary from half the peak max   to the max.   Peakers   can be on the margin on the upper half of the supply mix in many markets.   We need to watch   gas prices   this   winter   as they can effect   winter peak power prices---not   just a   summer phenomenon.Where   are   the most gas plants   now on the margin?   Ercot, FRCC, Neepool, NYPP, SERC, WSCCA   DISCONNECTThere   is   a disconnect   in the on-peak forward market price for power in Texas now; with the   added   5 GW   Texas forward markets   do not seem to   take this   into account yet.   (Note:   Vince Kaminski) The   Texas forward   market   should be   very soft   next summer   unless   we return to   105 degree F   temperatures.   New England   is   just one year behind   Texas   in its overbuild.One main   reason for the   spikes   in Calif   is   power plants   did not   get   built in Calif   due   to   a lack of   a capacity   charge ...and   this is not a panacea...as Calif also   has   many   enviro/siting   hurdles   that challenge   developers   who want to site as well.   .TSUNAMI OF   MERCHANT   CAPACITY PLANNED?CERA   sees   over   240,000   MW   of planned   capacity over   the   2000-20005 period;   with   25,000 MW   being   completed   in   2000;   35 MW under construction   for   20001 and 15 000 MW under   construction for   20002---   but   the market   only needing   13 000   to   15 000 MW   a year.   This   shall   lead   to   many   and large deferrals and   delays, especially in   20001   and 20002.   What   has   been the recent   history?   US   wide   over thepast   3 years   just   111 percent of the planned   capacity   was   actually finished   and   18 percent   of that planned   was   actually   under construction.   They   assume   a   24 month   construction completion   time.FOR PROFIT   TRANSMISSIONCera   sees   Allegheny Energy   in PJM West;   Entergy in SPP;   Southern   in SERC   and Alliant   in MAPP   as all for profit transcos.TYPICAL   O&amp;M COSTS   IN U.S.   TRANSCOS Why   do   O&amp;M   costs   differ   widely   among   transcos?   Some   costs   are   3   to 8 times higher   than the norm   at $5000 in O&amp;M expense   per 5000   system   miles   in size.   Regulatory   overhang   allows   this...this is   weather   adjusted   to remove   high   costs   from   big   freezes   etc.USING REAL OPTION MODEL   VS   POWER PLANT   NPVYou   want to   try to have   the base value of   an asset   going   forward   when you expect volatility   and include   historical   spreads   and   fuel/power   price   swing   assumptions.CALIFORNIA   MARKET IS BROKENThis market   starts   to   work   only after it   gets into   a reliability crisis.   No incentives   to add power   plant   capacity   andhuge hurdles   against   siting   even when the market   signals the   need is   there.   Will the   regulator's post 2000   fix   make it   worse?PEAK POWER   DEMAND   FORECASTAs   percent   per year   change   vs   2000   Cera   sees   20001   as follows:New Eng   / New York 6.3 /   6.2   percentPJM / ECAR   7.7 / 4.4 percentMAIN /   MAPP   3.0 /   -0.1SERC /   FRCC   1.3 /   2.3   percentSPP /   ERCOT   4.0   /   2.3NWPP /   Rockies   -6.8   /   -0.6AZNM /   Calif-SoNV   -0.9   /   4.0USA   avg   up   2.6   percent   It   looks   like Calif. in in for a   touch summer   in 20001   as well.NATURAL   GAS   PART   TWOSUPPLY   SHORTYear   20001   supply   rebound could   be   8000mmcfd   to 1.0   bcfd;   Canada   in 20001   up only   4000   a   day; in the US   we   need   2   bcfd   more supply   for   20001   demand.   alone   let alone   storage   refill... yet   acold winter   now   could   add   3   to 4   bcfd   to demand   and slash   storages.

Both the approval of the Large Combustion Plant Directive by EU environment ministers and the agreement on German nuclear phaseout between the German government and industry could involve the early removal of existing, low-cost generating plants from the European power capital stock in the 2010-15 time period and their subsequent replacement by natural gas-fired turbines.***end*** Please see attachment for complete Alert.

Significant year-over-year weather changes have always affected western energy markets, with swings in hydroelectric generation and summer weather determining the outputs of gas-fired, coal-fired, and even nuclear generation. The shift from a dry year to a wet year can change annual gas use for power generation by as much as 1 billion cubic feet per day or 36 percent of total generation demand. Consequently, a return to normal summer weather in 2000 would significantly boost gas flows for power generation, while also adding to coal generation and increasing both power prices and volatility. Gas markets in the West and across the continent in November have experienced unseasonably low demand and---as in recent days---sudden drops in prices. CERA sees the current weathe!!!r effects as temporary and expects prices to rebound with the arrival of more seasonally normal weather.***CERA Alert : 111/15/1999***Title: Russian Gas to Turkey: Is Blue Stream in Trouble?Author: GustafsonE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Eurasia EnergyURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/fsu/alt/1115999_14/fsu_alt_1115999_14_ab.htmlSummary:The momentum behind Russia's Blue Stream gas export pipeline to Turkey has suddenly dissipated; because of delays on the key \"protocol\" on tax concessions for contractors, project financing has hit a snag. Both sides insist the delay is only \"technical,\" but recent events suggest more serious problems. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's decision not to sign the tax protocol in Moscow last week could be a reflection of Turkish concern not to embarrass the United States at the upcoming OSCE summit, or to endanger the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, which the Turks strongly favor. After the summit the Turks could return to their own game plan---to nail down their future gas supplies, whatever their source. But that may be too simple a reading. The Turkish ruling coalition recently has shown signs of strain, and Blue Stream has come under attack from several directions inside Turkey. Although once the summit ends, the Turks and Russians could continue negotiations on Blue Stream---but in the char!!!ged political atmosphere in both Ankara and Moscow, nothing is certain.***CERA Alert : 111/15/1999***Title: Will Russia Have Free and Fair Elections?Author: ColtonE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Eurasia EnergyURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/fsu/alt/1115999_17/fsu_alt_1115999_17_ab.htmlSummary:Russia's 1999-2000 election cycle is being closely watched to see who wins and, more importantly, if the elections are held freely and fairly. Despite allegations that Yeltsin's \"Family\" clique will find a way to subvert elections, Russia looks more likely to stay on track, at least in next month's parliamentary elections. Broader public discussion of the danger of electoral corruption and fraud has taken place, a more balanced Central Election Commission has been established, and the interaction of regional players in the electoral process has occurred---all positive developments on the eve of elections. Yet, despite the implementation of positive changes, electoral abuses are likely to occur. Only time will tell how significant such abuses will be and what they will mean for the future composition of the Russian government.***CERA Alert : 111/24/1999***Title: Who's Who in the Russian ElectionAuthor: ColtonE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Eurasia EnergyURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/fsu/alt/11124999_10/fsu_alt_11124999_10_ab.htmlSummary:Russia's nascent party system brings with it a complicated web of old and new players and coalitions of players all hoping to cross the 5 percent threshold in the December 19 parliamentary elections. The formation of a multitude of parties and quasi-parties poses a challenge to constituents struggling to develop an understanding of who makes up these parties, where they sit on the political spectrum, and how they will best represent their interests if elected to office. Yet some parties in the upcoming elections do enjoy the benefit of some level of experience, with almost a third of this year's candidates having run in the last election. Furthermore, the consolidation of political factions since 19995 has helped establish more lucid political categories with which to classify parties. Although immature, Russia's party system has made headway since the 19993 and 19995 elections and will certainly prove to be an interesting race to watch.***CERA Alert : 111/30/1999***Title: Lukoil Buys Neftokhim: New Step in Russian Producers' Expansion into Eastern EuropeAuthor: TabarovskyE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Eurasia EnergyURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/fsu/alt/11130999_17/fsu_alt_11130999_17_ab.htmlSummary:Lukoil's acquisition of a controlling stake in Bulgaria's largest oil refinery, Neftokhim, marked a new step in Lukoil's expansion into the East European downstream. But Lukoil is not the only contender. Yukos has proved to be a serious competitor, expanding into the markets that have traditionally belonged to Lukoil. Despite availability of alternative sources of supply, East European refineries continue to rely heavily on Russian crude, putting Russian producers in a strong negotiating position vis-.-vis the refineries and Western competitors.***CERA Alert : 111/29/1999***Title: European Energy Signpost---Marching to Market: The Zeebrugge Trade in GasAuthor: BlakeyE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: European Gas &amp; PowerURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/egp/alt/11123999_10/egp_alt_11123999_10_ab.htmlSummary:Two months into the 1999/2000 heating season in Europe it is already clear that a new basis for pricing and trading gas in the Continental business---the march to market---has begun. Principal-to-principal gas trade at Zeebrugge is taking place, with an increasing number of participants. A new \"standard contract\" and a so-called Hub Services Agreement were launched last week, under the auspices of Belgium's Distrigaz. Together these agreements provide mechanisms for day-ahead and within-the-day trading.***CERA Watch : 111/04/1999***Title: Afloat but Adrift? Energy Markets and the Undercurrent of ChangeAuthor: Global Energy TeamE-Mail Category: WatchProduct Line: Global EnergyURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/ge/wch/11103999_111/ge_wch_11103999_111_ab.htmlSummary:Technology and geopolitics feature prominently in CERA's November 1999 Global Energy Watch. E-commerce is growing exponentially, with the energy industry contributing to this new revolution in information technology. A major geopolitical shift is under way, with OPEC and participating non-OPEC countries committed to limiting production by an additional 2.1 million barrels per day to reduce excess oil inventories. The result---a near doubling of oil prices in less than a year---assures that companies and oil-producing governments will end 1999 with stronger balance sheets and budgets more in line with societal and corporate needs. The Asia Pacific region's recoveries---while not assured---look stronger than six months ago. China, Japan, and Indonesia remain question marks, but Thailand, Malaysia, and India look promising, and Korea is rebounding well. In the United States and Europe restructuring continues in the electric power and natural gas sectors. As corporate mergers continue!!! to increase in number, with new announcements almost weekly, these companies as well as smaller, independent competitors increasingly turn to technological innovation to stay ahead of the competition.***CERA Private Report : 111/09/1999***Title: Special Report: Africa's Emerging Electricity MarketsAuthor: MitterE-Mail Category: Private ReportProduct Line: Global EnergyURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/ge/pr/11105999_16/ge_pr_11105999_16_ab.htmlSummary:Substantial sections of Africa are now open for business within the global power community, and early entrants have found rewarding opportunities up and down the power value chain. But incomplete reform processes and often-difficult operating conditions mean that investment in Africa comes with substantial risks. CERA argues that successful investors will draw not just on favorable skill sets and fuel supply positions, but also on localized understanding of emerging regional markets, augmented crucially by on-the-ground experience.***CERA Alert : 111/19/1999***Title: Comg?s (G?s Noroeste) Privatization: Oncoming Competitive DistributionAuthor: Durbin, Mattos, WrobelE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Latin American EnergyURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/111999_15/la_alt_111999_15_ab.htmlSummary:The successful privatization of the northwest region of the Comg?s concession area indicates that private investors are responding to the government's desire to create a competitive energy market. Agip, a part of ENI of Italy, made a winning bid of US$143 million, or US$86 million above the base price. Agip already tried to purchase Comg?s but lost to the consortium of British Gas and Shell by US$231 million. Agip's purchase of the concession is central to the creation of a competitive gas distribution network in S?o Paulo. This greenfield concession is outside the congested metropolitan area, meaning that it will have a lower cost per mile of construction to develop its infrastructure-potentially resulting in lower tariffs than BG/Shell's existing Comg?s concession.***CERA Alert : 111/19/1999***Title: Argentina: Increased Water Flow Keeps Power Prices SoftAuthor: WrobelE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Latin American EnergyURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/la/alt/111999_14/la_alt_111999_14_ab.htmlSummary:Monthly power prices in October continued down September's lower price path. Although demand levels were similar to September's, hydro output continued to increase its share of output, but counteracting this increase was higher unavailability of thermal generators. This low price path appears to be the forecast for the months to come, with fluctuations around $15 per MWh being the result of changes in demand, thermal unavailability, and hydro output. Dramatic price spikes have not occurred and are not expected in the near term without some unexpected loss of low-cost capacity. The price spikes that do occur will likely be infrequent and around $30 per MWh. Looking ahead, the concern of the market continues to be that if new low-cost capacity is added to the already oversupplied market, power prices have only one way to go---flatter and down.***CERA Alert : 111/23/1999***Title: Brazilian Oil Markets: Finishing 1999 on an Upswing?Author: Scott, MattosE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Latin American EnergyURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/la/alt/11123999_16/la_alt_11123999_16_ab.htmlSummary:Brazilian oil product demand continues to be affected by the economic slump in addition to higher product prices. Nevertheless, CERA expects that fourth quarter demand will improve, with a significant recovery in the first quarter of 2000. Regional product demand highlights include the south and southeast regions, which account for approximately 70 percent of total product demand in Brazil.***CERA Decision Brief : 111/10/1999***Title: CERA Long-term OutlookAuthor: N. American Natural Gas TeamE-Mail Category: Decision BriefProduct Line: North American GasURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/nag/db/1110999_12/nag_db_1110999_12_ab.htmlSummary:The natural gas industry faces the challenge of developing adequate supply resources and infrastructure for what could become a 30 trillion cubic foot (Tcf) market in the United States over the next decade. CERA assesses the long-term impact of this challenge on the North American gas market through a series of three distinct and internally consistent scenarios.Although all three scenarios are highly plausible, market indicators as of the winter of 1999 point to a longer-term path more consistent with the Gas-Favored scenario, with a near- to midterm risk that the market could be driven up to a balance more similar to the Supply Realignment scenario. Key uncertainties to watch over the next year as signposts to the future path of price include the extent of the supply response, the stability of the US economy, and penetration of gas into the power generation market.***CERA Alert : 111/15/1999***Title: Midmonth Report: The Late StartAuthor: N. American Gas TeamE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: North American GasURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/nag/alt/1115999_16/nag_alt_1115999_16_ab.htmlSummary:A late start to the heating season temporarily releases pressure in the gas market, but it does not change market fundamentals. The warm weather during the first half of November has delayed storage withdrawals. However, it has not endured long enough to allow storage inventories to offset the supply decline of 1.0-1.5 Bcf per day, despite added imports. In the event that warm weather persists for a few more weeks, natural gas storage inventory levels will be adequate for the winter season. However, it is more likely that the return of seasonal weather will bring with it a sharp rebound in prices and a market scenario of tight supply.***CERA Decision Brief : 111/29/1999***Title: A New Set of Demons? Threats to US Industrial Gas DemandAuthor: HoffmanE-Mail Category: Decision BriefProduct Line: North American GasURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/nag/db/11126999_10/nag_db_11126999_10_ab.htmlSummary:Amid the enthusiasm for growing gas use in power generation, there is a downside risk to the future of industrial gas use that has gone largely unnoticed. Indeed, the industrial sector's use of natural gas, the largest source of demand for natural gas in North America, is in danger of not growing at all or even declining over the next several years. A variety of threats is set to act on North American industrial gas demand, not the least of which is the potential for continued high gas prices throughout North America over the next several years.These threats have not received wide attention because they have been obscured by the Asian financial crisis, which forced North American industrial demand growth to a standstill beginning in 19998. While the worst of the global commodities surplus may have passed, there is as yet no rebound occurring in industrial gas consumption in North America. Instead, gas consumption in several key gas-intensive industries is now being suppressed by a different set of threats: global industrial competition, high domestic gas prices, ample supplies of low-cost gas outside of North America, continuous energy efficiency improvements, and structural change.***CERA Private Report : 111/30/1999***Title: Rediscovering the Rockies: Challenges of a Major Gas Supply RegionAuthor: EynonE-Mail Category: Private ReportProduct Line: North American GasURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/nag/pr/1112999_14/nag_pr_1112999_14_ab.htmlSummary:The rush to develop new sources of gas supply in North America is on-and the Rocky Mountains could be at the forefront of new supply development. Overall US natural gas productive capacity has declined recently through low prices and depressed drilling activity. However, demand pressure in North America is intensifying-driven by a wave of new gas-fired power plants currently under construction. The resulting higher gas prices further spotlight the need for additional supply capability from a number of regions-especially the Gulf of Mexico, western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, and the Rockies, the focus of renewed interest as an area of huge resource potential capable of meeting a substantial portion of the demand growth. The Rockies (even without the San Juan Basin) could be capable of sustaining a production level of up to 10 Bcf per day by 2015, with sustained high gas prices and integration of the pipeline infrastructure. This CERA report evaluates the resource base, ex!!!amines the region's limited growth over the past decade, and identifies the challenges facing Rockies' producers.***CERA Private Report : 111/05/1999***Title: Knocking More NOx Out of Power Generation: How Much? Who Pays?Author: Goodman, Makovich, RobertsonE-Mail Category: Private ReportProduct Line: North American PowerURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/nap/pr/11103999_15/nap_pr_11103999_15_ab.htmlSummary:Knocking more NOx out of power generation is nothing new, but the move from regulation to the marketplace means that the competitive impacts of additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions are as complex and significant now as the environmental impacts. The potential tilt to the competitive playing field has moved both old and new NOx regulations into the courts. Industry restructuring also means that the market will determine who pays the billions of dollars in NOx emission control costs. Pending court decisions will determine how much NOx emissions are allowed in power production and will also define one of the key attributes of the future competitive power business landscape.***CERA Private Report : 111/29/1999***Title: Fuel Cells---A Paradigm Shift or Media Hype?Author: GoodmanE-Mail Category: Private ReportProduct Line: North American PowerURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/nap/pr/1117999_17/nap_pr_1117999_17_ab.htmlSummary:Fuel cells have achieved some successes, but more in niche applications rather than as a mass technology at this stage. Several divergent issues such as power restructuring, technological developments, environmental issues, power quality, and reliability are converging to give a boost to fuel cells in commercial and possible residential applications. The technology still suffers under economic constraints, however, and developments in the fuel processing component of the fuel cell system will be critical to rapid commercialization.***CERA Alert : 111/16/1999***Title: Refined Products LineAuthor: VenoE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: Refined ProductsURL:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/rp/alt/1116999_16/rp_alt_1116999_16_ab.htmlSummary:Differentials versus WTI for major refined products on the US Gulf Coast increased during October3/4except for unleaded gasoline margins, which fell for the second month in a row to reach $2.16 per barrel during October. Responding to sharp increases in demand and declines in primary inventories, high sulfur No. 2 fuel oil and jet kerosene margins versus WTI climbed to $1.29 per barrel and $2.45 per barrel, respectively, during October. Distillate apparent demand skyrocketed by 0.4 mbd to 3.888 mbd and jet fuel apparent demand rose to 1.75 mbd during October, with the arrival of cooler weather and the start of the home heating oil season adding strength to both markets.***CERA Alert : 111/10/1999***Title: Hints about the Tri-lateral Producer Meeting Next WeekAuthor: World Oil TeamE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: World OilURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/wo/alt/1110999_17/wo_alt_1110999_17_ab.htmlSummary:On November 16 and 17 the oil ministers from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Mexico are planning to meet in Riyadh to discuss the oil market and continue the process of forging agreement on what to do about quotas once the current production restraint agreement expires on April 1, 2000. Hints that these ministers are considering proposing that the agreement be extended to June are helping to support prices this week. WTI and Brent have climbed nearly $1.50 per barrel so far this week.***CERA Watch : 111/16/1999***Title: Volatility with OPEC in the Driver's SeatAuthor: Hittle; StanislawE-Mail Category: WatchProduct Line: World OilURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/wo/wch/1116999_111/wo_wch_1116999_111_ab.htmlSummary:As 1999 closes, OPEC and non-OPEC Mexico face the tricky task of determining the next step after their success in reversing the price collapse of 19998. A decision must be made on when and how to allow unused capacity back in the market. The stakes are high: if they fail to bring on capacity in time, then prices could soar upward even further and undermine much of the demand growth that is helping the price recovery. CERA's new Autumn World Oil Watch provides an updated price outlook for late 1999 and 2000 based on our assessment of OPEC's possible choices. Adding upward price pressure this quarter, we have revised our estimate of OPEC adherence to the March production agreements to roughly 80 percent for the fourth quarter.***CERA Alert : 111/222/1999***Title: Iraq Turns the Oil Tap: The Politics of DefianceAuthor: World Oil TeamE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: World OilURL:http:///EPROFILE.CERA.COM/client/wo/alt/111222999_18/wo_alt_111222999_18_ab.htmlSummary:Since mid-year, the UN Security Council---particularly its five permanent members---has sought to reach consensus on a comprehensive resolution on Iraq. Recently, progress toward a comprehensive resolution seemed to be being made, until the effort unexpectedly became entangled with renewal of limited oil exports, under resolution 986, for a seventh 180-day period upon expiration of phase six on November 20.***end***Follow URL for HTML version of this message only.Please note: Should a link not occur using the the above URL, please use the following:http:///eprofile.cera.com/client/ms/ms/1203999_111/ms_ms_1203999_111_ab.html***This electronic message and attachments, if any, contain informationfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

All rights   reserved.   Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have   been somewhat slow to get off the ground.   Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since   the mid-19990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a   significant volume of trades.   Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away   from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains   abundant and relatively cheap.   As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major   natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will   remain limited, observers say.   Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the   limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he   said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one   contract against another.   Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to   establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has   not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,   capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in   New York.   The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not   offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way   to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified   portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently   offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that   hedge, he said.   Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then   hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.   stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane   explained.   The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to   natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he   said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop   indexes, Mr. Lane said. \"For the insurance buyer, such exchange   instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but   as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a   good surrogate,\" he said.   The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for   over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of   catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.   The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of   exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior   vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter &amp; Co., the reinsurance   brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.   \"The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not   looking for other ways of doing business,\" he said.   At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar   to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success   since they were introduced in the 1970s. \"There is a belief that   alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to   predict when,\" Mr. Mooney said.   Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves   established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not   brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.   Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities   Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,   however, and was suspended last year after two years of little   activity.   The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative   products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board   of Trade, which began trading the options in 19996.   Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft   traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge   catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker   at the CBOT who trades in options.   No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT   so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in   the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were   traded, Mr. Purty said.   \"I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they   really take off,\" he said.   The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to   trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance   markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative   coverage options, Mr. Purty said.   The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has   radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in   mid-19996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,   chief operating officer.   CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for   reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks   and to build balanced portfolios.   But by the time the exchange was operational in November 19996, it   was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX   wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney   said.   Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of   risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.   Sweeney said.   Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a \"cash for cover\"   exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange   include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability   coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where   coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry   loss over an agreed threshold.   Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible   through the Internet in November 19998. And late last year, CATEX   offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them   form groups whose members do business only with one another.   Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,   totaling $4000 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,   he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,   insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their   captives, Mr. Sweeney said.   \"We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied   with what we have achieved so far,\" Mr. Sweeney said.   The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents   seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their   existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was   a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last   year.   Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field   of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather   derivatives .   Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry   Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.   Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against   weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in   a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a   resultant fall in revenues.   The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,   Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,   Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering   contracts based on cold weather.   Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers   themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more   extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.   In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for   over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n"

The MMS and the National Petroleum Council have projected thatdemand for natural gas could rise to 30 Tcf a year by 2010 from currentlevels of 222 Tcf. Finding and delivering enough natural gas to meet such anincrease, even if demand takes another ten years to reach such levels, willbe not be easy, the conference was told. The Gulf of Mexico currentlyprovides about a quarter of the nation's natural gas requirements and isexpected to generate the majority of future production growth. The MMS saysthat natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico would likely rise fromabout 5 Tcf a year now to a peak of 6.1 Tcf in 20005 and then start todecline.   At best, production would peak at 6.7 Tcf in 2010 then bedin todecline. Chevron says that to meet demand of 30 Tcf by 2020, average dailygas production in the Gulf of Mexico would have to rise to 222 Bcf cubic feetfrom about 14 Bcf now. The GRI says it expects the Gulf of Mexico and Canadato be 'key pillars' in meeting US demand for natural gas. The GRI projectsthat Gulf of Mexico production can reach 8 Tcf a year by 2015, while Canadianimports will rise to 4 Tcf a year from 3 Tcf. Over the same period the GRIforecasts that supply in the lower 48 states can grow by 5.7 Tcf, with theRocky Mountains region contributing a third of the increase. Ziff Energy saidplanners and forecasters might be taking too pessimistic a view of productiondecline rates from mature gas wells in the shallow waters of the Gulf ofMexico. Those wells usually show a rapid decline in production in the earlyyears of their life but then they tend to maintain stable output forrelatively long periods. Also, the MMS said new technologies such asgas-to-liquid conversion, could help to harness stranded gas in remotelocations where pipeline systems cannot be built. Storage will also play anincreasingly important role.Offshore Drillers Beginning to Recover   The offshore oil and natural gas drilling sector has enjoyed a modestupturn in fortunes for the first quarter, but their mood remains far fromjubilant as earnings lag well behind the peak levels of 19998. The benefits ofthe strong recovery in oil prices over the past year have been slow totrickle down to drilling contractors because most large producers have notraised their drilling budgets. Over the last week most US drilling companieshave reported sharp earnings declines for the first quarter of 2000, comparedto a year ago. However, many of them posted better numbers than in the finalquarter of 1999 and even managed to better Wall Street's estimates ofearnings per share by a few cents. Although earnings are still showing scantupward momentum, their stock prices have performed strongly since last yearin anticipation of a gradual improvement. The Philadelphia Stock Exchangeoilfield services index, rose 666.8% in 1999 and is up another 31% so far thisyear. So far, the recovery has been largely confined to the shallow waters ofthe Gulf of Mexico, fueled by a scramble to produce more natural gas.Day-rates for Gulf of Mexico jackups have risen 30% compared with the finalquarter of 1999, with utilization rising to 999% from 87%. Day-rates forjackups in the North Sea and Asia, however, have fallen with utilization ofdown to 777% from 81%.Bob BrooksGPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System\n"

Right now we have five candidates, and I would imagine that a half an hour interview per person is fine.   The interviewers will be Vince Kaminski , Ben Parsons, myself and Steve Leppard.   My suggestion is that each candidate has three interviews as follows:Vince Kaminski and Anjam AhmadBen ParsonsSteven LeppardDepending on the number of candidates we would then interview from 3pm through to 6.000pm or 7pm.   I will be receiving the CVs of at least two more candidates from Huxley associates later.   One constraint is that Kirstee Hewitt can only START interviews at 5.30pm.CVs:ZIA AKBAR KIRSTEE HEWITT RAMA GATIGANTI RENE LEDIS AMIT BARTARYA Regards &amp; Thanks,Anjamx35383P.S.

As you may have heard, I tried to callto talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on realoptions from your group at Enron.   Naturally, I would be delighted if youcould speak, but I could also appreciate the possibility that someone elsemight also be a good choice.   I have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information.This is the first time this course has been offered at UT, and I wasmotivated to do so because of the \"buzz\" regarding the topic in industry.   Ihave about 30 MBA students in the class, many of whom were in the energyfinance classes offered by Sheridan Titman and Ehud Ronn (both of whom havebeen very supportive of the development of this class).   My own backgroundis decision analysis rather than finance, so I tend to approach the topicwith that perspective.   As you can see, I have covered both traditionaldecison analysis topics and a review of the options literature.   At thepresent time, I don't think there is a really complete textbook that fitsthe course at the MBA level, so I've tried to focus on how to do things inpractice, and have provided software (DPL, spreadsheets, @Risk, etc) astools for the students to use. The course is scheduled on Thursday afternoons from 3:30 to 6:30,which is a time that I chose to make possible the participation of someExecutive MBA students from Houston (3 are participating).   I look forwardto hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker, or any othersuggestions that you might have.James S.

We would appreciate assistance from your group in assessing the market over the next 3-4 years.   With the octane shortage this summer, and the strong gas and oil price environment, MTBE prices are well above budgeted levels.   How will political/environmental issues affect MTBE prices over the next few years.   Methanol prices are also now very favorable, but it would seem that North American methanol producers will be disadvantaged if gas prices in NA remain higher than the rest of the world.Your thoughts on these and any other factors affecting prices would be most helpful.   Both Dwight and I are available to meet with you or a member of your group as soon as convenient.Thanks, sorry we missed you today.JNG   \n"

This impact conference bringstogether a distinguished group ofindustry and academic leaders to discuss what is required to survive theE-Commerce shakeout, and what it takes to be a \"winner\" when the shakeouthits, full-force.Shakeouts are spawned in the boom-and-bust environment of hot emergingmarkets.   An unsustainable glut of competitors is attacted by thecontagious enthusiasm for the emerging technology.   As competitionintensifies and falling prices put pressure on margins there is a wave ofailures and mergers that removes the weaker players.Few eCommerce markets---whether e-tailing online exchanges or others---willbe exempted from the forces that cause shakeouts.   This conference willcombine lessons from markets that have experienced shakeouts, with thelatest thinking about the unique features of E-commerce, to identifysuccessful strategies for surviving a shakeout.Questions to be addressed include:- Are the patterns seen in previous shakeouts of high technology marketsapplicable to eCommerce?   What are the early warning signs of an impendingshakeout?- Which eCommerce markets are most susceptible to a shakeout?   Will therebe single or multiple winners?- Which companies are likely to survive?   What strategies will the winners use?There is controversy and uncertainty about which factors will mostcontribute to prospects for survival.   How important are first moveradvantages and building brand equity?   What do incumbents have to do toprevail?   Which business models are most robust?   How important is theability to manage strategic partnerships?These issues will be addressed with a program that encourages activedialogue and interaction and includes speakers from industry, academia andWall Street.___AGENDA***DINNER &amp; REGISTRATION - THURSDAY, OCTOBER 195:30 - 6:30pRegistration and Reception6:30 - 9:000pDinnerSURVIVING THE SHAKEOUT: FUNDAMENTALS, FADS AND THE FUTURE(John Hagel of 12 Entrepreneuring; co-author of the best-selling books NETGAIN and NET WORTH)***CONFERENCE - RIDAY, OCTOBER 208:000 - 8:30aContinental Breakfast &amp; Informal Networking8:30 - 9:15INTRODUCTION: UNDERSTANDING THE BOOM AND BUST OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES(George Day, Co-Director of the Mack Center for Technological Innovation andBoisi Professor of Marketing, the Wharton School and co-editor of WHARTONON MANAGING EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES)9:15-10:000APPLYING THE LESSONS OF THE PAST TO THE eCOMMERCE FUTURE(Adam Fein, President, Pembroke Consulting)10:000-10:30   BREAK10:30-111:30IDENTIFYING WINNING AND LOSING INTERNET BUSINESS MODELS(Raffi Amit, Goergen Professor of Entrepreneurship and Director, WhartonE-Business Initiative (WEBI); andDavid Reibstein, Woodside Prof. of Marketing, Wharton School and Director,Marketing Science Institute)111:30-12:15pTECHNOLOGY INVESTING, 15 THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TRUE(Stephen J.

It is not intended to be a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial decision-making.   Conceptually, it is a risk warehouse for the primary purpose of RAC due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems and their inability to provide timely, aggregated information useful to RAC.   RAC has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task list to accomplish its objectives.   As a firm we are woefully behind our press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile.   My most recent sojorn   in Europe is a classic example of the current systems inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of RAC having abetted poor decision making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the GRMS budget or that of the Market Risk Group in RAC.   The GRMS project is a requirement that Bill Bradford and I have in order to do our jobs.   We have delegated authority to Debbie Brackett and Rudi Zipter to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with Jonathon and his team as well as Rick Buy to provide updates.   While progress is never as fast as we would like it, in every instance in which we have only to rely on RAC, Jonathon's team and Research to make a deadline it haas been hit.   The primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other source - most recently the IT staff in London was a tremendous impediment to deadlines.   Please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note, but I feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening.   Also, I have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration on the lack of management support for this project, usually manifesting itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it.I think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted.   Please let us do our jobs.   I do not denigrate the efforts of others, but I believe that they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our consideration of their worthiness to put in OUR que or develop their own project with their own resources.Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.

Initially, we will be making markets in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference credits very quickly.The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current counterparts.   Simultaneously,   we will launch an external web site focused on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit models and research papers on effective credit risk management.   Utilising e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for corporate credit protection.   We expect to make a public announcement about these new products in late January.In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as well.   Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead the group and he will report to me.\n"

We have just signed up our firstweb provider (e-Acumen.com), who is preparing to vend our North Americanelectric generation data base over their website.   I believe we are anintegral part of their offering.   It wont be long before MarketPoint needsthe capitalization to meet our growing customer needs professionally andquickly, particularly when we sign up one or more vertical portals to vendor offer fundamental forward projections from our models.   I a loath to doso without the capitalization and staffing we need.   Also, I am loath to doso without the market reach that a partner like Enron could render instantlyavailable.I also would be eager during my next trip to Houston to continue thediscussion with you regarding how MarketPoint might benefit Enron directly.I plan to be there the last week in June.Thanks again for all your help and support.Dale\n"

Iknow we did.So, we got DSL from Pacific Bell.   It was wonderful!   But, quickly welearned that we were now exposed to hackers or others with evil intentionsbecause they could reach our computers directly through the net.   So, wehired a local consultant to build us a firewall computer.   For $250 we gota secure computer running Linux attached to our DSL on one side and ourlocal area network on the other and were no longer easy prey for thecyber-hackers.Everyone and his mother-in-law is now selling DSL or cable modem services. But, they don't tell you about the risks.Read this article and remember to acquire security when you acquire fasteraccess.http:///www.networkmagazine.com/magazine/current/0005wide.htmBob Brooks\n"

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 03/27/2000=\r=20\r08:47 AM ---\r   \"NW on Novell NetWare\" &lt;NovellNetWare@bdcimail.com&lt; on 03/222/2000 04:05:59 =\rAM\rPlease respond to \"Novell NetWare Help\" &lt;NWReplies@bellevue.com&lt;\rTo: &lt;vkamins@enron.com&lt;\rcc: =20\rSubject: Databases galore\r   NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE\rToday's Focus: Databases galore\r03/21/000\r Dear Wincenty Kaminski,\r Today's Focus: Databases galore\r---\rBy Dave Kearns\r Longtime NetWare managers lament the greater amount of resources needed\rfor newer versions of the network operating system, with many sticking\rto their NetWare 3.111/3.12/3.2 servers simply because the earlier\rversion is leaner and meaner.\r &lt;aside&lt; My first NetWare server was nondedicated and ran with 512\rkilobytes of RAM. &lt;/aside&lt;\r Some blame the Java console introduced in NetWare 4.111, while others\rfeel it=01,s just the larger amounts of disk real estate used in servers\rwhich consumes so much memory (for caching, tables, etc.).\r One area not often mentioned, though, is the proliferation of databases\rand database systems.\r NetWare has shipped with Btrieve for 15 years, and NetWare 5.1 still\rhas Btrieve on the installation disk, but also installs Pervasive's\r(the Btrieve vendor) SQL 2000 database system (Btrieve/SQL 2000 is used\rby NetWare to track installed products). Then there's Novell Directory\rServices, which uses its own proprietary database. For the adventurous,\rNetWare 4.2 and 5.x ship with a five-user version of Oracle. Sites\rusing any of the ZENWorks products get yet another database system,\rsince ZEN installs and uses Sybase to store information. Add GroupWise\r(used for e-mail at many NetWare sites), and there's another database\rsystem using the FLAIM database. That's six, and you may have more.\r Each one of these has minimum RAM and disk space requirements, no\rmatter how lightly populated any single database is. Each has its own\rmaintenance requirements. Few sites have the expertise to optimize all\rof these different systems.\r If Novell would only choose a single database system for all of these\rapplications, total cost of ownership could be significantly reduced.\r To contact Dave Kearns:\r---\rDave Kearns is the Word Wrangler for Virtual Quill, a writing agency\rserving the computer and networking industries.

I am in the process of developing the draft programme for the 2000 event, and this is the reason that I am contacting you.Building on the success of last year's event, which attracted over 230 delegates from across Europe and the US, PoweRisk 2000 will once again feature more than 50 leading power industry experts and academics world-wide. There will also be a comprehensive exhibition running alongside, cocktail parties,,, champagne roundtables, in-depth workshops * and numerous other opportunities to catch up with your colleagues.Throughout the course of my research, I have been speaking with many of the people who attended the workshop you led with Prof. Geman and Alexander Eydeland last year. The feedback has been extremely favourable and many expressed a wish to see you both participating in the main conference this year.I appreciate that you have an incredibly busy schedule, and to this end, I wanted to contact you at this early stage with regard to the dates for this year's PoweRisk conference and to outline my list of queries to you, prior to calling your office tomorrow.   I would very much like to extend an invitation to you to deliver an address at this year's main conference. The conference will be taking place in Paris, on the 4th and 5th of October (with workshops taking place on the 6th)The workshop topic last year dealt with the latest developments in risk management, pricing and trading of electricity derivatives. I would be most grateful if you could spare me some time tomorrow on the phone to discuss this area with me, and in particular the issues that you are finding most relevant to your work with Enron at present.The need to build a programme which truly reflects the needs of the global power trading and risk management industry is clear in such a conference-saturated market. To achieve this we formed our Energy Derivatives Advisory Board last year for advice on all aspects of programme development and speaker acquisition. Chaired by Prof. Helyette Geman, the Board members currently include: Ehud. I. Ronn, Mark B. Garman, Dragana Pilipovic, Blake Johnson, Les Clewlow, Chris Strickland and Christian Vrolijk. This year we are expanding the scope of the Advisory Board and   inviting a number of new members*, including Jeffrey Skilling of Enron, Bruce Williamson of Duke Energy, Heinz Dieter Waffel of PreussenElektra, Harvey Padewer of Duke Energy, Alexander Eydeland of Southern Company Energy Marketing, John Shapiro of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Jeff Porter of Koch Industries* (all confirmed and invited Board Members are past speakers at the ICBI PoweRisk event)This year, I would also like to invite you to join our Energy Derivatives Advisory Board. In return for your evaluation of the draft programme and suggestions of possible improvements and potential speakers, you would be entitled to full branding as an Advisory Board member on the conference brochure and all conference documentation, first choice on speaking slots, a free pass if not speaking, and further discounted registration for clients or colleagues.I will call your office tomorrow and would be very grateful if you could spare me a few moments to discuss the above proposals. I will also email this letter to you.My contact details are as follows:Tel: +444 171 915 5194Fax: +444 171 915 5101Email: rosef@icbi.co.ukI look forward to speaking to you and very much hope that I will have the opportunity of working with you on this year's PoweRisk conference.Yours sincerelyRosemary FitzgeraldDirector, PoweRisk 2000   \n"

I'll borrow astrategy used by all politicians: hallucinations of what theFounding Fathers intended.As you know, people were very wise in the 17000s. Unfortunately,something happened that made us all idiots.   I blame television.That's why we prefer to make our important decisions on personalfreedom based on the wisdom of dead, slave-owning dandies insteadof using our own defective brains.We have no recordings of the Constitutional debates, but I'm sureit went something like this:--- Re-creation ---Jefferson:   We haven't put anything in the Bill of Rights aboutgenetic manipulation, Internet encryption, in vitro fertilization,or mandatory drug testing.Adams: Just say \"et cetera.\"   No one is going to read it anyway.Hancock: Let's include something to encourage public nudity.   CableTV won't be invented for years and I can't wait that long.Jefferson:   Okay.   I'll call that the right to bare arms.Franklin:   That might be misinterpreted.Jefferson:   Who's the world-class writer here?   I keep your stupidAlmanac next to my chamber pot, and I don't mean for the reading.Franklin:   I am soo sorry for making a suggestion.   By the way,your house slave \"Jeff\" has your eyes.All:   HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!Adams:   You're all a bunch of asses.   I think you're giving me anembolism.Jefferson:   You have the right to ass-embolisms.   Hey, maybe Ishould include that.   How do you spell it?Dilbert TV Show Update---According to my e-mail, many Dilbert TV fans tape the show so theyhave permanent copies in their tape libraries.   While Dilbert isbeing taped, they watch other shows that are not tape-worthy.Unfortunately, only live viewing of TV shows counts for ratings.This isn't a problem for some TV shows, like \"Wheel of Fortune,\"because their viewers use VCRs to crack nuts.   But the mathematicalsets of \"people who can program VCRs\" and \"people most likely towatch 'Dilbert'\" are almost the same.   This has been a problem.The episode airing February 222nd (9:30 PM EST) in the USA willprobably determine whether the Dilbert show gets renewed.   That'sthe episode featuring Jerry Seinfeld as the voice of Comp-U-Comp,an evil computer who has taken over a company and fired everyoneexcept the guy who guards the electrical plug.   Eugene Levy playsthe plug guard.Jerry's lines are mostly written by Larry Charles, one of theoriginal writers for Seinfeld, now Executive Producer for Dilbert.So if you liked Seinfeld, this is the closest thing you're going toget.And if you know any Induhviduals who are in Nielsen families thismonth, please tell them that there's some sort of \"millionaireprize\" for watching \"Dilbert\" and answering questions posed by thevoices in their own heads.Dilbert Episode Airs On the Internet---As part of our overall pimping for the Seinfeld voice episode,we're putting an entire show (The Merger episode) on the Internetin streaming video, starting February 17th and running throughFebruary 29th.   You can find links to it atww.dilbertondemand.com.   You need the Windows Media Player, whichyou can download from the site.As far as we know, this is the first television cartoon showstreamed over the Internet in its entirety.   We made sure we didn'tresearch that fact too thoroughly so we could honestly say, \"as faras we know.\"You'll need a reasonably fast connection, but you can view theentire show, in bite-sized chunks, at your leisure.   Don't settlefor mere bragging about your DSL or cable modem connection;DEMONSTRATE your digital superiority!   Invite a neighbor who has apitiful 28.8 modem over to drool on you.   If you wear a raincoat,it's a strangely satisfying experience and you can hose it offlater.If you know anyone recently involved in a merger, the Dilbertepisode on the Internet (The Merger) is the one they'll want tosee.   Find out what's in store for companies who seek \"synergy.\"True Tales of Induhviduals---I begin the True Tales section with a personal sighting.   Irecently came upon a local road that was closed for improvements.Signs warned \"Road Closed\" and \"Bridge Out.\"   As I turned around tohead for the detour, another motorist waved me down.   We rolleddown our windows and he shouted, \"Do you think we should just movethe barricades and go for it?\"I don't know how fast one must drive in order to compensate for a\"Bridge Out\" situation, but I decided not to try it.True Tale 2---Some of our corporate policies have been rewritten.   Here's anexample from our expense reporting procedures.\"Receipts are required for all expenditures of $25 or more and, inaddition to this, receipts for a lesser amount are also required.\"Editor's note: It sounds as if some of the people in the HR areidiots and, in addition to this, the rest of them are too.True Tale 3---We received a letter from the Environmental Protection Agencystating that unless we provided answers to their outstandingquestions within two weeks they would recommend that our powerplant construction project not proceed.Apparently they failed to notice that, a) we already answered thequestions, b) their approval had already been issued and, c) the$6000 million power plant had been built nearly two years ago.Editor's note: If those are the sort of questions the EPA calls\"outstanding\" I'd hate to hear their dumb ones.True Tale 4---We had a Christmas raffle in the \"Business Intelligence\"department.   The boss drew a number and called it out.   Thedepartment statistician stood up to tumultuous applause and went upto collect his prize.   Meanwhile, another employee --- who turnedout to be the real winner --- stood up to collect that same prize.Upon investigation, the statistician for Business Intelligence hadconfused ticket 593 for 539.Editor's note: On the surface it looks as if the statistician is aboob.   But he's the only one in the room who realized that 39% ofthe time the real winner isn't present to win.   I suspect he's aDNRC member just playing the odds.True Tale 5---When a project is finished in my department we place a red dotsticker on the folder to signify its completion.   One day we ranout of red dots but still had a large supply of green and bluedots.   Dots weren't used for any other purpose so I suggested usingthe ones we have, despite their non-red color.   Color wasinsignificant.   There were only five of us in the group, socommunicating the change would be easy.My money-saving suggestion was met with resistance from cow-orkers. They pointed out that we've \"always used RED dots\" and maybe Ishould check with the department manager.   I mentioned my idea tothe manager and he said I should \"bring it up at the next staffmeeting.\"Editor's note: Ironically, it's not a dot.com company.True Tale 6---I paid for lunch with a credit card.   The manager put it throughthe electronic card machine and got a \"no dial tone\" error.   Shetried again with the same result.   Then she asked me if I hadanother card.Editor's note:   That's exactly why you should pay for your lunchusing a phone company calling card.   They have dial tone.True Tale 7---We tested our Y2K power contingency plans a few weeks before NewYear's.   The Induhviduals in IT didn't expect any downtime, so thetest was performed during the normal work day.   The idea was thatwhen power was cut, the six generators would kick on and wewouldn't notice a thing.Three generators failed to start. Two threw their breakers due tothe high load on them.   The last was overwhelmed when the previoustwo cut out and threw a tremendous surge through the lines, blowingup hundreds of light bulbs, frying fax machines, radios and pencilsharpeners along the way.   The surge jumped circuits in ourindustrial level surge protector and traveled through our \"surgeprotected\" lines to every desktop in the company plus the serverroom.   After taking out over a hundred monitors and almost fortyPCs, the surge proceeded to destroy our server room airconditioner, four huge UPS systems, thirteen servers and bothAS/4000s.   Several small fires started throughout the building,including our now half-melted Christmas tree and ourmolten-menorah.The surge then jumped the lines into the main power grid, blowingup two transformers, one of which fell on the IT manager's car(poetic justice) and cutting power on the entire block.   Theremaining generator then proceeded to burst into flames, eventuallyblowing up all six generators and burning up seven cars.This all occurred within about thirty seconds and sent 38 people tothe hospital, cost the company over $650,000 in equipment (not tomention the impending lawsuits), destroyed eight cars and causedweeks of downtime.   Three people quit the company.   One woman isstill in the hospital with electrical burns.   The resultingpublicity got us on television in five states.Editor's note: That story sounds too amazing to be true but I'mprinting it anyway under the theory that there's no such thing asbad publicity.True Tale 8---Our university library just got new computers. The librarythoughtfully provided headphones so students can listen to soundfiles without disturbing anyone nearby.   The problem is theheadphone cords have been clamped to the desk in such a way that inorder to use them, you must have your head no more than six inchesfrom your keyboard. It is great fun to see the stu-duh-nts tryingto use them.True Tale 9---I went to a Georgia DMV office to obtain a driver's license.Customers are required to produce two pieces of ID.   I presented autility bill and a copy of my latest tax return, both acceptabletypes of ID according to their published list.The agent behind the counter said she could not accept my taxreturn as ID because it was typed.   She said, \"How do we know thisis legitimate?   Anyone can get a computer or typewriter to producethis return.\"   I argued, unsuccessfully, that it was also easy toobtain pens and pencils to create hand-written returns.   I was toldto come back with a hand-written return or another acceptable formof ID.True Tale 10---I went to a fast-food restaurant one morning for breakfast.   Themoment I opened the door, I was almost swept off my feet by anoverpowering odor of gas.   I struggled up to the counter out of avague sense of duty, and said   \"You've got an enormous gas leakback there somewhere!\" gesturing towards the kitchen.The girl behind the counter shrugged and said, \"Yeah, I know, butI've been here since seven o'clock and I've gotten used to it.\"True Tale 111---I went to ask our new principal if we could have the Monday beforefinals off as a study day.   We had always gotten a study day in thepast but it wasn't on the schedule this time.   He thought for asecond and then responded, \"No, you have school that day.\"True Tale 12---About a year ago I went to buy a video for a friend's birthday.The video was rated for adult viewing only.   I was 15 years old,but they sold it to me anyway.When I got home I found out that my friend wanted the sequel, notthe original, so I took it back to the store.   The video clerk saidhe couldn't return the video because I didn't look 18.I was confused, so I attempted to clarify.   \"So, because I don'tlook 18 you're going to MAKE me take this ADULT-rated video, ratherthen let me change it for the sequel that is NOT ADULT-rated?\"\"\"Yeah, it's company policy.   If it changes we'll be in touch.\"Eventually I convinced him he was breaking the law by selling methe adult video instead of letting me exchange it for the non-adultone.   As I left, the guy behind the counter yelled at me, \"Nexttime, don't watch the video first!\"It was still in its shrink-wrap.Dogbert Answers My Mail---In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.

I'll borrow astrategy used by all politicians: hallucinations of what theFounding Fathers intended.As you know, people were very wise in the 17000s. Unfortunately,something happened that made us all idiots.   I blame television.That's why we prefer to make our important decisions on personalfreedom based on the wisdom of dead, slave-owning dandies insteadof using our own defective brains.We have no recordings of the Constitutional debates, but I'm sureit went something like this:--- Re-creation ---Jefferson:   We haven't put anything in the Bill of Rights aboutgenetic manipulation, Internet encryption, in vitro fertilization,or mandatory drug testing.Adams: Just say \"et cetera.\"   No one is going to read it anyway.Hancock: Let's include something to encourage public nudity.   CableTV won't be invented for years and I can't wait that long.Jefferson:   Okay.   I'll call that the right to bare arms.Franklin:   That might be misinterpreted.Jefferson:   Who's the world-class writer here?   I keep your stupidAlmanac next to my chamber pot, and I don't mean for the reading.Franklin:   I am soo sorry for making a suggestion.   By the way,your house slave \"Jeff\" has your eyes.All:   HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!Adams:   You're all a bunch of asses.   I think you're giving me anembolism.Jefferson:   You have the right to ass-embolisms.   Hey, maybe Ishould include that.   How do you spell it?Dilbert TV Show Update---According to my e-mail, many Dilbert TV fans tape the show so theyhave permanent copies in their tape libraries.   While Dilbert isbeing taped, they watch other shows that are not tape-worthy.Unfortunately, only live viewing of TV shows counts for ratings.This isn't a problem for some TV shows, like \"Wheel of Fortune,\"because their viewers use VCRs to crack nuts.   But the mathematicalsets of \"people who can program VCRs\" and \"people most likely towatch 'Dilbert'\" are almost the same.   This has been a problem.The episode airing February 222nd (9:30 PM EST) in the USA willprobably determine whether the Dilbert show gets renewed.   That'sthe episode featuring Jerry Seinfeld as the voice of Comp-U-Comp,an evil computer who has taken over a company and fired everyoneexcept the guy who guards the electrical plug.   Eugene Levy playsthe plug guard.Jerry's lines are mostly written by Larry Charles, one of theoriginal writers for Seinfeld, now Executive Producer for Dilbert.So if you liked Seinfeld, this is the closest thing you're going toget.And if you know any Induhviduals who are in Nielsen families thismonth, please tell them that there's some sort of \"millionaireprize\" for watching \"Dilbert\" and answering questions posed by thevoices in their own heads.Dilbert Episode Airs On the Internet---As part of our overall pimping for the Seinfeld voice episode,we're putting an entire show (The Merger episode) on the Internetin streaming video, starting February 17th and running throughFebruary 29th.   You can find links to it atww.dilbertondemand.com.   You need the Windows Media Player, whichyou can download from the site.As far as we know, this is the first television cartoon showstreamed over the Internet in its entirety.   We made sure we didn'tresearch that fact too thoroughly so we could honestly say, \"as faras we know.\"You'll need a reasonably fast connection, but you can view theentire show, in bite-sized chunks, at your leisure.   Don't settlefor mere bragging about your DSL or cable modem connection;DEMONSTRATE your digital superiority!   Invite a neighbor who has apitiful 28.8 modem over to drool on you.   If you wear a raincoat,it's a strangely satisfying experience and you can hose it offlater.If you know anyone recently involved in a merger, the Dilbertepisode on the Internet (The Merger) is the one they'll want tosee.   Find out what's in store for companies who seek \"synergy.\"True Tales of Induhviduals---I begin the True Tales section with a personal sighting.

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 05/12/2000 08:15 AM ---Scott Adams &lt;dilbertnewsletter@unitedmedia.com&lt; on 05/111/2000 07:47:45 PMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Dilbert Newsletter 30.0Dilbert Newsletter 30.0---To:   Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC)From:   Scott Adams (scottadams@aol.com)Date:   May 2000   Highlights:--- Elian Invasion- TV Show Update- True Tales of Induhviduals- Streaming Video of a Mystery in My Office- Dogbert Answers My Mail---Elian Invasion---Many of you in the U.S. have been following the fate of the littleCuban boy Elian, who came to the United States via adolphin-powered inner tube.   Some people believe Elian is some sortof Holy Child because the dolphins helped him, and because he'ssmall, leading people to assume he is a child.   I was a believer inthe Holy Child theory until the INS swarmed Elian's relatives' homeand took him against his will.   \"Where were the dolphins then?\" I ask.Maybe they were lazy dolphins.   Whatever their excuse, I'mdisappointed that we didn't get to see the INS and the dolphinsfight it out, hand-to-flipper.   That would have been good TV.Dolphins have a great defensive move where they suddenly turnaround so your fist gets stuck in the blowhole.   Then they beat yousenseless with their powerful tails.   I think we'd all like to see that.On the plus side, by my reckoning, Elian's dilemma has saved thelives of at least two celebrities, maybe more.   As you know, duringslow news periods the major networks kill celebrities and make itlook accidental.   Personally, I won't board an airplane unless thenewspaper is packed with good stories.I prefer the media's latest news-creating technique, wherein theyblame NASA for launching rockets into space and losing them.   Inreality, NASA hasn't done much of anything since 1969, when theysent three guys in helium-filled space suits to New Mexico with ablack and white camcorder.   I still remember where I was when I sawit on TV.   I was on Earth.Dilbert TV Fate---I'm not exaggerating when I say that literally dozens of peoplenoticed when Dilbert disappeared from UPN's lineup on American TV.Officially, UPN told me the show was put on \"hiatus.\"   Or maybethey said they \"hate us.\"   It sounds the same on the telephone whenyou're sobbing.Apparently someone noticed there were four new episodes that hadnever aired.   So, starting on Tuesday, May 30th at 8:30 p.m.Eastern   (7:30 Central), the first of the new Dilbert shows airs.In a master stroke of UPN programming brilliance, Dilbert followsShasta McNasty, a show geared toward viewers who are...how can Isay this...very likely to die in bowling ball cleaning machineaccidents.   Fortunately, Shasta is a filthy and sophomoric show, soit will corner the market on perverts and unsupervised minors.It's a perfect lead-in audience for an animated Dilbert TV show.If you don't understand that, you will never be a television executive.The other networks are running nothing but commercials during thattime period.   You don't need to check.   Trust me on this.March 21st Explained---Many readers were confused by the March 21st strip featuringDilbert's future self visiting his past self from across time.Dilbert asks the future Dilbert how his head got wrinkled.   FutureDilbert points to a device on his chest with a hole in the centerand says, \"Stick a finger in this hole.\"   That's the whole joke.This is an example of a cartoon that appeals to no one but me, orso I discovered from my e-mail.   I like the idea that a futureDilbert would invent a device that has no other purpose than tomake your head deformed.   It's one of those inventions that seemlike a good idea until you try it.   But the funny part (okay, justto me) is that he would advise his past self to stick a finger init, thus making the same mistake twice.In retrospect, it was just a bad cartoon.   There wasn't enoughinformation.   But it made me laugh.   If you think the cartons aremade for your benefit, maybe you shouldn't be so selfish.Why Do Some People Get Paid?---A reader sent me this story:\"Our coffee room has a bulletin board. One day a woman with a rulerand a clipboard came in and measured the distance between thepostings on the board with the ruler. She took great care tomeasure the height and width between each piece of paper, andbetween the pieces of paper and the edges of the board. Then,without a word, she checked off something on the clipboard and went away.\"I was in a daze for the next fifteen minutes.   I couldn'tconcentrate during the following meeting. I wondered, does thiswoman actually get paid for this? Does she find fulfillment in herwork? Who came up with the idea for this job? Are THEY just playingwith our minds, whoever THEY are?\"Needless to say I went back to the coffee room after the meetingand moved all the postings around.\"[Editor's note: To me, the funny part is that the author of thisstory got paid for sitting in a daze during a meeting and laterrearranging the scraps of paper on a bulletin board.]The DNRC at Work For You---A DNRC member reports on another benefit of membership.\"It turns out that my English tutor at Cornell is in the DNRC.   Itold her that I was in the organization too. That was a month agoand since then I have been getting constant 'check plusses' for myessays, regardless of my effort.\"Thanks a million!!!\"If you're not already showing preferential treatment to DNRCmembers, it's time to start.   Remember, only the DNRC has the goodsense to haze people who have no prospect of becoming members.Getting Free Stuff the DNRC Way---If you're annoying enough, you can get free services almostanywhere, as this DNRC member reports.\"My roommate and I put coins in a jar every time we used the phone.When it was time to pay the bill, we went to the bank to get thecoins counted. The teller said there was a fee for counting moneybecause we didn't have an account at that bank.   The conversationwent like this:'How much would it cost if we had an account?'''Then it would be free.'''How much does it cost to open an account?'''Nothing, it's free.'''How much does it cost to close an account?'''Um...That's also free.'''Then we'd like to open an account, count this money, then closethe account. That's all free, isn't it?'\"She spent a few seconds thinking about this, and then she let ususe the money-counting machine, for free.\"Spooky Happenings In My Office---Recently I noticed that beverages were disappearing from my office.I installed a hidden surveillance camera to identify the culprit.Check out this streaming video link at myvideoshare.com to see whatwas happening.http:///www.myvideoshare.com/vm.asp?c=4504&amp;amp;e=10ohm9GBdCOTk&amp;r=yYou'll need a Windows machine, a reasonably fast Internetconnection and Windows Media Player 6.4.

Ifyou're behind a corporate firewall, hit the \"No Video?\" button forinstructions on circumvention.Macintosh zealots should feel free to flame me as usual.Dilbert.com---We've revamped the \"List Of The Day\" area on Dilbert.com.   It's themost popular part of the site after the comics.   Some of you DNRCmembers are impressively funny.   Others just have laughably pitifuljobs that translate into amusing list items.   Either way, it'sequally funny to me.We've added a True Tales of Induhviduals page, athttp:///www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/dnrc/induhvidual.html.Submit your stories and read those submitted by others.   Feed yoursense of intellectual superiority by reading how dumb other peopleare.

Arranged appropriately,the values are Fun, Agility, Teamwork, Learning, Integrity andEmpowerment.The acronym speaks for itself: FAT LIETrue Tale---My school subscribes to a system that is supposed to help us findjobs when we graduate. It works by asking us what subjects we arestudying, what sort of job we want, etc.When I input my classes and interests it came up with only twocareer suggestions.Careers in ITCareers in LAWNeither choice appealed to me.   I tweaked my entries to see ifother options would appear.   It wasn't until I deleted 'EnglishSkills' from my list of subjects studied that it added a thirdcareer option.Careers in MANAGEMENTTrue Tale---I was standing in line at the grocery store when a loud voice cameover the intercom saying, 'Okay, shoppers, it's time for our hourlydrawing for a bag of free groceries.' In the front of the storesomeone was spinning a big wheel with the numbers 1 to 8 on it. Thevoice continued, \"If your lane number comes up, and you are at thefront of the line, you win.\" I noticed that a checker was openingthe register next to me. Just at that moment, the number of thatnewly opened lane came up on the wheel. The other customers weretoo busy cursing their bad luck to realize that the winningregister was empty.   I casually moved over to that line. With greatfanfare, I was awarded the prize --- a bag of free groceries. It wasfilled with bizarre items I would never eat, including cinnamonrice cakes, canned collard greens, Wonder Bread and the like.   So Igave the free bag of groceries to a woman who seemed terribly upsetat not winning it herself. She exploded with joy like she had justwon the lottery.Induhviduals are so easy to please.True Tale---At Denver International Airport, there are emergency exits, thetype with alarms if they are opened.   Printed on the doors aresigns that say,\"In an emergency, push and hold door for fifteen seconds untildoors open.\"[Editor's note: There is a name for people who stand in theemergency doorway for fifteen seconds during a real emergency:\"flattened.\"]True Tale---I went to lunch with a new employee who was not familiar with thecity.   On the way back, he decided to stop at a bookstore.   Hourslater, my boss and I realized that he had not returned.   Fearingthe worst, we called down to our crack security guards and asked,\"If you needed to take someone to the hospital, where would youtake him?\"The guard asked me to hold.   A few minutes later he came back withthe official answer: \"the hospital.\"True Tale---When I received a check from my previous company for my 401Krollover, I noticed the date on the check was 1-18-1999, eventhough the check was written in January, 2000.   IRS regulationsdon't allow 401K rollovers that are more than 90 days old.   I wentto my former place of employment and pointed out the error to theHR Duhrector, who had originally written the check.   His solutionwas to cross out 1999 and write 2000 above it.   Then he initialedand dated the change... 1/25/999.True Tale---Here are some true phrases used by my boss:\"Ah, that's the flaw in the ointment.\"\"\"There's the gem in the haystack.\"\"\"We need to increase sales!   Let's throw some more wrenches in thefire!\"\"\"I believe that like I believe a hole in the head!\"True Tale---My office is near Orlando, FL.   An Induhvidual in my office noticedseveral people leaving the building.   She asked me, \"Where iseveryone going?\"   I told her we were going to watch the shuttlelaunch.   She asked, \"Is it outside?\"True Tale---I was buying a newspaper at the convenience store.   The clerk looksdown at the paper and says, \"Is that fifty cents or a dollar? I cannever remember.\"I pointed to the clearly-visible price of 50 cents printed on thecorner of the paper and said, \"Fifty cents. Who'd pay a dollar forthis paper?!?\"\"\"Oh, some people do,\" said the clerk.\"Really? Why?\"\"\"Because that's what I charge them.\"True Tale---My boss called me into his office.   While attaching a keyboard tohis computer, he asked if I would mind going to my desk and runninga particular program.   He needed the data right away and mycomputer was the only one set up for this particular function.I said that it was no problem and headed to my desk, only to findthat it was MY keyboard he had taken.True Tale---A bank recently sent a letter to its bankcard holders with somedetails about its new cards. The first line of the letter is a realwhopper:\"The year 2000 has come quicker than expected!\"[Editor's note: Customers of that bank might want to double-checktheir interest calculations.]True Tale---This conversation actually happened.   The names have been changedto protect the stupid.Jack: \"G.W. Bush is fairly attractive, especially for a man hisage.\"Jill: \"Yeah, I guess he's gotten better looking since he waspresident.\"Jack: \"Eh???\"Jill: \"I mean, he looks much younger than he did when he waspresident in '92.\"Jack: \"That's because it's HIS SON!\"[Editor's note:   After Dogbert takes over, Jill will be used as aknickknack on a very large shelf.]True Tale---Early in my career as an electrical engineer, I worked for theNavy.   One day a directive was sent to all employees informing us,\"Should you get killed or injured on the job, you are required tonotify your supervisor immediately.\"True Tale---True memo from a school principal:   Do you know if there is any way to adjust the volume on the   fire alarm? It is shrill and extremely loud.   If we could turn   the volume down some it would help.   Please advise,   Thanks,   &lt;PHB-Principal&lt;True Tale---In the dining hall at my school, a sign reads, \"At Cornell Dining,we want all your dining experiences to be successful.\"[Editor's note:   Maybe I'm twisted, but I have many images in myhead of what qualifies as \"unsuccessful dining\" and all of themseem funny to me.]True Tale---At our company we frequently need to discard empty boxes that won'tfit in trashcans.   The Induhvidual who picks up the trash ignoresanything outside the trashcan unless you tape a big sign on it thatsays \"TRASH.\"   This is very annoying but we've all gotten used to it.In a seemingly unrelated event, folks started thinking that weshould have a \"disaster plan\" just in case a tornado wipes out thebuilding. We were told to gather up copies of everything needed toput us back into business after a catastrophe.   Hundreds of boxesfull of documents were gathered together, categorized, inventoried,labeled and put near the dock for transportation to the undergroundcaves, where they would be safe. The Induhvidual who ignores ourempty trash boxes promptly threw them all out.True Tale---Our marketing director was nicknamed Axel. He decided to have adepartmental meeting to explain his new role after thereorganization.He compared the company to a car, and the various departments asthe wheels.   To finish off, he asked a question. \"So, what do youthink keeps the wheels attached to the car?\" He expected someone toshout \"The axle,\" relating to his own role and nickname. To hisannoyance, someone yelled out \"The nuts.\"True Tale---As I was being terminated, the VP asked that I not be too criticalof him in case he hadn't made the right choice in firing me. Thiswas an unpleasant experience for him. He also asked for myunderstanding because he might have to fire more people later inthe week.   In the company's management training, they stress theneed for empathy when letting an employee go. No doubt he missedthe part where they said empathy TOWARDS OTHERS.True Tale---I was having dinner recently at a nice restaurant and I asked thewaiter if the soup had meat in it.   His reply:   \"Not really.\"True Tale---I'm a Democrat but I voted in the Republican primary because I canin South Carolina.   While in line at the voting location I talkedto two married Induhviduals. One was voting for Bush and the otherfor McCain.   When I asked them if they weren't concerned that theirvotes would cancel each other out, the husband said, \"Well, wewouldn't normally even vote, but we wanted to come out and cancelout all those Democrats who were going to vote Republican today.\"Revenge Is A Dish Best Served to Someone Else---Approximately every ten minutes some @$$$hole gives out my publice-mail address instead of his or her own to an online store.People do this so they don't get deluged with junk mail.   Butonline stores are getting smarter.   They send confirmations to myaddress before initiating the service or mailing the product.   Theconfirmation letters often include information identifying theculprit.   Recently a Patricia White from Virginia ordered somemagazines online and used my e-mail address so I would get her junkmail.   I was more than happy to \"correct\" her name as it wouldappear on the shipping labels of her monthly magazines.Here was my response to the online store's confirmation request.Dear Sirs,re: Order Number: 16496863Please change my last name to my married name, as I will be usingthat more commonly.   Old name: Pat White   Change to New name: Pat McGroinThank you for your attention.   P. McGroinDogbert Answers My Mail---In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.   These are real e-mailmessages sent to me.   The names have been changed to make themeasier to mock.The first letter is from someone who objected to my strip in whichDogbert gave Ratbert a bumper sticker reading WWDD (What WouldDogbert Do).   It was inspired by the popular WWJD (What Would JesusDo) bumper stickers.   I thought I was mocking bumper stickerwisdom, not Christianity, but many readers felt differently.Dear Mr. Adams,I have long been a fan of Dilbert, but your strip of today wasworse than witless.   Your cartoon that mocks the WWJD slogan servesno purpose other than to profane.   You obviously had a case of IQcatatonia when you drew it.   Evidently, it spread to your editor aswell when you submitted it.   Keep it up and you'll be relegated tothe ash heap of once-trendy nitwits who didn't know the differencebetween humor and inflammatory idiocy.   Byron C.   AlabamaDear Boron,I'm glad you are committed to your philosophy of doing what Jesuswould do.   I assume that includes writing insulting letters tocartoonists on company time.   Apparently the bibles in Alabama havea few extra chapters.   If I were you, I wouldn't take too manysuggestions from the Book of Willy.   Sincerely,   Dogbert---(This message suspiciously had no greeting)You are an incredible talent, and I am always impressed by yourwork.Cutting to the chase, I have established a web site to help fund mycollege tuition. It is ww.justinduke.com.   If you like anythingyou see there, please send me a dime.If you like, tell your friends, thanks.   JustinDear Dustbin,If your web site sucks and your message to me is a poorly disguisedmass mailing, please send me a dime.   Sincerely,   Dogbert---Dear Mr. Adams,We are currently trying to raise money to buy new uniforms andinstruments for the Knoxville schools' music programs.   We areorganizing a celebrity auction, and would be greatly honored if youcould donate an autographed item or some other piece of memorabiliato help make our auction a success.Sincerely,Terry F.Vice-President Knoxville Music BoostersDear Hairy F.,I can think of no charitable cause more worthwhile than increasingthe supply of bad music in Knoxville. Unfortunately, Mr. Adams hasalready given away most of his possessions to other celebrityauctions.   It's slim pickings now.   But you could have his comb(rarely needed), his old toothbrush (in six months), and the holesin his socks.   Sincerely,   Dogbert---Dear Reader,Hello! I'm Avinash from Bombay, India. I'm 18 years old and ampresently in college. I require a currency note of any denominationfrom the United States of America or any Latin American country fora geography project that I'm presently working on. I would beextremely grateful if you could mail a note to my address whichI've written below. If you cannot, then thanks anyway for takingthe time to read my e-mail.   Avinash   Bombay, India.Dear Avinashwipe,This is an amazing coincidence.   I too am doing a project thatinvolves collecting currency from other countries.   After youfinish your project, maybe you could send the piles of money to mefor my project.   My project is a bit more ambitious than yours; I'mcollecting all of the currency from every country.   Sincerely,   DogbertDear Mr. Adams,I am in the midst of an argument and I need a fresh perspective andI figured that you had an opinion on everything, so... which camefirst, the freaking chicken or the egg?   GregoryDear Eggory,Put your finger in this hole.   Sincerely,   DogbertDilberito Update---Tip:   It's illegal and immoral to slay your enemies, but if you eatnutritious food and outlive them, you can still dance on theirgraves.

We are currently using the following country curves you provided previously:1)   Philippines:   9070002)   Thailand:   5150003)   Korea:   6230004)   China:   5090005)   Taiwan:   2080006)   US:   817000I agree in principal with the methodology and understand the approach, given the info you have.   However, you have just provided a new curve for Thailand, which, was just provided to us in May.   Given the methodolgy you explained earlier, I find it hard to believe we would see such a huge impact (35% decrease on a 25 year PV basis) on our COCO valuation (Thai project).   It appears that this Thai curve is not using PP, and I'm not saying your analysis has to be PP, but most would expect that given the varying economic environments and market places we deal with, PP is a widely accepted practice/method, as we cannot predict the future.   Please provide us a detailed reconcilation among the two curves and the Country rational in coming up with the revised curves from 4 months ago.Please contact me if you have any questions at 0111-852-25888-1234.Regards,Ramon\n"

To have a real-live 'configuration' of the system.If assets/routes/servers etc...are added - what is the impact on the 'value' of the system and what it's worth. John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know the VaR of your whole trading portfolio. However - I've not seen this done with a mixture of MTM &amp; accrual assets. Add the spice of a 'operational system' valuation   - and this will be tough to quantify and model.Step 1 - configure system and value it Step 2 - calculate a VaR on this. We will need to do some work here!Step 3 - calculate the incremental VaR of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc - tough...See what you think?B.\tJohn Echols\t06/28/000 05:41 PM \t\t\t To: Jim Fallon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Barry Pearce/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Lou Casari/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: PoliciesHere is a first rough draft of a \"value @ risk\" transaction policy.I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get some early thinking going on limits for the V@R.

The negotiated arrangement covers three separate capacity agreements.   The decision to release Enron from the three capacity agreements was somewhat   puzzling, given that Enron last week had asked to be let out of only one contract - the   famed Block II agreement (614 MMcf/d) - due to the restrictions that FERC had   placed on the delivery rights of the capacity. In a Jan. 27 letter, Enron notified El Paso   of its intent to exit the Block II contract, but the letter didn't indicate that it wanted to   terminate the Blocks I and II contracts. See Daily GPI, Feb. 3)   \"They asked for it [to be released] and we agreed to it. It was a mutual agreement,\"   said El Paso spokesman Mel Scott. The capacity agreements will be terminated on Jan.   31. Afterward, El Paso said it will hold open season from Feb. 7 to Feb. 14 for the   capacity.   \"It is unfortunate that the recent FERC order modified the capacity rights in a way that   will not allow the capacity to serve the purpose that Enron North America originally   intended when they outbid the prearranged transactions. In the interest of fairness and   good customer relations, we have agreed to release them from the contracts,\" said John   W. Somerhalder II, president of El Paso Energy's Pipeline Group.   El Paso Natural Gas has asked FERC to reconsider the mid-January order that   essentially has reduced the commercial value of the Block II firm transportation   capacity that Enron had agreed to acquire. With the collapse of its contract deal with   Enron, it couldn't be immediately determined whether El Paso will continue to pursue   rehearing.   El Paso is seeking rehearing after being rebuffed by FERC in its request to stay the   provision in the order restricting delivery rights of Block II capacity.   The pipeline is seeking a reversal of a decision in which FERC said El Paso's 19996   turned-back capacity settlement bars El Paso from marketing Block II capacity on a   primary basis to any delivery point other than the one at Pacific Gas &amp;   Electric-Topock, AZ. That ruling stripped the Block II capacity of primary delivery   access to the Southern California Gas-Topock delivery point, which is the most   sought-after by shippers of San Juan Basin gas.   It was a major blow to El Paso and Enron, which had contracted for the Block II   capacity in December on the condition that it would have primary delivery access to the   Southern California market...   Without a favorable decision on rehearing, \"the result may well be a diminution of the   value of Block II capacity,\" El Paso told FERC. \"Without question, Enron, as a new   shipper on the capacity\" and future holders of that capacity \"will suffer a disadvantage in   the market...\"   El Paso contends the Commission's ruling, if unchanged, would thwart the intent of the   19996 settlement, which called for the pipeline and its customers to share the risks of   unsubscribed capacity on El Paso's system, and for El Paso to share a portion of the   revenues it received from re-marketing the capacity.   \"An essential element in El Paso's ability to maximize the revenues it agreed to share   with its firm customers was the ability to market the 614 MMcf/d of Block II capacity   on a primary basis to delivery points other than PG&amp;E-Topock,\" the pipeline noted.   Stripping El Paso of delivery-point flexibility for Block II capacity \"will have a serious   adverse impact on [its] ability to generate the maximum possible revenues for its   capacity and thereby recover the costs it and its customers would otherwise have to   absorb.\"   El Paso further said the Commission's decision was at odds with a 19998 order   addressing whether the pipeline could re-market capacity turned back by PG&amp;E to the   SoCal-Topock delivery point on a primary basis. Since the 19996 settlement was silent   on whether El Paso could re-market the capacity to delivery points other than   PG&amp;E-Topock, the Commission reasoned the settlement didn't preclude El Paso from   selling the capacity at SoCal-Topock.   \"That ruling established the proper interpretation of the 19996 settlement. Now, the   Commission has re-interpreted that same provision in a manner that is completely   contrary to its previous ruling. The Commission provides no explanation as to how   these two rulings can be reconciled or, alternatively, why it has changed its mind...\"   El Paso said it was also seeking rehearing because it \"cannot find any evidence\" in the   mid-January order that the Commission \"even read, much less considered\" its response   as to the \"proper interpretation\" of the19996 settlement. \n"

We enjoyed speaking with you regarding your plans for=20\rtaking the classroom to the web and feel that there are numerous=20\ropportunities for Enron and UT to work together on this venture.=20\r As you requested, I am sending you additional information on the services=\r=20\rthat can be provided by Enron Broadband Services (EBS).   EBS offers two=20\rdistinct product offerings that could be provided to UT students. =20\r 1) EBS offers our customers a full spectrum of bandwidth services.   This=20\rincludes dark fiber, OCX-lambdas, DS3 and above circuits, and bandwidth=20\rmanagement solutions.   Our focus is to help the enterprise customer add val=\rue=20\rand flexibility to their bandwidth service needs with features such as=20\rbandwidth \"on demand\".   EBS owns over 18,000 miles of fiber optic cable tha=\rt=20\rprovides EBS with an extensive network in the USA and Canada. =20\r 2) Enron offers a full turn-key streaming media service called e PowerTM =\r=20\rMediaCast.   This service can involve the entire management of the entire=20\rprocess from filming through encoding, hosting and streaming or to supply t=\rhe=20\rspecific services that a client could need.   Each client   would access the=\rir=20\rclient's media through an URL embedded on the appropriate client=20\rwebsite(s).   The content can streamed live or stored to be played=20\ron-demand.   EBS can deliver the streams at bit rates from 20kbps to 1Mbps o=\rr=20\rhigher.   There are no additional resources (hardware, software or human)=20\rrequired by a client to use our product. =20\r Our current customers has found the superior quality of e PowerTM =20\rMediaCast.has improved their ability to deliver a clear corporate philosoph=\ry=20\rand increase their customer retention.   The e PowerTM   MediaCast Network ha=\rs=20\ra distributed server architecture supported by a private global fiber and=\r=20\rsatellite network (a pure Internet Protocol strategy) with embedded softwar=\re=20\rintelligence that sets it apart from other network providers. The EBS e pow=\rer=20\rTM private network has dedicated servers in over 2000 cities in the USA and=\r=20\rCanada. After the service is initiated, each client   can   access to reporti=\rng=20\rof the viewership statistics for your content on the EBS Intranet Site=20\r(ww.epoweronline.com) that is updated on a daily basis.   Each client is=20\rprovided with a User ID and Password.   EBS guarantees their customers a=20\rsuperior quality of service level.   =20\r Our customers have found three major benefits.   First, Enron stores our=20\rclients' content on our servers which reduces the strain on clients' centra=\rl=20\rservers and Website.   Second, Enron constantly monitors its clients' sites=\r=20\rand updates its servers regularly to keep the data fresh.   Finally, Enron=\r=20\rsharply cuts the time it takes a viewer to receive our clients' content by=\r=20\rdelivering the media across Enron's private network and with the use of=20\rsoftware (bandwidth operating system) that decides within milliseconds whic=\rh=20\rEnron server can deliver the fastest.   To do that Enron servers, which=20\rdeliver our customer=01,s content, are located in over 2000 cities in the US=\r and=20\rCanada.   This places your content close to the end user (typically, \"one-ho=\rp\"=20\raway), and allows up to 5000,000 simultaneous viewers at any time.   This=20\renables high quality, rich media to be streamed without delay and congestio=\rn=20\rto an end user's desktop.   In fact, Enron recently announced plans to insta=\rll=20\r18,000 of our media servers (Compaq and Sun) into our global Data Centers=\r=20\rover a three year time period to extend our service domestically and=20\rinternationally.\r We offer two internet sites to browse that demonstrates the true TV-like=20\rexperience of the e PowerTM   MediaCastexperience. =20\r   1) http:///www.enron.net/mediacast   =20\r a) User name and login ID are both   -   epower4.=20\r   2) http:///www.enron.net/finance/srv_demo/enron/ms1250.html\r   a) Once you are at this page called Today's Feature - click on the ACME TV=\r=20\rand chose one of the channels\r b) Chose the speed of your video player (either REAL or WindowsMedia Playe=\rr)\r c) Hit the play arrow button on the \"Screen\" that pops\r   Finally, I estimate the cost per student to stream the course would be=20\rapproximately $75.000.   Please remember this price is for the streaming only=\r,=20\rand is priced on a per MB delivered basis.   In addition, there will be a fl=\rat=20\rmonthly charge to administer the program.   Production and encoding can be=\r=20\rprovided at an additional cost.   Therefore, if the stream rates in my=20\rassumptions listed below change, our pricing will change slightly.   As you=\r=20\rwill see the cost for the streaming would be a minimal and would not prohib=\rit=20\rthe students from taking the course on-line.   I apologize that we do not ha=\rve=20\rany example distance learning clips that we are able to share with you at=\r=20\rthis time.   However, I would be happy to demonstrate our capabilities to yo=\ru=20\ron your desktop, if you are interested.=20\r I look forward to discussing with you in greater detail how either of these=\r=20\rservices could be used to expand the reach of the University and its course=\r=20\rofferings.   I will contact your office at the beginning of next week to=\r=20\rcontinue this discussion.   If you would like to contact me prior to next=20\rweek, please do not hesitate to call me at 713 853-3242.   =20\r Sincerely,\r Traci Warner\rDirector, Central Region Origination\rEnron Broadband Services\rPhone (713) 853-3242\rCell (713) 705-7201\r   Price Quote Assumptions:\r1000 Students enrolled\r30 hours of course work per semester\r Encode at 4 rates - 28K, 56K, 1000K, 3000K\r # of students per viewing rate:\r15% at 28K\r40% at 56K\r25% at 1000K\r20% at 3000K\r   \n"

Aswe have 10 interview rooms available to us and as on 111/3 we currently havenine rooms booked, if Enron wants to move all 8 schedules to 111/3, weprobably will not be able to host them on-campus unless [the firm currentlyholding the rooms] moves off (and there is a possibility of that - this islike a game of dominos).   However, Enron could interview off campus, butthat is not as convenient for the students and it increases the cost for theemployer.   If Enron wants to move only one or two schedules to 111/3 for justComp Finance, we would find a way to accomodate them.   Our RecruitingCoordinator, Sally Gould, will do everything she can to make this work forEnron.   Please suggest that Enron re-contact her as soon as they know whattheir preferences are.

Please, take a look at the information about a meeting last Sunday at Stanford University. The web site address is   given below. My wife went tothe presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40 people attended.2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to write jointly anacademic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an article on EBS.I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company Reinventing Itself.I made a few points to John:a. Enron's evolution did not just happen   by accident.It was a result of implementation of a far-reachingstrategy developed by the management.b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up with a term\"proactive evolution\", as opposed to \"reactive evolution.\"c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the qualityof human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employeempowerment.d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and accomplishemnts.The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate strategyand would help greatly our recruiting efforts. Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key players. Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.Vince---"

If you had to identify, in one word, the reason why the human race has   not achieved, and never will achieve, its full potential, that word   would be \"meetings\".   There is a very fine line between \"hobby\" and \"mental illness.\"   People who want to share their religious views with you almost never   want you to share yours with them.   And when God, who created the entire universe with all of its glories,   decides to deliver a message to humanity, He WILL NOT use, as His   messenger, a person on cable TV with a bad hairstyle.   You should not confuse your career with your life.   No matter what happens ... somebody will find a way to take it too   seriously.   When trouble arises &amp; things look bad, there is always individual who   perceives a solution &amp; is willing to take command. Very often, that   person is crazy.   Nobody cares if you can't dance well.   Just get up and dance.   A person who is nice to you, but rude to the waiter, is not a nice   person.   Never lick a steak knife.   Take out the fortune before you eat the cookie.   \"The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender,   religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down   inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.   You should never say anything to a woman that evenremotely suggests that   you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from   her at that moment.   Your friends love you anyway. - att1.unk\n"

Carriershave been leasing capacity from each other for decades and ISPs havebeen setting up private peering connections with each other forseveral years, so the concept of using each other's bandwidth is notnew.But Enron has set up a system that's based primarily on Lucent networkmanagement gear, which Enron claims will allow it to do two importantthings: Guarantee performance over multiple net-works; and changecircuits in a matter of seconds, as opposed to days or months.Today, when carriers buy capacity from each other, they ink deals thatsometimes span 20 years. But Enron plans on changing that. Thecompany's idea is to treat bandwidth as a commodity. Instead ofsigning a 20-year deal, the carrier signs up with carrier ABC becauseit is offering a competitively low rate on T-3 connections for thatmonth. But next month carrier XYZ is expected to lower its rates, sothe carrier then switches its circuits from ABC to XYZ.Enron has the capability to change circuits every five seconds, says TomGros, vice president of global trading at Enron. So the idea is thatcarriers are going to be able to get high-quality bandwidth at reducedrates. Nothing wrong with that idea, but a few questions come up.One: Will your carrier or ISP share those savings with you, the businesscustomer? Well, that's hard to say. This is a difficult question toanswer because most Enron's \"intermediation\" partner deals areconfidential. Global Crossings, a wholesale carrier, is the only dealthat's been announced because it was Enron's first.So chances are you won't even know if your carrier is working withEnron, who claims several other carriers are in fact working withthem.Two: Doesn't constant circuit changes bring up monitoring issues forbusiness users? Gros says it should not, and in fact end users shouldexpect even better monitoring capabilities. Now while En-ron very wellmight provide its carrier and ISP partners with high-end monitoringtools, I would take the position that it's highly unlikely thatcarriers are going to make those tools available to their cus-tomers.Why? Well the answer gets back to the first issue. If all of the dealsare confidential, end us-ers aren't going to even know their circuitsare getting switched around.Would you want to know if your carrier or ISP is participating inbandwidth trading?To contact Denise Pappalardo:---Denise Pappalardo is a senior editor for Network World, covering ISPs,VPNs and related topics.

Eleven were merchants, nine werefarmers and large plantation owners; men of means, well educated. But theysigned the Declaration of Independence knowing full well that the penaltywould be death if they were captured.Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his shipsswept from the seas by the British Navy.   He sold his home and properties topay his debts, and died in rags.Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the British that he was forced to move hisfamily almost constantly. He served in the Congress without pay, and hisfamily was kept in hiding. His possessions were taken from him, and povertywas his reward.Vandals or soldiers looted the properties of Dillery, Hall, Clymer, Walton,Gwinnett, Heyward, Rutledge, and Middleton.At the battle of Yorktown, Thomas Nelson Jr, noted that the British GeneralCornwallis had taken over the Nelson home for his headquarters.   He quietlyurged General George Washington to open fire. The home was destroyed, andNelson died bankrupt.Francis Lewis had his home and properties destroyed.   The enemy jailed hiswife, and she died within a few months.John Hart was driven from his wife's bedside as she was dying. Their 13children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid towaste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home tofind his wife dead and his children vanished. A few weeks later he died fromexhaustion and a broken heart.Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates.Such were the stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These werenot wild-eyed, rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft-spoken men of meansand education. They had security, but they valued liberty more.   Standingtall, straight, and unwavering, they pledged: \"For the support of thisdeclaration, with firm reliance on the protection of the divine providence,we mutually pledge to each other, our lives, our fortunes, and our sacredhonor.\"They gave you and me a free and independent America.   The history booksnever told you a lot about what happened in the Revolutionary War.   Wedidn't fight just the British. We were British subjects at that time and wefought our own government!Some of us take these liberties so much for granted, but we shouldn't.   So,take a few minutes while enjoying your 4th of July holiday and silentlythank these patriots. It's not much to ask for the price they paid.Remember: freedom is never free!   Patriotism is NOT a sin, and the Fourth ofJuly has more to it than beer, picnics, and baseball games.something to think about...\n"

Aug. 31, 2000) - Phillip Harris, Chairman and CEO of PJM&lt; Interconnection, LLC, North America's largest centrally-dispatched electrical&lt; system, testified before the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission this week&lt; on the reliability and affordability of electricity in the state.&lt;&lt; PJM, which became the first fully operational Independent System Operator in&lt; the U.S. on January 1, 19998 is responsible for the reliability of the bulk&lt; power transmission system and to facilitate an open, competitive wholesale&lt; electric market.&lt;&lt; PJM is responsible for coordinating the transmission of more than 58,000&lt; Megawatts of electricity over 8,000 miles of power lines it uses to get power&lt; from 540 generating stations to more than 24 million customers.&lt;&lt; The Interconnection serves 8 percent of the country's population, which is&lt; spread throughout the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware and&lt; northern Virginia region. PJM is the third largest entity of its kind in the&lt; world, behind Tokyo Electric and France's grid-the whole country.&lt;&lt; PJM's duties also entail administration of the energy market, which now takes&lt; place over the Internet. The commodities-like exchange is facilitated by PJM's&lt; custom-built eBusiness tools. Technological and process innovation have&lt; enabled PJM to manage more than $4 billion in the energy market in the past&lt; three years, achieve a 96 percent customer approval rating and has secured the&lt; reliability of grid through peak demand days.&lt;&lt;   In his testimony, Harris outlined the underlying principles of why PJM has&lt; been successful in the new energy marketplace:&lt;&lt;&lt; -more-&lt; 2/3&lt;&lt; Transition Process&lt;&lt; Moving from a government regulated entity to a deregulated market model is a&lt; complicated process. PJM took an incremental and methodical approach to&lt; deregulation by taking measured steps and evaluating the results of the&lt; transition after each step to ensure reliability of the existing services.&lt; What is now a five-market system, began with a single market and was phased in&lt; over two years.&lt;&lt; Governance Model&lt;&lt; To ensure fairness in the market, PJM chartered a two-tier governance model&lt; that includes a fully independent board that is supported by advice from a&lt; Members Committee.&lt; The model provides a forum for member debate and a process to develop&lt; collaborative solutions. PJM's more than 2000 members as well as stakeholders&lt; can have a voice and confidence that change to business rules will occur&lt; fairly, collaboratively, and efficiently.&lt;&lt; Power Exchange Function&lt; The success of the PJM Power Pool and the continued combination of the&lt; reliability and market functions within the new PJM ISO were the most&lt; efficient and cost effective transition to the future.&lt;&lt; The connection of both functions within one organization, that is financially&lt; independent of both transmission and generation facilities, system&lt; modifications and market innovations required to assure reliability can move&lt; forward quickly and efficiently, without artificial barriers to&lt; implementation.&lt;&lt; Long-Term Reliability&lt;&lt; The reliability of the grid and the market is dependent upon the free flow of&lt; information to PJM members and stakeholders.&lt; Using tools like the eData application, PJM members can view Real Time Energy&lt; Market prices on public Internet pages every five minutes for approximately&lt; 2,000 hubs, zones, and significant locations throughout the PJM region. The&lt; information-rich environment has initially drawn the interest of 30,000&lt; additional Megawatts of capacity to join the PJM region, which translates into&lt; greater reliability.&lt;&lt; -more-&lt; 3/3&lt;&lt; Transmission Expansion Process&lt;&lt; PJM is increasing the services it provides to the growing economy and the&lt; population. Competition, growth and reliability of the market and grid is&lt; further aided by a well-planned, FERC-approved expansion process that&lt; anticipates an additional 15,000 Megawatts added to the PJM region over the&lt; next five years.&lt; An additional 20,000 Megawatts are planned to be added in the future, ensuring&lt; an abundant pool of power to meet increasing demand.&lt;&lt; Collaborative Process&lt;&lt; The innovative two-tier governance for PJM and management of the grid and&lt; market includes all stakeholders, regulators and traders and provides a forum&lt; other groups to be part collective collaborative membership process.&lt;&lt; Needs of the Customer&lt;&lt; PJM is attentive to making the system responsive to the changing needs of the&lt; customer. New internet-based tools and five different markets provide PJM&lt; members with flexibility to create a portfolio of transactions to best suit&lt; their dynamic needs.&lt;&lt; The eSuite of tools (eFTR, eDocuments, eSchedules, eCapacity, eData) and PJM&lt; Open Access Same-Time Information System (OASIS) empower members and&lt; stakeholders with the information they need to make informed decisions about&lt; their power needs and policies.&lt;&lt; These tools provide the public with valuable information such as market&lt; pricing, daily load, transmission system information and much more. The&lt; openness of the information exchange ensures fair conduct of the market.&lt;&lt; Continuous Improvement&lt;&lt; Innovation is the key to successfully managing the diverse interests of PJM's&lt; rapidly increasing membership. Additional Internet tools are in development to&lt; support its evolving role as an Independent System Operator.&lt;&lt; More information on PJM and the energy market can be found at PJM's website:&lt; ww.pjm.com&lt;&lt;&lt; ###&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Sincerely,&lt;&lt; Cynthia Taylor&lt; Manager, Customer Relations and Training&lt; PJM Interconnection, L.L.C.&lt;Please DO NOT REPLY to this message.

Degen, chairman of The New England Gas Association, and chairman,president and chief executive officer of Valley Gas Company, based inCumberland, Rhode Island, said: \"The interest in natural gas has never beenstronger in New England. We look forward to continued growth in the yearsahead, to bring reliable, efficient, and cost-effective natural gas tohomes and businesses throughout the region.\"This growth in New England is reflected in such developments as:* A 25% growth in the region's pipeline infrastructure over the last year:--- two new pipelines from Canada - the Portland Natural Gas TransmissionSystem (PNGTS), and the Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline from NovaScotia;--- system expansions by the region's transmission and local distributioncompanies;* A new supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Caribbean:--- the Cabot LNG Corporation's Atlantic LNG Project made firstdeliveries to New England in May 1999;--- LNG deliveries to New England in 1999 were more than double 19998levels;* There are more natural gas customers in New England than ever before:--- NEGA reports that New England now has over 2.2 million natural gascustomers, from homeowners to small and large businesses;--- The region's gas utilities reached a new record sendout of gas onJanuary 17, 2000, reaching 3.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf), a 13%increase over the previous record.\"Over the past year,\" said Degen, \"the New England natural gas industryinstalled more new miles of pipelines than it has in decades. Whole areasof New England are gaining access to gas for the first time, and the restof the region is receiving substantial new supplies as well.\"The Conference was attended by more than 3000 industry and governmentofficials. In his keynote address, Gary L. Neale, chairman, president andCEO of NiSource, Inc., and chairman of the American Gas Association(A.G.A.), reported on the national natural gas market projections found inA.G.A.'s recent study, \"Fueling the Future.\" Neale noted that increasednatural gas demand has multiple national benefits, including:environmental, energy security, trade, and economic development.NEGA, based in Needham, Massachusetts, was established in 1926. Itsmembership includes all of New England's local natural gas utilities, theinterstate pipeline companies, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, andover 280 associate member companies. The natural gas utilities serve over2.2 million customers in 490 communities in New England.\n"

He comes from MCI where he was responsible for modeling traffic etc.   It   appears that Sycamore finally got him.   One time they had lost him to Corvis (another optical equipment company), I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal!   As soon as this guy is available, I'll set up an all day technical meeting to hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development is concerned.   I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly outline what needs to be done to support dynamic, optical-switched-circuits based trading and streaming media applications, etc.   Having such an industry expert help us will help 'justify' internally all the the effort on the traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support.   Keep in mind that even though he is an expert in the field, the field that we need to play in has not develop yet. Even the emerging data based traffic (as opposed to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed) analysis is an order of magnitude more difficult (due to uncertain load), let alone trading such load (which we are planning to do!).   Ravi... Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on thedesign/planning piece of the business.   He will be contracted out to Enronfor a period of 6 months initially.   He lives in SF but will be traveling towhereever you need him.   Jim, Griebling wanted us to set up a meetingbetween you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.

Perhaps you've created an expense report\rtemplate in Excel that has the fields your accounting department is\rinterested in.\r But if you want to really impress the users, how about templates which\rautomatically populate themselves with user data (names, departments,\retc.)? If you've got NetWare 4.x or 5.x and use Microsoft Office, you\rcan do that - quickly, easily and (best of all) for free.\r Novell Directory Services-Enabled Office is a tool for automating the\rtask of filling in standard forms with user and departmental data from\ryour NDS directory. It=01,s based on ActiveX controls and uses Visual\rBasic scripts to feed that data into your forms.\r To use NDS-Enabled Office, you must create Microsoft Word or Excel\rtemplates that contain Visual Basic script macros that call users=01, NDS\rdata, such as their names or departments. You can then send your\rtemplates to any employee in the company, and when the employee opens\rthe template, the document will be filled in automatically with that\remployee's NDS information.\r The NDS-Enabled Office installation includes sample templates. One is a\rWord fax template, and the other is an Excel expense report template.\r It saves paper, saves employees' time and it=01,s free. What are you\rwaiting for?\r To contact Dave Kearns:\r---\rDave Kearns is the Word Wrangler for Virtual Quill, a writing agency\rserving the computer and networking industries.

It is not intended to be acommercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercialdecision-making.   Conceptually, it is a risk warehouse for the primary purposeof RAC due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems and theirinability to provide timely, aggregated information useful to RAC.RAC has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed tasklist to accomplish its objectives.   As a firm we are woefully behind our pressclippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile.   My mostrecent sojorn   in Europe is a classic example of the current systems inabilty toaggregate and meet the needs of RAC having abetted poor decision making andcausing cash losses in well in excess of the GRMS budget or that of the MarketRisk Group in RAC.The GRMS project is a requirement that Bill Bradford and I have in order to doour jobs.   We have delegated authority to Debbie Brackett and Rudi Zipter tomake decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with Jonathon andhis team as well as Rick Buy to provide updates.   While progress is never asfast as we would like it, in every instance in which we have only to rely onRAC, Jonathon's team and Research to make a deadline it haas been hit.   Theprimary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of resources offthe project or the reliance for cooperation from some other source - mostrecently the IT staff in London was a tremendous impediment to deadlines.Please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note,but I feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening.Also, I have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration onthe lack of management support for this project, usually manifesting itself inthe lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it.I think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphaseproject and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted.   Please let us doour jobs.   I do not denigrate the efforts of others, but I believe that theymust either submit their detailed requirements to us for our consideration oftheir worthiness to put in OUR que or develop their own project with their ownresources.Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.   As it relates to things thatwill effect the ability of Market Risk to do its job, please consult me as Iwould you.Ted\n"

Thiswill be used on our website and be published later in time.Could you please - if you have the time - contact and maybe work with Bijoya todraft this White Paper? Bryan is in Houston today and may be able to give abetter idea of what he is exactly looking for ... Otherwise, he will be inLondon again next week.I thank you in advance, and hope that we can pull something together in the nextfew weeks.Please contact me at any time!Regards from LondonKatja\n"

Also, each state hasits own set of regulations - known as\"blue sky laws.\"   Thus, before a companycan sell stock in particular state, thesecurities must be \"blue skied.\"   The originof the phrase comes from the late 18000s,when a judge compared an IPO to the valueof a section of the blue sky./---ADVERTISEMENT---Purchase Business/Credit Reports from Dun &amp; Bradstreeton over 111 million U.S. businesses.

(ARBA) helps manufacturers like DuPont anddistributors like FedEx streamline purchasing withprocurement software, but corporate insiders have beendoing far more selling than buying of their company'sstock.A rash of insiders have filed Form 1444 in recent days,weeks and months, notably co-founder and Chief FinancialOfficer Edward Kinsey. On June 6, he filed to sell 90,000shares valued at $5.0 million, or $555 a share, throughMorgan Stanley Dean Witter, lead underwriter of Ariba'sIPO one year ago. May 30 he filed to sell 1000,000 sharesfor $7 million, and May 18 the Kinsey Family Foundationfiled to sell 14,000 shares for $1.1 million.Marketing vice president David Rome filed to sell 150,000shares for $10.5 million on May 30. Robert D. Lent, vicepresident for corporate development, filed May 24 to sell2000,000 shares for $14.3 million.The sales come long after Ariba's price peaked at $183.34in early March, before the Nasdaq Stock Market plunged amidthe fallout over rising interest rates and concern aboutsoaring valuations. Back then insiders, who began to sellimmediately after the six-month lock-up on their sharesexpired, were reaping far more from their sales: Rome, forexample, indicated in a February 1 filing he would sell2000,000 shares for $35 million.Business-to-business is regarded as the hottest of theInternet's hot spots, and Ariba as a leader in its niche.The insider sales are tiny in comparison with the company's235.8 million outstanding shares, but they make a dent inthe float --- more than two-thirds of Ariba's stock is ownedby insiders and institutions.Recent Ariba filings:Prakoon &amp; Emily I.

Never take a beer to a job interview.&lt; &lt; 2. Always identify people in your yard before shooting squirrels.&lt; &lt; 3. It's considered tacky to take a cooler to church.&lt; &lt; 4. If you have to vacuum the bed, it is time to change the sheets.&lt; &lt; 5. Even if you're certain that you are included in the will, it is&lt; &lt; still considered improper to drive a U-Haul to the funeral home.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; DINING OUT&lt; &lt; 1. When decanting wine, make sure that you tilt the paper cup, and pour&lt; &lt; slowly so as not to \"bruise\" the fruit of the vine.&lt; &lt; 2. If drinking directly from the bottle, always hold it with your&lt; &lt; fingers covering the label.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; ENTERTAINING IN YOUR HOME&lt; &lt; 1. A centerpiece for the table should never be anything prepared by a&lt; &lt; taxidermist.&lt; &lt; 2. Do not allow the dog to eat at the table...no matter how good his&lt; &lt; manners are.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; PERSONAL HYGIENE&lt; &lt; 1. While ears need to be cleaned regularly, this is a job that should&lt; &lt; be done in private using one's OWN truck keys.&lt; &lt; 2. Proper use of toiletries can forestall bathing for several days.&lt; &lt; However, if you live alone, deodorant is not a waste of good money.&lt; &lt; 3. Dirt and grease under the fingernails is a social no-no, as they&lt; &lt; tend to detract from a woman's jewelry and alter the taste of finger&lt; &lt; foods.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; DATING (Outside the Family)&lt; &lt; 1. Always offer to bait your date's hook, especially on the first date.&lt; &lt; 2. Be aggressive. Let her know you're interested:   \"I've been wanting&lt; &lt; to go out with you since I read that stuff on the bathroom wall two&lt; years&lt; &lt; ago.\"&lt; &lt; 3. Establish with her parents what time she is expected back. Some will&lt; &lt; say 10:000 PM; Others might say \"Monday.\" If the latter is the answer, it&lt; &lt; is the man's responsibility to get her to school on time.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; THEATER ETIQUETTE&lt; &lt; 1. Crying babies should be taken to the lobby and picked up immediately&lt; &lt; after the movie has ended.&lt; &lt; 2. Refrain from talking to characters on the screen. Tests have proven&lt; &lt; they can't hear you.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; WEDDINGS&lt; &lt; 1. Livestock, usually, is a poor choice for a wedding gift.&lt; &lt; 2. Kissing the bride for more than 5 seconds may get you shot.&lt; &lt; 3. For the groom, at least, rent a tux. A leisure suit with a&lt; &lt; cummerbund and a clean bowling shirt can create an unappealing&lt; appearance.&lt; &lt; 4. Though uncomfortable, say \"yes\" to socks and shoes for this special&lt; &lt; occasion.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; DRIVING ETIQUETTE&lt; &lt; 1. Dim your headlights for approaching vehicles; Even if the gun is&lt; &lt; loaded, and the deer is in sight.&lt; &lt; 2. When approaching a four-way stop, the vehicle with the largest tires&lt; &lt; always has the right of way.&lt; &lt; 3. Never tow another car using panty hose and duct tape.&lt; &lt; 4. When sending your wife down the road with a gas can, it is impolite&lt; &lt; to ask her to bring back beer.&lt; &lt; 5. Do not lay rubber while traveling in a funeral procession.&lt; &lt; 6. Do not mend mufflers with bubble-gum if your truck back-fires&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

From a Southwest Airlines employee... \"There may be 50&lt; ways to leave your lover, but there are only 4 ways out of&lt; this airplane...\"&lt;&lt; 2. Pilot-\"Folks, we have reached our cruising altitude now,&lt; so I am going to switch the seat belt sign off. Feel free to&lt; move about as you wish, but please stay inside the plane till&lt; we land...it's a bit cold outside, and if you walk on the&lt; wings it affects the flight pattern.\"&lt;&lt; 3. After landing: \"Thank you for flying Delta Business&lt; Express. We hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much&lt; as we enjoyed taking you for a ride.&lt;&lt; 4. As the plane landed and was coming to a stop at Washington&lt; National, a lone voice comes over the loudspeaker: \"Whoa, big&lt; fella. WHOA!\"&lt;&lt; 5. After a particularly rough landing during thunderstorms in&lt; Memphis, a flight attendant on a Northwest flight announced:&lt; \"Please take care when opening the overhead compartments&lt; because, after a landing like that, sure as hell everything&lt; has shifted.\"&lt;&lt; 6. From a Southwest Airlines employee... \"Welcome aboard&lt; Southwest Flight XX to YY. To operate your seatbelt, insert&lt; the metal tab into the buckle, and pull tight. It works just&lt; like every other seatbelt and if you don't know how to&lt; operate one, you probably shouldn't be out in public&lt; unsupervised. In the event of a sudden loss of cabin pressure,&lt; oxygen masks will descend from the ceiling. Stop screaming,&lt; grab the mask, and pull it over your face. If you have a&lt; small child traveling with you, secure your mask before&lt; assisting with theirs. If you are traveling with two small&lt; children, decide now which one you love more.&lt;&lt; 7. Weather at our destination is 50 degrees with some broken&lt; clouds, but they'll try to have them fixed before we arrive.&lt; Thank you, and remember, nobody loves you or your money, more&lt; than Southwest Airlines.\"&lt;&lt; 8. \"Your seat cushions can be used for flotation and in the&lt; event of an emergency water landing, please take them with&lt; our compliments.\"&lt;&lt; 9. \"As you exit the plane, please make sure to gather all&lt; of your belongings. Anything left behind will be distributed&lt; evenly among the flight attendants. Please do not leave&lt; children or spouses.\"&lt;&lt; 10. \"Last one off the plane must clean it.\"&lt;&lt; 111. From the pilot during his welcome message: \"We are pleased&lt; to have some of the best flight attendants in the industry...&lt; Unfortunately none of them are on this flight...!&lt;&lt; 12. Overheard on an American Airlines flight into Amarillo,&lt; Texas, on a particularly windy and bumpy day. During the final&lt; approach, the Captain was really having to fight it After an&lt; extremely hard landing, the Flight Attendant came on the PA&lt; and announced, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Amarillo.&lt; Please remain in your seats with your seatbelts fastened while&lt; the Captain taxis what's left of our airplane to the gate!\"&lt;&lt; 13. Another flight Attendant's comment on a less than perfect&lt; landing:&lt; \"We ask you to please remain seated as Captain Kangaroo bounces&lt; us to the terminal.\"&lt;&lt; 14. An airline pilot wrote that on this particular flight he&lt; had hammered his ship into the runway really hard. The airline&lt; had a policy which required the first officer to stand at the&lt; door while the passengers exited, smile, and give them a&lt; \"Thanks for flying XYZ airline.\" He said that in light of his&lt; bad landing, he had a hard time looking the passengers in the&lt; eye, thinking that someone would have a smart comment. Finally,&lt; everyone had gotten off except for this little old lady walking&lt; with a cane. She said, \"Sonny, mind if I as you a question?\"&lt; \"Why no, Ma'am,\" said the pilot, \"what is it?\" The little old&lt; lady said, \"Did we land or were we shot down?\"&lt;&lt; 15. After a real crusher of a landing in Phoenix, the Flight&lt; Attendant came on with, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, please remain in&lt; your seats until Captain Crash and the Crew have brought the&lt; aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate. And, once&lt; the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silenced,&lt; we'll open the door and you can pick your way through the&lt; wreckage to the terminal.&lt;&lt; 16. Part of a Flight Attendant's arrival announcement: \"We'd&lt; like to thank you folks for flying with us today. And, the next&lt; time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in&lt; a pressurized metal tube, we hope you'll think of us here at&lt; US Airways.\"\n"

Consistent with these objectives and with the corporate goal offostering ?One Enron?, we would like to announce the following organizationalchanges in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the Commercial Transactions Groupwithin ENA.1) Coverage/Origination:To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and producttechnology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream businesses,the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated under theleadership of Dave Delainey :   a)   the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination   groups which focus on energy, finance and power development solutions   for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service   companies and IPP?s;   b)   the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on   delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy   industrial customers including   pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics,   refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial   gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing the   Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which   focus on energy, finance and industries.Downstream Coverage/OriginationAs energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that theheavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA andEnron Corp.   Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand itsindustrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions byhaving a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp.   Against thisbackdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its productoffering to include not only ENA?s existing energy commodities, energy services,finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES?s energyoutsourcing capability and Global Fuel?s chemicals, plastics and refinedproducts risk management capability.   These additional capabilities will beoffered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size andimportance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from Portlandto manage this business. Under Greg?s leadership, the Downstream Originationeffort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of theseindustries and our product offering:   a)   Pulp and Paper ? Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the   coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be   responsible for the provision of innovative   products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the   provision of paper risk management products;   b)   Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products ? We have asked Jim   Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business.   This group   will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and   services in the chemicals and refined products industries;   c)   Non-Integrated Industrials ? Bruce Garner, formerly leader of   Bankers Trust?s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA   to lead the coverage activities in this business.   This group will be   responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for   the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases,   fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing   industries.Midstream Coverage/Origination   a)   Eastern Coverage/Origination ? This group? activities will focus   on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas   utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the   Eastern Interconnect. We have asked   Janet Dietrich to assume the   leadership of this group;   b)   Western Coverage/Origination ? This group?s activities will   focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric   and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in   the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities   (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S.   We have asked   Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris will   relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian   downstream origination efforts;   c)   IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination ? This group?s activities will   focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions   for the emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio?s   of merchant power generation either through development or acquisition.   We have asked   Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.   In   addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development activities   in the Eastern Interconnect;   d)   Eastern QF Restructuring ? This group will focus on the QF   restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the   existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power   assets.   We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this   business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia?s development group, Doug   Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of   Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business.2) Commercial Transactions:The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and JeffDonahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution oftransactions within ENA ? and thereby, improve ENA?s efficiency in executingtransactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity ofclient coverage.   CTG consists of six primary functions: TransactionDevelopment, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity Structuringand Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis andUpstream Asset Management.The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction withthe originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which willbe dedicated to between two and four origination groups.   This dedication tospecific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greateraccountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources aredesigned to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest valuetransactions across the coverage functions:   a)   Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the   Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups.   The senior members of   this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ   Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 19992.   Most recently, he was the   Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ   Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with   responsibilities for power origination.   b)   Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA?s   industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and   Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries   as coverage is established.   The senior members of this team include   Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.   We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team within   the next few weeks.   c)   Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP   Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring   groups.   The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy   Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in   19996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the   Latin American group in Azurix.   We anticipate announcing two more   additions to this team within the next few weeks.   d)   Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the   Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.   The senior members of   this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.   We hope to   announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream andDownstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primaryresponsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.   Andrea Reed willcontinue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all juniorcommercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dualresponsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the CapitalStructuring Group.   The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largelyunchanged.   In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teamsand their respective origination groups will be located together.We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage andindustry knowledge in all ENA?s markets particularly in the industrial markets.It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between theCoverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in NorthAmerica by working with us to implement these changes. - pic13759.pcx\n"

Invensys is a Honeywell competitor, and Honeywell fans had\rbeen looking at the company's controls group for signs of strength this\rquarter. Got a bunch of angry email, in response, telling me I must be\ra kook (or actually, something much worse ) because just a few weeks\rago Honeywell said it was comfortable with earnings estimates of 76\rcents per share, which would be a pleasant 10% gain.\r True, but this is, after all, the same Honeywell that in June gave\rexpectations of one thing for second-quarter revenues, only to amend\rthat a few weeks later with a lower number. And this is, after all, the\rsame Honeywell that several quarters ago said it would take no more big\rcharges, and then turned around and took a whole bunch of new charges.\r Will the same thing happen this time round? Hard to say, and as of\rFriday all a Honeywell spokesman would say to me was: \"We're sticking\rwith our guidance.\" On earnings, that is. Interestingly (and subtly)\rHoneywell didn't say anything about revenues in its recent update, and\rthe spokesman said there will be no revenue guidance now, either. Stung\ronce, too smart to be stung twice, I guess.\r But that also highlights that Honeywell has entered the quarter with\rnegative revenue momentum, which is not what Wall Street wants to see.\rEarnings can meet estimates lots of different ways (an item here back\rin March showed how half of Honeywell's 20% earnings gain came from\rpension income) but revenue represents business in the raw.\r So, why worry now? According to one longtime Honeywell watcher, who\rprefers to go incognito (so he can protect his relationship with the\rcompany, in which he still holds a small stake), events that could\rfurther effect this quarter's earnings and revenues include the sharp\rrise in oil prices --- the same rise in oil prices that last week helped\rclobber DuPont (DD:NYSE), which warned of lower earnings (thanks, in\rpart, to oil). Honeywell also disclosed that problems with brakes it\rmakes for buses will shave 2 cents per share off earnings. The warning\rcame after the earnings reassurance a couple of weeks ago, but was\rincluded in the recent forecast. It's unclear, however, how the\rproblems will affect brake sales (and therefore revenues), going\rforward. Oh, and Honeywell is laying off 5% of its workforce. (A\rsupposed growth company firing people?!) Then there are more charges,\rlots of charges --- but the 76 cent per share number excludes them.\r What's more, analysts are just starting to take a close look at the\rcompany now that they're back from summer vacation. At least one\ranalyst who has tried to get some sign of how things are going was told\rthe company hasn't seen the August numbers yet, which means there still\rcould be reasons for concern.\r All of that said, Honeywell has been doing loads to improve itself, but\rour longtime Honeywell watcher, who is looking for the right time to\rhop back in, doesn't think there'll be signs of a solid rebound until\rnext summer. At the earliest.\r Short Positions\r   o From reader John Lee: \"How's this for an inflation indicator? Down\rhere in our cafeteria today we were confronted by a sign that indicated\rthe cafeteria was raising prices \"to cover rising food and labor\rcosts...\" But inflation is nearly nonexistent, right? Right (he said,\rsarcastically). Wouldn't be surprised to see a few fast-food chains\rthat missed earnings last quarter, because of rising costs, bite the\rbullet and raise prices, too. (A dime or a quarter isn't going to drive\rcustomers away; but a dime here at one place and a quarter there at\ranother would certainly lead to higher prices across the board. Or so\ryou'd think!)\r   o Stupid poll?!: That's what some folks thought of Friday's poll which\rasked whether you should pay more attention to a company, friendly\ranalysts or unfriendly analysts. (Unfriendly won by a landslide.)\rSeveral readers, however, wish I'd had a fourth alternative: All of the\rabove. Says reader Bridget Magnus: \"I think that if a person is going\rto make a realistic, informed decision about a company it is a good\ridea to listen to all three of those sources (the company, friendly\ranalysts, and unfriendly analysts). Putting them together will give a\rpotential investor a much clearer picture of what is (or isn't) going\ron.\" Great point! Which brings us to today's poll:\r Feel free to send emails to my sidekick Mark Martinez with any reason\rwhy you think the way you do. Cramer has pretty strong opinions about\rthis. And speaking of JJC, don't forget that he and I will be going\rhead-to-head at RealMoney.com's \"Cramer Live\" conference in San\rFrancisco later this month. Click here for more info.\r   o Bye, George: Marketing columnist George Lazarus of The Chicago\rTribune died Friday while commuting on the train to work. He was 68 and\rhe still wrote a daily column. He was a former colleague and I'd like\rto think, a friend, whom I didn't keep in touch with nearly enough.\rGeorge wrote the textbook on how to be a hard-working, daily,\rnews-oriented columnist. You could see just how hard he worked when he\rwalked through the office at the end of every day, looking exhausted,\ras he handed the finished copy into his editor. His salutation to me,\rwhen he saw me was always, \"Hey, scoop.\" Coming from the scoop, that\rwas an honor. Hey, George. -30-\r Herb Greenberg writes daily for TheStreet.com. In keeping with TSC's\reditorial policy, he doesn't own or short individual stocks, though he\rowns stock in TheStreet.com. He also doesn't invest in hedge funds or\rother private investment partnerships. He welcomes your feedback and\rinvites you to send any to Herb Greenberg. Greenberg also writes a\rmonthly column for Fortune.\r Mark Martinez assisted with the reporting of this column.\r___\rTheStreet.com Tips\r Now available\rJames J.

Is there someone at Enron who would be interested in speaking to ourMBAs about real options? Jim Dyer from our management science group isinterested in having someone for his decision analysis class this spring.Also, I am thinking about having a panel discussion in the Fall onvaluation issues.2. I recently received a phone call from the editor of the Journal ofApplied Corporate Finance, which is a practioner journal sponsored by theBank of America and Stern Stewart which is distributed to academics andmajor corporations.   They are doing a special issue on Energy and areinterested in an article on how energy derivatives are used for riskmanagement.   Are you aware of anyone from Enron who has written such anarticle?3. Last fall when you visited us at UT we discussed the possibility ofgiving lectures to Enron employees on valuation.   Ehud and I sent you aproposal but didn't get a response.   Is there still an interest in this.4. Murray Carlson and I are developing a general equilibrium model that wethink is potentially useful for valuing oil and gas derivatives as well asreal investments.   If you think this approach might be potentially usefulfor Enron, we would be interested in presenting our model to your researchgroup.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Best regards,SheridanSheridan TitmanDepartment of FinanceCollege of Business AdministrationUniversity of TexasAustin, Texas 78712-11179512-232-2787 (phone)512-471-5073 (fax)titman@mail.utexas.edu\n"

These two sectors are expected to account fornearly 80 percent of growth in gas consumption between 19998 and 2015. (GRIprojects the nation's gas demand will increase 50 percent, from 21.3 Tcf in19998 to 32.8 Tcf in 2015.)The added storage capacity will require a gas industry investment of nearly$5.0 billion (19998 dollars) between 19998 and 2015, or about $270 millionper year, the study estimates.The study, conducted for GRI by Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc.,Arlington, Va., identifies several trends that will drive future storagerequirements, including:* High consumption by power generation and industrial markets dampensseasonal volatility. Since these sectors have relatively flatyear-round load profiles, they act to compliment rather thanstimulate short term demand swings in traditional residential andcommercial applications which drive the need for increased storagecapacity to overcome seasonal differences.* Increases in the value of market-area storage to accommodate significantgrowth in gas usage for power generation are anticipated. Due toimprovements in technology, favorable economics, and low emissions,natural gas is expected to be the preferred incremental fuel forpower generation for the foreseeable future.* Pipeline restructuring is changing the role and value of storage. Mostnotable are the development of secondary markets for storage andpipeline capacity, growth of market hubs and gas marketers, and a shifttoward market-based rates.* Storage services are likely to become more efficient as a result oflocal distribution company restructuring. Storage operators areexpected to have a direct profit motive to maximize the value of storageand are likely to offer new services that use existing facilities moreeffectively.\"These trends are already beginning to have a major impact on gas storageoperations and will only be magnified in the future,\" said John Cochener,GRI project manager and principal analyst-resource evaluation. \"We arealready seeing increases in the value of well-placed storage facilities,particularly those able to capitalize on regulatory changes that allow forgreater operating flexibility. The reduction in regulatory constraints willallow storage market players even greater latitude in the future toexperiment with innovative competitive tools. This will result in greaterflexibility in the timely movements of gas to where it's required.Conversely, high-cost storage operators, who fail to respond to thechanging market by offering more flexibility, may eventually findthemselves at a competitive disadvantage in the future and may see thevalue of their storage asset stagnate.\"The study is GRI's most comprehensive look at gas storage markets. Includedis an analysis of changes in storage capacity, services, customer usagepatterns and costs, as well as proposed storage projects. LNG andPropane-Air are covered in addition to traditional types of storagefacilities. The study also reviews future storage requirements, costsassociated with expanding different types of storage capacity, and themerits of different storage locations.The study also looks at storage capacity under existing contracts. Onefinding is that the average length of time until contract expiration forfirm storage contracts has declined from 6.8 years in 19996 to 6.2 years in1999. More than half of the existing contracts in spring 1999 will expireby 20004. By 20006, 70 percent of existing contracts will have expired.Further, storage operators will generally be replacing storage contractsnegotiated by local distribution companies (with guaranteed rates ofreturn) with contracts negotiated by the growing ranks of gas marketers,who are under competitive pressure to hold down costs.The number of years remaining under existing storage contracts varies bycustomer type, according to the study. Currently, cogenerators andindependent power producers have the longest remaining contract lengths,followed by pipelines, gas utilities and marketers. Electric utilities andindustrial customers have the shortest average contract lengths remaining.Listed in the study are the top 50 storage capacity holders.Questions about the study or ordering should be addressed to Kelly Murray,GRI Baseline Center, Arlington, Va., at 703-526-7832; by fax at703-526-7805; or by E-mail: mailto:baseline@gri.org &lt;&lt;a href=&lt; The study(GRI-999/02000) can be ordered directly from the GRI Document FulfillmentCenter by fax at 630-406-59995.

They also have the problem\rof being the customer contact. If the network fails and customers can=01,t\raccess an application, they blame their ASP, not the network provider.\r For these reasons, many ASPs are expanding to offer more value, such as\rdelivering network services along with their applications. Enterprise\rManagement Associates advocates this approach - but looking to the\rfuture, as analysts are supposed to do, we see a much longer value\rchain. Providing other services along with applications is one step up,\rbut beyond that, we see a huge potential in the virtual space ASPs have\rcreated.\r We are already beginning to see pioneering companies exploring the\rpossibilities. For example, Minnesota company Agiliti is building an\ronline suite of applications with a consistent front end. This\rcoordinated suite of business applications is accessed through third-\rparty partners who provide customer care and support. The value that\rAgiliti offers is the integration and maintenance for a complete,\rbusiness-enabling software infrastructure. In a sense, this is an\ronline corporate back office.\r As ASPs evolve into full-service providers, more of them will offer\rservice and support combinations similar to Agiliti=01,s. But what about\rthe front end of the business, the product development side of things?\rWe=01,ve found one ASP that has evolved quickly to become a full-service,\rfront-end infrastructure provider, offering product development,\rfabrication and prototyping.\r Toolwire, a Silicon Valley start-up, provides a complete, integrated\rtool set for electrical engineers. This tool set incorporates state-of-\rthe-art design and fabrication software, as well as online information\rand training in the latest tools and support from various electronic\rsuppliers and fabricators. Toolwire=01,s vision is to provide a virtual\rspace where engineers worldwide can collaborate on the design of\radvanced electronic devices. Through an extensive partner network,\rToolwire provides not only tools but also collaborative space,\rprocessing power, training and supplier support. In a nutshell, the\rcompany sells a virtual corporation to any entrepreneur with a good\ridea. Ultimately, Toolwire expects to expand to incorporate the supply-\rand-distribution chain through its site as well.\r As e-commerce speeds up, a significant advantage is gained by reducing\rthe latency involved in delivering new products to market. In the area\rof electronics, latency is often due to the acquisition of new tools to\rfacilitate the design process. Toolwire=01,s approach dramatically reduces\rlatency for start-ups by eliminating the need to invest in highly\rvolatile and very expensive design tool sets. Likewise, Agiliti reduces\rlatency by off-loading the IT infrastructure support from an enterprise.\r Breaking new ground, of course, carries with it the problem of\rdefinition. What do you call this new virtual workplace, which combines\rall the necessary tools to design, produce, market and deliver a\rproduct without the need for any physical infrastructure? (Agiliti and\rToolwire haven=01,t reached this goal yet, but it is within their sights.)\rThe label we=01,ve come up with is =01&amp;virtual business service provider.=\r=018\rThis entity transcends the full-service ASP by not only providing\raccess to the services and applications a company needs but also\ractually providing the entire company itself.\r Companies like Agiliti and Toolwire are commodifying the enterprise.\rThe day is coming, very shortly, when an entrepreneur with a good idea\rwill be able to sit down at a terminal; design a product; ship the\rspecs to a fabricator; order components; plug into the appropriate\raccounting, billing and inventory systems; line up distribution\rchannels, sales and marketing resources; and obtain financing.

With more\renterprises using Linux, several companies have started to offer Linux\rcertification and training.\r One of the most popular programs is run by - not surprisingly - the top\rLinux company, Red Hat. The leading Linux distributor offers training\rand certification of its product for network professionals in a program\rsimilar to system-specific certifications such as Certified Novell\rEngineer and Microsoft Certified Software Engineer.\r Red Hat=01,s Certified Engineer (RHCE) program is a five-day course that\rconsists of four one-day labs followed by a certification test taken on\rthe fifth day. Prerequisites for the course include knowledge of basic\rIntel- and Intel clone-based hardware architecture, familiarity with\rbasic Unix file structure and shell programming, TCP/IP networking\rskills and network administration experience. The test can also be\rtaken on its own, without the four days of labs.\r Unlike the widely accessible Microsoft or Novell certification programs,\rRHCE courses and tests are only available at Red Hat training\rfacilities in Durham, N.C., Portland, Ore., San Francisco and Santa\rClara. The course costs $2,498; the test can be taken alone for $749.\r Red Hat certification can be valuable for companies investing heavily\rin Red Hat Linux as an alternative network operating system, or for IT\rprofessionals looking for a certification feather in their caps.\rHowever, the program has been criticized by some for its poor\raccessibility and high cost. The single-distribution focus of the\rtraining has also been at issue with some Linux users looking for\rcertification options.\r For Linux certification and training that isn=01,t tied to any specific\rdistribution, the Linux Professional Institute (LPI) has less expensive\rcertification test offerings.\r LPI offers basic, advanced and expert levels of Linux certification.\rThe beginning level certifies users beyond a basic help desk or\rpower-user level of knowledge. Prerequisites for this course are equal\rto the Red Hat program. The second level requires more in-depth study\rfor people looking for a system administrator=01,s level of certification.\rThe third level is for certification in more advanced and specialized\rareas, such as database server administration or kernel and device\rdriver development. Each level involves two tests, which cost $1000 each\rto take. Currently, only the requirements for the first level of the\rLPI program have been finalized; requirements for the second and third\rlevels could change in the near future. LPI=01,s tests are administered\rthrough Virtual University Enterprises=01, 1,7000 test centers worldwide.\rAmong LPI=01,s backers are Caldera, SuSE, Linuxcare, IBM and TurboLinux.\r Another option for distribution-neutral Linux certification is the Sair\rGNU and Linux Certification program. Similar to the LPI model, the\rprogram offers three levels of certification: Linux Certified\rAdministrator (LCA) for basic administrative-level certification; Linux\rCertified Engineer (LCE) for advanced system managers; and Master Linux\rCertified Engineer (MLCE) for senior systems managers. Four tests are\rrequired for each level of certification, with LCA, LCE and MLCE\rprograms currently available. Certification tests cost $999 each and can\rbe taken at 2,000 Sylvan Prometric testing centers worldwide.\r To contact Phil Hochmuth:\r---\rPhil Hochmuth is a writer and researcher for Network World, and\ra former systems integrator.

Last fall, Red Hat bought Cygnus Solutions,which develops embedded Linux tools and embedded operating systems,creating the biggest open-source company in the world. The mergerbrought together the Red Hat development team's expertise in theoperating system (they are the leading Linux distribution company) andthe unique gadget-related technology of Cygnus, such as its embeddedconfigurable operating system (eCos), embedded Linux tools andapplication programming interfaces.Last month, Red Hat began offering eCos as its own product, coincidingwith the release of Red Hat Linux 6.2. Red Hat is banking on Linux toemerge as the standard technology in enterprise handheld and serverconnectivity. The leaders in server and handheld operating systemdevelopment are currently Microsoft and Palm Computing, but Red Hatproclaims that having the same core operating system running on thefront and back ends of these post-PC, wireless handheld networkenvironments will lead to better performance and scalability. WithLinux running on the client and the server, business applications willcome to market more quickly as software can be written once for serverapplications, then only slightly modified for compatibility for thewireless handheld client, Red Hat says.Lineo, of Lindon, Utah, has also made strides in embedded Linuxtechnology development recently. Lineo currently offers its ownembedded Linux distribution, Embedex, in addition to the EmbedexBrowser - an embedded, graphical user interface-based microbrowserand a software development kit. The Embedex operating system, browserand development kit are aimed at the handheld and information appliancemarkets. Lineo is currently compatible with X86 and PowerPC processorsand runs on less than 4M bytes of RAM and 2M bytes of read-only memoryor flash memory. The company last week announced a new developmentpartnership with MIPS Technologies, so look for embedded Linux runningon the MIPS architecture in the near future.Also on the embedded bandwagon is Pennsylvania company Neoware Systems,which just announced its NeoLinux embedded Linux distribution based onRed Hat's Linux distribution. The company is offering NeoLinux forsmall handheld devices but is focusing more on \"informationappliances\" - that is, network devices dedicated to a single task suchas firewalls, routers and security devices. To complement its own Linuxdistribution, Neoware has also released its own hardware to runNeoLinux - the Eon Anything Box - which lets users configure thehardware to act as a variety of network devices.With all these various flavors of embedded Linux sprouting up, embeddedsystem and network device companies recently formed an industry boardto help the technology's development. Created in March, the EmbeddedLinux Consortium (ELC) - http:///www.embedded-linux.org - comprises overtwo dozen companies that specialize in embedded system hardware,software and Linux, including Red Hat, Motorola and IBM. The goal ofthe group is to spur \"the advancement of Linux-based solutions inembedded applications,\" the ELC says.As information appliances, thin servers and handheld devices becomemore prevalent in the enterprise, it appears that Linux will be a bigpart of the post-PC networking era. As a result, network managers willneed to become more familiar with what makes these embedded devicestick and with trends in the embedded Linux industry.To contact Phil Hochmuth:---Phil Hochmuth is a writer and researcher for Network World, anda former systems integrator.

The idea is to aggregate monthly, weekly and daily volatilities such that we can price individual options on half hours into the future.   We have a reliable methodology for the monthly vol curve at the EFA slot level.   The first issue to address was to use a \"reverse basvol\" to estimate the monthly vol curve at the half-hourly level of detail.   This required an estimation of half-hourly price return correlations.   This resulted in a scaling factor of approximately 1.30 that is applied to all EFA vols to convert to half-hourly (the scaling factors are slightly different by EFA slot, but not by nearly as much as might be expected). For the weekly and hourly half hourly vols, a historical analysis was carried out on the past few years data; a weighting-scheme was applied to add more emphasis to standard deviations calculated on more recent data.   COMBINING THE VOLATILITIESThe idea is to let the monthly vol curve get us to the start of the month and then assume that all half hours are positioned at 2 weeks and 3 days into the next month.   The volatility is aggregated using these time-weightings to ensure that we don't have a wildly different volatility for the options at the start of a month and at the end of a month.   Below is an example for half hour #38:I put the spreadsheet HalfHourlyVolModel.xls into the public directory, S:\\RESEARCH\\ANJAM\\HHHOPTIONVOLMODEL\\. I suggest we use the matrix of forward volatilities on the summary page and see what kind of numbers we get.   There may need to be some fine-tuning of the time-weightings, but in general, I believe we can start utilising these semi-final numbers.Regards,Anjamx35383\n"

I'm well aware of the long hours and individual contributions that are not always widely known.   However, comments and notes received, particularly during the last half of 1999, suggest that others not only notice your individual contributions but have also come to appreciate RAC's value to the overall organisation.

This communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action.   It is our intent to help you understand the situation.It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and Enron!   When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts.   At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.   Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake Hospitals, to name a few.   In a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network benefits applied.   Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90%.   Hospital admissions will still need to be pre-certified with UHC.These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.If You Need Medical Attention:   You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.   In some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.   If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.   Claim forms can be obtained by calling 1-8000-3332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.   Take this opportunity to consider your elections for 20001.   United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees through this transition.   We will communicate any   further developments that may impact you or your family.\n"

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 09/27/2000 111:04 AM --- \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Enron Human Resources @ ENRON   09/26/2000 08:18 PM Sent by: Enron Announcements@ENRONTo: All Enron Houstoncc:   Subject: Important Information About United HealthCare - Please Read!TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan BenefitsYou may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate their contract with UHC   in the Houston/Beaumont area.   This communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action.   It is our intent to help you understand the situation.It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and Enron!   When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts.   At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.   Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake Hospitals, to name a few.   In a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network benefits applied.   Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90%.   Hospital admissions will still need to be pre-certified with UHC.These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.If You Need Medical Attention:   You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.   In some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.   If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.   Claim forms can be obtained by calling 1-8000-3332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.   Take this opportunity to consider your elections for 20001.   United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees through this transition.   We will communicate any   further developments that may impact you or your family.\n"

With roaming capabilities andreal-time access to contact information, DigitalMe lets users respondquickly, no matter where they are or what station they're working from.InstantMe lets users communicate in real-time conversations withpartners, suppliers and clients. It also lets users have conversationswith any other AIM user worldwide (provided both users are logged in tothe service). It also will, I'm sure, lead to more involved discussionsof where to do lunch, rehashes of Sunday's football game and otherso-called \"water cooler\" chatting, all from the privacy of the user'sdesktop. That may or may not be a problem - you will want to formulatesome usage rules before implementing the technology.Novell plans to release a secure version of InstantMe in the next fewmonths, which will integrate encryption and digital certificates in amove to increase trust between two or more parties and ensure integrityand confidentiality of messages exchanged over the Internet.Instant messaging should provide a much-needed medium for quick,perishable communications, such as those requesting time-sensitivecoordination or short-fuse decisions. It's best used where e-mailwould be considered too slow to get the needed response. Generally,you'd use instant messaging in a situation where today you would usethe telephone. Instant messaging can be even faster than using thephone when you consider time spent on hold or navigating throughreceptionists and secretaries, and it's cheaper than a long-distancecall. Those are competitive advantages, and you should examine this newtechnology thoroughly before deciding if it is, or isn't, for you.InstantMe is a free download that supports Windows 95, Windows 98,Windows NT and Windows 2000.To contact Dave Kearns:---Dave Kearns is the Word Wrangler for Virtual Quill, a writing agencyserving the computer and networking industries.

Specifically, she was worried about the protection of\rintellectual property in such an arrangement.\r Intellectual property - or IP, as it is known to lawyers - refers to\rcopyrights, patents and trade secrets upon which your company depends\rfor its competitive advantage. In short, it=01,s anything you don=01,t want\ryour competitors to get their hands on. It can also include intangibles\rsuch as goodwill from current customers.\r How is IP put at risk in an application service provider (ASP)\rrelationship? In any ASP arrangement, a customer is forced to disclose\rintellectual property to one degree or another. The property may be\rsimple business plans or proprietary customer information. In any event,\rit is information that could do a great deal of harm if it were leaked\rto competitors or the universe at large. In the case of full-service\rASPs (those that provide integration and Web design services), IP can\ralso include the look and feel of the business in e-space.\r The problem is trust. An ASP must convince its customers that their\rinformation is secure. But how does an ASP even know what information\rneeds to be protected? Customers must retain full rights to their\rintellectual property and ensure that it is secure from disclosure.\r The most effective way for a customer to secure IP rights and\robligations is through a contract that clearly states who owns what.\rJust like a prenuptial agreement, both parties go into the arrangement\rwith rights and property. It is important to get these on paper prior\rto the business relationship. And this contract is different from a\rservice-level agreement SLA). While the SLA is a performance document,\rthe business relationship contract is one of rights and responsibilities.\r This also applies to the look and feel of the business. If an ASP\rdevelops a Web presence for a customer that provides a unique advantage\rto that customer, it is essential that the customer get its IP rights\rin writing. One peculiarity of the IP world is that unless you\rspecifically say something to the contrary, the creator of the IP is\rthe owner.\r The guidance Enterprise Management Associates always gives is: when in\rdoubt, write it down. If it offends the other party, at least you know\rwhere the sensibilities are. If it doesn=01,t, then that tells you\rsomething as well. In any case, having an obligation or right expressed\ron paper establishes a point of reference if things get fuzzy in the\rday-to-day ASP operation.\r As our telco manager friend noted, many things are uncertain in the new\re-business world we are creating. She is right. But we will be more\rconfident as we proceed if we remember that the obligations of good\rbusiness practice have not changed.\r To contact Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim:\r---\rSenior consultant Michael Jude and research director Nancy Meachim are\rwith Enterprise Management Associates in Boulder, Colo.,\r(http:///www.enterprisemanagement.com), a leading analyst and market\rresearch firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of enterprise\rmanagement.

There   are few things I would like to bring up to your attention.First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lotabout the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with thequality of the people at the Sydney office.1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can helpyou with a phone interview.2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I amvery interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him overto the States   where we lack desperately technical talent.Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? The main determination I need from you is whether he canfunction in a company like Enron. As any good academiche sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in caseyou don't have a PostScript reader on your system.3. Christian Werner does some really neat things onthe weather front. I would like to determine if he can helpus to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houstonfor a week to discuss the weather forecasting   technology with   Mike Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic? I think that he could learn a lotfrom Mike and other weather guys here how we translate weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad tounderwrite the cost of this trip.Vince\n"

Rochester was formed in 1982 to focus on the executive search forsenior individuals within Investment Banking and Commodity markets. Theoperation is based in London with a global network of associates. Businessis primarily generated in Europe with an ever increasing demand from bothAsia and the United States. More specifically with respect to Enron, Rochester has been involvedin the Energy markets since the opening of the International PetroleumExchange in London. In the early 19990's, with the advent of UK deregulation,Rochester was placing electricity traders. As always, with politicianschanging their minds, deregulation did not happen and market interest inEnergy and Power declined. Now that Europe is to deregulate a number of trading houses,investment banks and the utilities have expressed a strong interest inbuilding their market presence. Subsequently we are working on a number ofprojects that not only require traders but also complete staffing solutions. This includes: 1.) Board level directors 2.) Asset management 3.) Corporate finance 4.) Trading:   - Vanilla ( financial and physical ) instruments   - OTC derivatives ( Credit / Equity )   - Options   - Structured products 5.) Relationship management 6.) Management consulting 7.) Corporate lawyers Whilst power and energy are growth areas in themselves emissions andweather derivatives are rapidly becoming a great source of interest. Foryour guide a former employee of Rochester is now heading up the emissionsmarketing group at OM here in London. Rochester has a strong track record, and through repeat and referralbusiness, is rapidly establishing itself as a leader in this new andexciting global market. Should you have any questions or comments please do not hesitate tocontact us here in London. I look forward to speaking with you again andpromoting an understanding of mutuality between our two organisations.

Both of these events are goodopportunities to \"test drive\" the Emerging Technologies program and see ifthere is an interest in joining our partner group.SEPTEMBER 8 - WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?Our next insight-building event will be held at Wharton on Friday,September 8 and is entitled \"What Next On the Internet?\"This is primarily a Wharton faculty event and we will be exploring 3 areas:1) the New Economics on the Web, 2) Internet, Anywhere, and 3)Implications for (academic) Research and Education.   Speakers will includeJay Walker (Priceline.com), David Farber (Chief Technologist at the FCC)and Mohan Sawhney (Kellog Univ., one of the nation's thought leaders one-Commerce), along with several senior Wharton faculty members.There will be considerable discussion on how the next generation of theInternet will evolve and the implications for management and managementresearch.   We are inviting our industry partners to join us at this event,and participate in the discussion, which should contain some valuableinsights and also provides an opportunity to help set our research agenda.You are most welcome to participate, or designate a colleague, if you like.OCTOBER 19&amp;20 - WINNERS &amp; LOSERS IN THE E-COMMERCE SHAKEOUTThis will be a major Impact Conference to explore the coming Internetshakeout, and apply some of the traditional shakeout measures to E-Commerceand try to determine what we can expect.   It should be an intriguing day.If you plan to attend please RSVP early since we are sure to be\"overbooked\" for this event.   This is probably the best showcase for ourinsight-building activities, if you would like to invite any colleagueshelp determine if it makes sense for Enron to become a partner in the ETProgram.If you'd like to RSVP for you and any colleagues who would like to attendone or both of the events described above,   send me an email reply and I'llsend you a more detailed agenda and speaker description, etc.I'll be on vacation the rest of this week but if you have any questions orcomments you can call or email me next week.best regards,MichaelMichael S.

Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.   4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of unwinding our position. These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.Paulo Issler \n"

Politique internationale et que critique Marc Lazar,\rprofesseur . l'Institut d',tudes politiques de Paris, dans la derniSre\rlivraison de la revue Communisme (L'Age d'homme, no 59-60).\r Ce combat, qui se couvre de l'autorit, scientifique et s'autorise de\rl'empathie que provoque le bilan meurtrier des pays communistes, est de\rnature plut\"t id,ologique. Plus qu'en France, un v,ritable r effet-Livre no=\rir\r_ se fait sentir dans les pays naguSre soumis . la sphSre d'influence\rsovi,tique, o- de tels discours conduisent . de multiples d,rives ; entre\rautres au retour inqui,tant d'un mythe refoul,,, celui du r jud,o-bolchevism=\re\r_. Dans cette logique, les victimes de la Shoah se seraient, aprSs 1945,\rm,tamorphos,es en bourreaux staliniens.

Que la proportion de juifs\reurop,ens engag,s activement dans le communisme ait ,t, infime, voire\rmarginale, puisque, politiquement, la majorit, des juifs se sont r,partis a=\ru\rcours du XXe siScle entre sionisme, social-d,mocratie, orthodoxie ou\rassimilation, que le juda&lt;sme sovi,tique et est-europ,en ait lui-mme?consid=\r,rablement souffert de la terreur stalinienne, ne font rien . l'affaire?: i=\rnsidieusement . l'Est, la vieille th,matique du r jud,o-bolchevisme _?paraO=\rt faire son chemin, y compris jusque dans les cerveaux les plus savants.???D=\rans des pays fragilis,s par l'exp,rience du communisme r,el, par exemple en=\r?Roumanie, cette configuration doit tre replac,e dans le cadre d'une\rentreprise de refondation identitaire qui ,prouve le besoin de se nourrir\rd'une confrontation permanente avec la m,moire juive. Des r lobbies _\rsuppos,s y sont couramment accus,s de tenter - ,ventuellement sur la base\rd'une conspiration - de jeter un voile d'oubli ou d'ignorance sur des crime=\rs\rdont les juifs sont parfois d,sign,s comme les auteurs.

Si Georghe Bratianu fut bien victime de la=\r version roumaine?du stalinisme en 1953, on ne saurait minimiser non plus, =\rcomme le fait?l'auteur, l'universitaire britannique John Rogister, qu'il fu=\rt aussi l'un des?artisans du rapprochement de son pays avec l'Allemagne naz=\rie et un?nationaliste belliqueux. Tous les morts du communisme ont certes d=\rroit au?respect. Mais ce statut de victime ne rend pas forc,ment l'ensemble=\r de leur?action digne d'un ,loge inconditionnel.???Jean-Louis Margolin, qui =\ra sign, dans Le Livre noir les contributions sur le?communisme asiatique, r=\r,sume ironiquement ce qui provoque la r,ticence d'une?partie des auteurs : =\rr Dans les pays d'Europe orientale, ,crit-il, le?communisme, contraire aux =\rnobles et saines traditions nationales, serait?toujours surimpos, de l'ext,=\rrieur.

Gallup\rInternational, pour le compte de la fondation sud-africaine Helen Suzman po=\rur\rla promotion de la d,mocratie, confirme le ras-le-bol des Zimbabw,ens, dont\r65 % souhaitent le retrait de la vie publique du pr,sident, qui vient de\rfter ses soixante-seize ans.

Par deux fois,?le pr,sident a refus, de faire=\r appliquer les d,cisions de justice,?interdisant mme aux forces de police d=\r'intervenir. Dans sa fuite en avant,\rM. Mugabe a choisi encore une fois de prendre la minorit, blanche comme bou=\rc\r,missaire. Le proc,d, n'est pas nouveau.

Le combat est clair=\r,?c'est Noirs contre Blancs _, avait-il ajout,.???Le problSme foncier est cr=\rucial au Zimbabwe, o- Robert Mugabe promet aux r?v,t,rans _ une redistribut=\rion ,quitable des terres depuis l'accession?officielle du pays . l'ind,pend=\rance, le 18 avril 1980. Les accords de?Lancaster House, sign,s . Londres le=\r 21 d,cembre 1979, portaient sur les?conditions d'un cessez-le-feu et sur l=\res modalit,s d'accession au pouvoir de?la majorit, noire.

Mais c=\res accords pr,voyaient ,galement une?aide internationale . la r,forme agrai=\rre pouvant atteindre 2 milliards de?dollars. De l'aveu mme de Robin Cook, l=\re ministre britannique des affaires\r,trangSres, la Grande-Bretagne - ancienne puissance coloniale - n'y a\rcontribu, qu'. hauteur de 70 millions de dollars.\r M. Mugabe avait fait adopter, le 19 mars 19992, par le Parlement, une loi\rpermettant d'exproprier les riches fermiers blancs pour installer sur leurs\rvastes propri,t,s un grand nombre de petits paysans noirs. Poursuivant son\rdessein, il avait fait publier, le 28 novembre 19997, la liste officielle de=\rs\r1 5000 propri,t,s que le gouvernement souhaitait r nationaliser _ pour les\rredistribuer. L'expropriation portait sur quelque 5 millions d'hectares, la\rmoiti, des terres exploit,es par des fermiers blancs, et ne devait donner\rlieu . aucune indemnisation.\r Cependant, au cours des vingt derniSres ann,es, les quelques propri,t,s\rrachet,es ou r,quisitionn,es par les autorit,s ont ,t, redistribu,es non pa=\rs\r. de petits paysans noirs comme elles auraient d- l'tre, mais . des membres=\r?de la nomenklatura, dirigeants de la Zanu ou proches de la famille Mugabe.=\r???N_POTISME ET CORRUPTION???Le n,potisme et la corruption sont deux des prin=\rcipaux reproches adress,s par?l'opposition et la population au r,gime de M.=\r Mugabe, qui subit, depuis?d,cembre 19997, une pression populaire croissante=\r.

Mis . jour le vendred=\ri 28 avril 2000???Le d,mantSlement de Microsoft est envisag, pour mettre fi=\rn aux pratiques?anticoncurrentielles de l'entreprise de Redmond. Dans quel =\rsens d,couper la?soci,t, et en combien de morceaux ? Il y a plusieurs solut=\rions possibles mais?il est difficile d'en choisir une.???Une premiSre option=\r consiste . d,couper Microsoft selon un trait horizontal?qui s,parerait les=\r activit,s d,di,es aux logiciels d'application de celles du?systSme d'explo=\ritation. Ce d,membrement en deux morceaux r,sout la question?des produits l=\ri,s, comme le rattachement abusif d'Internet Explorer .?Windows, mais n'ent=\rame pas le monopole de Microsoft sur le march, des?systSmes d'exploitation =\rpour ordinateur personnel.???DeuxiSme solution : proc,der . un d,coupage ver=\rtical qui diviserait?l'entreprise de Bill Gates en mini-Microsofts identiqu=\res. Le nombre de ces?Baby Bills (nomm,es ainsi par la presse am,ricaine par=\r analogie avec les Baby?Bells cr,,,es lors du d,mantSlement d'ATT) doit tre =\rau moins de trois pour\rinstaurer la concurrence.\r Un troisiSme d,membrement envisageable est de combiner divisions horizontal=\re\ret verticale. Il donnerait naissance . quatre entreprises : trois Baby\rWindows, et une Baby Applications, qui conserveraient la libert, d',tendre\rleurs activit,s vers l'amont ou vers l'aval.\r Chacune de ces solutions entraOne des cons,quences diff,rentes pour le\rconsommateur et r,clame des mesures d'accompagnement plus ou moins co-teuse=\rs\rpour l'administration. Le d,membrement en deux morceaux aboutit . la perte\rdes ,conomies li,es . l'int,gration verticale (c'est l'id,e que la\rconnaissance complSte du systSme d'exploitation permet de d,velopper .\rmoindre co-t des logiciels d'application). Ces ,conomies sont toutefois ass=\rez\rfaibles selon les experts.\r Le co-t du d,mantSlement horizontal serait donc modeste pour les\rconsommateurs. Ce qui n'est pas le cas du d,membrement vertical. Les Baby\rBills vont mener des strat,gies de diff,renciation qui vont conduire . une\rfragmentation des standards. Les nouvelles versions de Windows ne seront pl=\rus\rcompatibles.\r La troisiSme solution cumule les deux inconv,nients. Sur le plan des\rb,n,fices, le classement s'inverse. En effet, le b,n,fice attendu des mesur=\res\rde d,mantSlement est celui qu'apporte la concurrence (baisse des prix et\racc,l,ration de l'innovation). Or la concurrence est d'autant plus forte qu=\re\rle nombre d'entreprises est grand et qu'aucun monopole ne subsiste sur les\rmarch,s.\r Le d,mantSlement vertical et horizontal en quatre morceaux laisse esp,rer u=\rn\rplus grand b,n,fice que le d,mantSlement vertical en trois morceaux, qui\rlui-mme est plus avantageux pour le consommateur que le d,mantSlement?horiz=\rontal en deux morceaux. Du c\"t, des co-ts administratifs, le?d,membrement h=\rorizontal et vertical est ,galement la solution la plus?avantageuse. La seu=\rle t?che des pouvoirs publics est d'empcher les alliances\ret les fusions. Les d,penses de contr\"le sont trSs ,lev,es en revanche dans\rle cas du d,mantSlement horizontal. Des mesures de r,glementation, comme la\rtarification administr,e, doivent n,cessairement compl,ter le dispositif\rpuisque le monopole de Windows est maintenu intact. Le cas du d,mantSlement\rvertical occupe une position interm,diaire. Il appelle simplement des mesur=\res\rr,glementaires transitoires, comme l'interdiction faite au personnel r,part=\ri\rau d,part dans les trois soci,t,s de changer imm,diatement de Baby Bill (de\rrejoindre par exemple celle qui resterait dirig,e par Bill Gates).\r L'objectif poursuivi par les autorit,s de la concurrence est de servir\rl'int,rt du consommateur. La solution qui devrait tre choisie par la\rdivision antitrust am,ricaine est donc celle qui maximise l',cart entre le\rb,n,fice apport, par une plus grande concurrence et le co-t induit par la\rperte en ,conomies d'int,gration verticale et de compatibilit,. La\rcomparaison entre le d,mantSlement horizontal et le d,mantSlement combin, e=\rst\rici difficile. Dans le premier cas, il faut soustraire un faible co-t d'un\rfaible b,n,fice tandis que dans le second, il faut retirer un co-t ,lev, d'=\run\rb,n,fice ,lev,.\r On peut en revanche ,liminer facilement la solution du d,mantSlement\rvertical. En effet, en compl,tant le d,coupage vertical par un d,coupage\rhorizontal, l'intensit, de la concurrence augmente fortement et donc le\rb,n,fice pour le consommateur tandis que ce dernier subit un faible surco-t=\r.\rRestent donc deux solutions possibles que seules des ,valuations chiffr,es\rpermettraient de d,partager. Les autorit,s de la concurrence am,ricaines\rs'apprtent . demander un d,mantSlement horizontal, ce qui reflSte sans dout=\re?que la solution combin,e est moins favorable au consommateur.???Si l'objec=\rtif poursuivi est l'int,rt g,n,ral - un objectif que l'on peut\rprter aux juges - le choix de d,mantSlement doit aussi tenir compte des?co-=\rts des mesures de contr\"le pour l'administration. La solution . retenir?n'e=\rst alors plus forc,ment la mme puisqu'il s'agit maintenant de maximiser\rle gain pour le consommateur net du co-t administratif. Si les ,conomies po=\rur\rl'administration que permet de r,aliser le d,mantSlement horizontal et\rvertical l'emportent sur la r,duction du gain pour le consommateur (due en\rparticulier . la fragmentation des standards), la cr,ation de trois Baby\rWindows et d'un Baby Applications est une meilleure solution. Rien ne dit\rdonc que le juge Thomas Penfield Jackson retiendra l'option de d,mantSlemen=\rt\ren deux morceaux propos,e aujourd'hui par les plaignants.\r Fran?ois L,vque   est professeur d',conomie . l'Ecole nationale sup,rieure?d=\res mines de Paris. par Fran?ois L,vque\r   Le Monde dat, du samedi 29 avril 2000\r   \n"

According to IDC, a research firm based in\rFramingham, Mass., Linux was the fastest-growing server operating\rsystem last year, with a 93% growth rate over the year before. Linux\rwas the second most-shipped operating system in 1999 after Windows NT,\rcapturing 24% of new licenses shipped.\r As for the embedded market, Linux has emerged as an ideal platform for\rnetwork appliances, because the system can be modified to handle\rspecialized, dedicated tasks very well. Companies such as Cobalt\rNetworks, Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linux-based\rappliances, ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls.\r But what of the open source hacker=01,s dream of =01&amp;Linux on every desktop=\r?=018\r Sure, Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever, with\rcolorful, shrink-wrapped boxes of Caldera, Red Hat and Corel Linux now\ravailable at places like CompUSA. However, analysts have said that\rLinux=01,s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro\rareas of network servers and embedded operating systems.\r According to IDC, Linux currently runs on only 4% of U.S. desktops. The\rhold Microsoft Windows has on the desktop market will remain strong,\ranalysts say, despite such factors as Microsoft=01,s antitrust problems\rand the surging popularity of Linux.\r Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their product=01,s desktop\rfuture. Recently, SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linux=01,s future on\rdesktops. Dyroff said, =01&amp;given the lack of applications available, we\rreally can't claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet.=018\r A recent survey by Survey.com gives more hope for Linux desktops.\rAccording to the survey of 1,640 enterprise network managers, open\rsource operating systems are used on 10% of desktops, with the number\rjumping to a surprising 23% of enterprise desktops by 20002.\r Despite the mix of numbers being thrown around, two important factors\rthat will determine the success of Linux as an enterprise client\rdesktop are: a standardized, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)\rand available applications.\r One company that is working to make Linux more user friendly is Palo\rAlto-based Eazel, which is designing a next-generation file management\rsystem and user interface to run on top of the Linux kernel. According\rto Eazel=01,s Web site, the company=01,s goal is to bring Linux to the mass=\res\rand =01&amp;do it in a way that appeals to today's Linux users and to mere\rmortals.=018\r The company was founded by a group of former Apple executives, and is\rallied with the Gnome project, which has been doing extensive Linux\rdesktop environment development for several years. Eazel is due to have\ra product out by the middle of this year. With an intuitive, icon-based\rfile management environment, Eazel is hoping its user interface will be\ran improvement over the two current Linux GUIs, Gnome and KDE, and will\rhelp standardized the look and feel of Linux for =01&amp;regular=018 users. For\renterprise mangers who have already embraced Linux on the server side,\rthis development will be worth keeping an eye on.\r On the applications side, several office productivity suites have been\ravailable for some time, such as Sun=01,s StarOffice suite and KOffice for\rthe KDE desktop. Corel has also ported its office products, such as\rWordPerfect, over to Linux to complement its own distribution of the\roperating system. While there have been recent rumors (started by Linux\rCare Vice President Arthur Tyde) that Microsoft is working on a port of\rMS Office to Linux, Microsoft officials deny this.\r While Linux may never supplant Windows as the industry-standard desktop,\rthere should be plenty of opportunity for Linux PCs in enterprise nets\rin the future.\r To contact Phil Hochmuth:\r---\rPhil Hochmuth is a writer and researcher for Network World, and a former\rsystems integrator.

Steve emerged not only as the mosttechnically qualified member of the group   but also as a natural leader, highlyrespected by his peers and internal customers.   Steve has a very high energy leveland is very efficient as a manager and as   coach of new talent.His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value technicalskills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the same caliberas Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to Houstonfor 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a sufficientincentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has greatly improved.Please, let me know what you think.Vince\n"

We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to validate some   inputsbefore releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both London and Houston workwith the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.A few comments.1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston (Cantekin)   and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated positions and prices on a regular basis.3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas: a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its portfolios. This is the liquidity risk   resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the underlying positions. b.   We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating the position numbers (i.e. look   into the details of specific transactions).   From what I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk   management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option prices (and deltas). They get some   option prices by calling brokers.4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the inputs are right). But, as I have said,   VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.Vince \n"

The biggest change in VaR from adding this information has been to the Cocoa bean position which has increased from approx $45,9000 to $506,5553.The overal VaR has not changed by very much as the position file I was sent from Andreas had not changed from the 26th - I have queried this and it will not be a problem to re-run the numbers on Monday if I recieve a further file.The VaR summary for all the metals is as follows :Also, after having a conversation with Bjorn about stress/scenario analysis I thought I might quickly try to set up a few scenarios to see how sensitive the VaR is to a position change in Aluminium, Nickel and Copper.I have only applied position increases (thge direction of the shifts are dependent on the monthly outright position direction) up until Dec2000.The shifts and results are given in the following attached spreadsheet.   It is interesting that the individual VaR's are particuarly sensitive to increasing the position for Nickel.I would like to discuss these results on Monday and any further suggestions for senarios would also be gratefully recieved.Have a good weekend,Kirstee.\n"

His brother rode the MS 150 as well, so he wanted to be\rthere for the finish. He suffered a broken rib and is reportedly doing\rfine. All other riders were treated and released by Monday morning.

As you know, it was very hot\ron Sunday and people simply weren't staying hydrated.\r There are so many people who make this ride happen =01) most of which are\rvolunteers.

NBCRaymond Cote is Vice President, Financial Engineering at FinRad Inc.,   a Montreal-based consulting firm offering financial management solutions that   combine advisory and systems development services to &amp;corporations and   financial institutions.Abstract:Liquidity risk, as opposed to   credit and market risks, has received little attention in professional or   academic journals. We argue that analyzing bank liquidity risk can be viewed as   a variation of credit risk analysis. After introducing some concepts and   definitions, the presentation defines a framework allowing to measure a bank's   structural liquidity risk. It then shows that combining the framework with   modern credit risk measurement tools leads to a liquidity risk VAR measure. The   presentation then offers concluding comments on the integration of the liquidity   risk measurement framework within enterprise-wide risk management.Swaps, Spreads and   Bonds September 29, 2000Chris   LeonardSenior TraderFixed Income   Arbitrage?October 27, 2000Chuck   McHughVice President, NBC-New YorkFund Management and   Market efficiency November 10, 2000Andrea   LeePortfolio Manager, Freiss AssociatesPierre-Philippe   Ste-Marie---http:///pstemarie.homestead.com\n"

      "body": "\nJeff,I would like to get on your calendar (together with Jeff Shankman) for 15 - 30 minutesto discuss the results of my visit at the Wharton School with Tom Piazze.A separate message about   this visit will follow.I would like also to talk to you   about the way we manage our relationships withdifferent universities. Historically, we were rather passive customers ofthe academic institutions, trying to hire the best students and limiting our presenceon the campuses mostly to the recruiting trips and campus receptions.We should rethink the way we work   with universities. The efforts to get the best students look more and more like a hand-to-hand combat and often we are notvery successful. It is critical that we increase our presence on the campusesand this can be accomplished in a number of different ways:1. Involvement in research projects. For   example, we are currently   underwriting two researchprojects at Stanford University, involving   Ph.D. students of Professor   Nicholas Bambos(a top expert on communications networks). We shall participate in formulationof the projects' objectives and will be given access to the results.Involvement in research projects allows us to obtain access to current scientific developments in the leading universities and also to lock-up some verypromising students. Most companies in the high tech industries have such programs.2. Lectures and presentations by Enron employees. Practically every presentationI have made so far at different universities resulted in a number of resumes and hiring decisions.It is important that students get exposed to Enron early in their academic program. In many cases,the best students have already made up their mind by the time we approach them during their senior years.3. Visits by faculty members in Enron. Closer cooperation with the universities has many advantages in addition to getting the best studentsand obtaining access to current research. The universities are very important in shaping public   opinionon the issues critical to Enron's future (especially in the area of deregulation and design of new markets).Currently, the relationships with many leading academic centers depend on personal commitment of a numberof overworked Enron employees. In many cases, there is no continuity and focus.I want to recommend a creation of a special function (VP or MD level) responsible for coordinatingour relationships with the universities. This function would be separate from our Analyst/Associateprogram. I have many ideas how this function could be structured.Vince\n"

Zimin Lu referred us to you regarding questions we have on the Real Option Valuation Approach.   We are very enthusiastic about what we have read and heard about this valuation method.We have been doing some preliminary research on the Real Option Valuation approach and believe that integrating this approach into our financial model would bring a significant increase to the value to the project.   We have identified some deal aspects we believe would be ideal to valuate as real options.   Our goal is to work with the development team to structure the deal to incorporate the Real Option Valuation approach into the model enabling us to arrange the contracts within the deal to optimize the project's value.We would like to arrange a meeting with you at your ealiest convenience to brainstorm on additional deal aspects that can be valued using the real option approach as well as on ways to quantify these aspects using the Real Option valuation Method. Please advise if you will be able to meet with us within the next week or two. Thank you for your kind attention,Jeanne AnneX 6-6547\n"

American Gas TeamE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: North American Gas ,URL: http:///www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=51666&amp;amp;m=1272 ,Pressure in the North American gas markets remains intense, despite moderate summer weather that so far has allowed storage injections to average over 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. High injection rates have provided occasional relief for prices, but summer is far from over. The absolute level of storage inventories remains critical, and the prices should stay above the $4.000 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) level through August. The competition between power generation and storage for supply will continue, and gas prices must remain high enough to discourage marginal end-use demand and allow low storage inventories to build. CERA expects an average price of $4.20 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub for August (see Table 1), which will result in continued burning of residual fuel oil by the Atlantic Coast dual-fuel market and continued ammonia plant shutdowns, which began during the May and June price increases.Although continued strong storage injections would take some pressure off the gas market, a shift to a lower pricing plane---below $4.000 per MMBtu---depends on sustained mild summer weather. CERA expects gas demand for power generation to climb through the end of July and into August, and higher temperatures and power loads will limit supply that is available for injections. The pressure in the market is likely to tighten over the weeks to come, and the market will remain vulnerable to price spikes above $4.50 per MMBtu through August and September.Gas Storage---Not Yet EnoughDespite recent high storage injection rates, storage inventories are not high enough to ensure that supplies will reach adequate levels for next winter. An end of mild weather in the Midwest and Northeast and seasonally intense heat in the Southwest would cause injection rates to decline significantly over the remainder of July and into August. The result would be injections averaging approximately 9.0 Bcf per day for July, largely owing to higher rates early in the month, and 7.0 Bcf per day for August (see Table 2).These rates would keep the year-over-year inventory deficit above 350 Bcf for July and August, with inventories on a path to reach between 2.7 and 2.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of October, still an all-time low level for the beginning of winter. Reaching even this level would require at least two of the following to occur: a continuation of quite mild weather, little or no hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, or warm weather through October. As a result, the pressure is likely to remain high in the gas market at least through August.Regional Markets---The Topock PremiumBuoyed by strong regional power demand and high utilization rates on pipelines into California, Topock continues to be the highest pricing point in North America. High power loads in the West are supporting other prices in the region, but supply growth and pipeline capacity constraints out of the Rockies and high pipeline utilization rates between the San Juan Basin and California have maintained extremely wide differentials between those markets and California. California should remain strong, and CERA expects some modest strengthening in Rockies and San Juan basis differentials during July and August with increasing Pacific Northwest gas demand for power generation (see Table 3).CERA's outlook by region follows:* Rockies. Continued strong supply growth in the Rockies is challenging pipeline capacity out of the region, and differentials have come increasingly under pressure this summer. CERA expects some modest recovery in Rockies differentials as hydroelectric generation on the Pacific Northwest declines. Differentials should average $0.555 per MMBtu for August.* San Juan. CERA expects continued strong power loads in the West to keep San Juan prices near current differential levels. August differentials should average $0.35 per MMBtu for August.* Permian and Mid-Continent. Hotter weather and higher power loads in Texas have already strengthened differentials at the Permian Basin, and that tightening should hold through August. The Mid-Continent should continue to price at a discount to Permian supplies.* Chicago. Chicago prices have held just above $0.05 above the Henry Hub for much of July, a condition CERA does not expect to change significantly during August. Chicago should average $0.06 above the Henry Hub.* Northeast markets. Mild weather in the Northeast quickly cooled price premiums from the mid-$0.40s to the mid-$0.20s from early to mid-July. With hot weather still likely to return, however, New York prices for August should average $0.32 above the Henry Hub.Canadian Markets---Western Supply No Longer in Decline?Although TransCanada flows are down, the strong market overall and wide differentials have resulted in increased flows on PGT (up 3000 million cubic feet [MMcf] per day year-over-year). Domestic demand is still down slightly from last year's levels. Storage injections have picked up (in both the East and West) and, although behind last year's, are still above the five-year average. Western Canadian supply increased slightly on a year-over-year basis in June; July thus far is basically running flat with last year.The impact of the 1999 TransCanada capacity turnback and the current rate structure is beginning to be felt in the Canadian market. It is more and more apparent that TransCanada is becoming the swing pipeline, with flows 4000 MMcf per day below last year's levels. The effect of the difference between contracted capacity (available to shippers at incremental cost) and uncontracted capacity (available only on a full-cost basis) is becoming evident. With supply filling contracted capacity on export pipes, the inability of TransCanada to discount below the minimum interruptible rate may be creating a two-tiered market. This shift results in a different netback for holders of capacity (similar to the higher netback achieved by the aggregators in the past) and those without capacity (those required to acquire full cost transportation, or to sell at AECO). This lack of flexibility is contributing to the wider differential between Henry Hub and AECO (currently averaging in the high U!S$0.70s). AECO is expected to average C$4.91 per gigajoule (US$3.52 per MMBtu) for August.***end***Follow URL for PDF version of this Monthly Briefing with associated Tables.Note: Should the above URL not work, please use the following: http:///www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/0714000_15/nag_alt_0714000_15_ab.html***Account ChangesTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mailaddress, etc. go to: http:///eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfmThis electronic message and attachments, if any, contain informationfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

It seems to me that the framework Ihave been working on does allow addressing some fundamental issues andallows describing the salient features of power markets.   I feel a briefinfo may inform you what have I been up to.Conceptually speaking, my approach relies on the understudying that theabsence of cash and carry implies non-hedgibility of the most fundamentalbuilding blocks of power market - forward contracts of hourly duration.This clearly demands a risk premium embedded in power prices.   I have beenable to develop a machinery to capture this risk premium, and calculate itsimpact on pricing of other products.   In particular, the method allowsconsistent generation of hourly forward curve (per each geographic region),hence generation of forward curves of longer duration.   It provides us notonly with forward curves, but also their physical (not risk-neutral)distribution.   It also allows one to analyze the sensitivity of the forwardcurve with respect to the volumetric risk.   As a fundamental   input ,   Iconsider the ratio of properly compounded generation output (load) and thecorresponding maximum available generation supply.   The first one is wellobservable and forecastable due to its stationarity.   The second one   isdefined by the first one and the generation and transmission profile of theregion.   Much of the required information is in the public domain.The market price of risk incorporated in the model depends on this ratio andthe calendar time.   This time dependence of the market price of risk allowscapturing of the dynamics of the returns per unit risk over time, and itsdependence on the ratio mentioned above reflects the intuition and thereality that closer the demand to the maximum available supply highercompensation do the investors expect.I have also realized that the transmission related factors may beincorporated into this framework in a very consistent and robust manner.This approach also allows quantification of the margins as a stochasticprocess dependent on the volumetric factors, among other things.   It allowsposing and solving the problem of maximization of the margins while keepingtheir variance under control in a very elegant and robust way.I have developed the first version of mathematical tools and prototypesoftware reflecting all these issues.   My inability to complete this programhas been resulted from the severe instability, lack of access and the cashflow problems I have experienced in the last few years.   I have alsounderstood that programs of this magnitude cannot be finished from the\"grandpa's garage.\"Nevertheless, I think I have developed a very systematic and robustunderstanding and methodology, and at least, I have convinced myself thatthis approach leads to a comprehensive system.With all this said, I don't want to make an impression of a stiff person,who has his agenda and under any circumstances is willing to push itforward.   I have always been very flexible, and in my consulting experience,I have always accommodated the needs and wishes on my clients.   In my shortperiod of employment with Altra I have been very ethical, I have played bythe rules, I have done whatever I have been asked to do, and have been ateam player.   The reasons they have asked me to resign have nothing to dowith me personally.   They have been respectful to me, they have valued me ascapable person, but have found that given the direction of the company(which has become self-evident with the consequent developments), \"furtherAltra goes, further I will be frustrated with where they go.\"   It was almostformulated that it is better for me to separate from Altra as soon as I can.As an evidence of appreciation, they have continued paying me as of today,something that they have not done for some others, but it is coming to itsend, too.   I am bringing this up just to reiterate that my separation fromAltra has had nothing to do with me or my entrepreneurial working style vs.corporate style, etc.   I have no doubts that I can function equally well ineither environment.I wish that your presentation goes well with your new superior, and that myjoining Enron becomes a possibility.Regards,Martin - martin.doc\n"

As we have discussed, your presentation would provide the Governor and his guests with a national/ global perspective on pricing trends for natural gas , electricity and oil and their impact on agricultural production costs. We may also include a hedging presentation, but have not committed to do so yet.   Your presentation would be scheduled at the start of the meeting, w/ an anticipated length of twenty minutes.   A University of NE   ag economist will provide a state perspective for the group. Following the conclusion of both presentations time would be allotted for questions. We expect approximately 20 people to attend the roundtable. \n"

Also, you will can see that I have subtracted any positions that are from R Wolf in the Mercur download - this was point (1) of his note.As a quick question?Do you think it is worth including Zinc concentrate (184000 dmt) and lead concentrate (920 dmt) ?I think we may need to check the TC price for these and the conversion for the one given in the model for copper as I think that the original historical price file (TChistory) is quoted in c/lb - I guess this is cents/pound? rather than $/dmt which is the units that position is quoted in . Speak to you soonKirstee \n"

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 06/16/2000 05:50 PM --- \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Eric Groves   06/16/2000 05:38 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Scott Earnest/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Moon/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ModelsI will be in the office on Tuesday morning.   Hopefully we can meet amongst ourselves and then Shankman to discuss progress and next steps.Thanks,EricEric's \"book\" modelEnron - LNG Project NPV modelPlease see notes below.   Let me know if you have any questions,Marg.   mb) 713-408-7961***A few notes:Summary:   See columns F,G, and HENE Cash Inflow:   (Henry Hub + Basis at Elba {Lake Ch was left out of the analysis, see below}) x Unloaded volumes coming from Qatar, Algeria, &amp; VenezuelaENE Cash Outflow:   Fixed &amp; Escalating COS at Elba + Fixed &amp; O&amp;M Charter Hires for the Newbuild &amp; Hoegh Galleon + Variable terminaling costs at Elba + Voyage costs on the ships + FOB paid to Qatar, Algeria &amp; VenezuelaHenry Hub Gas Price:   Set to $3.555 through 20003, but then dropped to $2.90/MMMBtu.   You can customize this column as you choose.Loaded vs. Unloaded:   Revenues are on loaded volumes, Costs are on unloaded volumes.   I had the unloaded / loaded percentage for both Newbuild and Hoegh for both Algeria &amp; Qatar.   I didn't have them for Venezuela so I just extrapolated based on the number of days it took to go round trip. Galleon To come up with unloaded volumes, I just multiplied the percentage (unloaded / loaded) by the loaded volume.   Lake Charles:   I started to include this in the analysis, but in the end, left it out... I don't think we need it unless we want to model spot cargoes pre-Elba (pre-4/1/02) in the future.   Adding it doubled the complexity of everything.   So, for all practical purposes, it doesn't impact the analysis at all --- you'll see that all the Lake Ch costs are zero.Ship Usage:   I know you told me to run 50% coming from Algeria, 50% coming from Qatar.   However, you can get more volumes to Elba if you take 7.6 cargoes/yr from Qatar (running the Hoegh Galleon to its max) and 13.9 cargoes/yr from Algeria (not the full capacity of the Newbuild, but the max of the Elba terminal capacity).   Thus, this is how it's been modeled.   However, you won't see the volumes on the Newbuild until 1/1/03 (when the charter starts? --- this is changeable in cell M26 {when you start shipping volumes from Algeria to Elba via NB} and both AC25 and AD25 {when you start incurring charter costs for the NB}).   Regarding shipping from Venezuela, you could either run the volumes from Venezuela using the Newbuild or the Hoegh Galleon.   I chose the Newbuild b/c its voyage costs were cheaper.   The fixed costs are there regardless of which ship you choose.Shipping Voyage Costs:   The voyage costs in $/MMMBtu are calculated from the voyages from Algeria (for the Newbuild) and Qatar (for the Hoegh Galleon) to Elba.   The Newbuild voyage costs should drop on 1/1/04 when the volumes start coming from Venezuela (rather than Algeria), but they aren't currently modeled that way.FOB to Qatar/Algeria/VZ:   This got a little complicated so I just plugged in some fixed numbers.   $1.000/MMMBtu to both Qatar and Algeria, $2.30/MMMBtu to Venezuela.NPV Calcs:   I've done some, but delete them if you wish.***\n"

I hopeyou recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow &amp; me when you keynoted at my1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted tointroduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing aninnovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers KuppuswamySeshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal foundersof SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific AdvisoryBoard. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during yourkeynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG andhas been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch withJP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. EdColloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have hugevalue-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, Idon't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision byBob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.SKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization inelectronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (AlternativeTrading Systems). It achieves this through a process of \"strategicnegotiation\" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement toany extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Ourinitial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/powerinstruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and otherweb-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to EnronOnline.SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:1)   It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidthavailable, continguity of the allocation, and such.)2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to \"static\" matching.3) It is multi-lateral.4)   It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do intraditional markets.Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading atFidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or anyother Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.SKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or yourrepresentative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, ina meeting.

Second, I need a completedapplication form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriateboxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in aform.Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Fridayso plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if youcan.   Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants andinteresting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across theplaza from the hotel).We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner onFriday and Saturday evenings.   The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of theAlamo at 8:000 p.m.   For Saturday we are still working out plans for theevening so stay tuned.There will be more information later as the conference nears.   Lookingforward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.John - announcerev.docJohn D. MartinCarr P.

An example might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay $12.000 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs (\"shrinkage\") and 6.5% for overhead expenses.   A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 (\"basis\"), and might call Brooklyn and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .   The trader's spread is $0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.2225 for firm capacity tomorrow.   As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum (\"it's not worth their time to haggle\") (There is a further issue of \"secondary markets\" not important to the model yet).   For South Texas and Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take (pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).   And, once the trade is in the system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.Clayton\n"

This version comes with the subject line of \"resume\" and\rcontains an attachment called \"resume.txt.vbs\".\r The file contains a fake resume, though reports vary on whether it is a\rGerman or a Swiss engineer that is profiled. Makes no difference - the\rfile infects the host computer and then attempts to send itself to\reveryone in the local Outlook address book.\r It seems as if the virus is targeted at customers of the United Bank of\rSwitzerland. The new strain attempts to steal UBS account information\roff the infected computer. UBS claims that the virus threatens few\rpeople and that most customer data is secure.\r For U.S. users, the problem could be more clogged e-mail pipes. But\rhopefully, the general user population is now trained to be wary of any\rattachment, especially those ending in .vbs. Most of the antivirus\rvendors are updating their virus definition files, and protection\rshould be available shortly, if not already.

This is a response to the heavily decision-tree dominated approach taken by most people at the last conference I spoke at.   I want to demonstrate explicitly that my approach covers both decision tree and option pricing as special cases, the synthesis needed for correct real option valuation.My presentation now covers:1. Decision trees.2. Binomial option pricing trees.3. Power station valuation.4. Power asset development.The option pricing and power examples are based on the (too simplistic) binomial tree method.   I obviously won't indicate my thoughts on the most correct way to do this.Steve\n"

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 02/23/2000 08:40 AM ---Pinnamaneni Krishnarao02/222/2000 01:10 PMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: News article on Enron   India: Enron aftermath   Business Line - 02/21/2000   Abhay Mehta   Copyright (C) 2000 Kasturi &amp; Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence Wire   Power Play   A Study of the Enron Project   * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195   THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the   inception of the project proposal in 19992; and the sordid tale ends only in 19997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even   admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 19996, which while commenting that \"This case has   highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence, political considerations outweigh the public interest and   the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before   the courts of law\" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even   though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.   The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required   evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.   Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological narration - of all events, including the process of bending all   rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of   India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.   It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the   concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'   documents.   All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet   committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to   their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory 'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the   layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the   events of 19991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen   annexes of the small book (of 2226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of factual information. The strange saga of the Enron   project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted   here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem.   The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the   Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited liability company registered in India, through a maze of   intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front' companies registered in various tax-free havens.   Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount to $ 35 billion (at 19998 exchange rates, around Rs.   1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a) crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than   doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored' figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the   charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 19998 level of prices, was to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents   (per unit) for 'energy costs'.   The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone   up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.   Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 1000 per cent - even though international prices have more than doubled - we   may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a total payment of 111.25 US cents per unit of electricity   supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase I of the project.   Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X 24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at   111.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually; for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.   This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US   dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay   Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority, for   supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.   The really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase   in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of   the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory; the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government   indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees   extended by both governments.   The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the   Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power   already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 2000   and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit) and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal   power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.   The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.   This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.   It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of   blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,   namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project. The   detailed facts, the letters exchanged in the above context, the pressure tactics adopted, the flouting of all procedures norms, even   statutory provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, are all carefully documented by Abhay Mehta.   Mehta correctly concludes: \"We frequently blame external agencies - like the World Bank - for all our problems, when, as a   matter of fact, we ourselves are our own worst enemies. In the instant case, the World Bank not only advised the Government of   India against the project, it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of the total inadvisability of this project. In fact, one must note   here that in 19996, neighbouring Pakistan, which had entered into a somewhat similar MoU with Enron, cancelled the project (and   the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron), for a $ 670 million, 782 MW residual oil-fuelled power plant, even though that   Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6.4 US cents per KWH over a 30 year period. (Note the   estimated rate of 111.25 cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in December 1999, which works out to around Rs. 5   per unit).   One could go on; but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehta's crisp, factual, matter of fact narration of the Enron   saga, and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the story, about 'The Next Round of Scams'.   For quite some time, the ruling elite in India has been intent on 'privatising' all public enterprises; and even 'utilities' are no   exception. The 'unbundling' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation of all the 'profitable' segments. All this - as per the current   'disinformation campaign' - is supposedly in the interest of rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply.   The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the Government - by the Torrent Group - of the Ahmedabad and   Surat Electricity companies at less than one-tenth of the market value of the assets of thee facilities. Again, much like the Enron   saga, all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government were overruled.   And, Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break-up of power utilities into three segments, generation, transmission   and distribution, - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the new thrust by the ruling elite, for reasons that do not require to   be spelt out.   Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad and Surat Electricity companies, and of the break   up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him, yet his statement can be stated today to be prophetic; the UPSEB is now on   the firing line. The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision   to trifurcate the UPSEB; and the Union Minister of Power, Mr. Rangarajan Kumaramangalam's statement that the UPSEB is a   loss making, inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities after the trifurcation - need to be noted.   That 40 per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government; that tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP   government and not by the UPSEB; that the UPSEB does not have the cash even for routine maintenance as a result of the above   - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider. That the remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and   restructuring, is not even to be debated. The whole idea is to privatise the profitable segments, and to leave the public sector entity   with all the problem areas, including rural energy supply. It is against this background that Abhay Mehta's book needs to be widely   disseminated, read, and its implications understood.   What is at stake is not a 'utility' here or a PSU there. What is at stake is the future of some 80 per cent of the have-nots in this   country.   What is at stake is the 'pillory' of the assets of the nation for private aggrandisement.   Arun Ghosh \n"

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 02/24/2000 05:01 PM ---Pinnamaneni Krishnarao02/222/2000 01:10 PMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: News article on Enron   India: Enron aftermath   Business Line - 02/21/2000   Abhay Mehta   Copyright (C) 2000 Kasturi &amp; Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence Wire   Power Play   A Study of the Enron Project   * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195   THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the   inception of the project proposal in 19992; and the sordid tale ends only in 19997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even   admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 19996, which while commenting that \"This case has   highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence, political considerations outweigh the public interest and   the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to justify its actions not only before the public but even before   the courts of law\" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even   though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.   The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required   evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.   Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological narration - of all events, including the process of bending all   rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of   India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.   It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the   concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'   documents.   All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet   committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to   their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory 'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the   layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the   events of 19991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen   annexes of the small book (of 2226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of factual information. The strange saga of the Enron   project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted   here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to face the problem.   The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the   Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited liability company registered in India, through a maze of   intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front' companies registered in various tax-free havens.   Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount to $ 35 billion (at 19998 exchange rates, around Rs.   1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a) crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than   doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored' figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the   charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 19998 level of prices, was to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents   (per unit) for 'energy costs'.   The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone   up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.   Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 1000 per cent - even though international prices have more than doubled - we   may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a total payment of 111.25 US cents per unit of electricity   supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase I of the project.   Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X 24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at   111.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually; for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.   This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US   dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay   Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign exchange as payment to just one project authority, for   supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.   The really significant point to note in this connection is that this payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase   in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of   the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory; the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government   indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees   extended by both governments.   The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the   Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power   already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 2000   and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit) and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal   power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.   The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.   This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.   It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of   blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,   namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project.

Having refrained at the March OPEC meeting from accepting the Rodriguez adjustment formula to add or withhold 0.5 mbd of oil whenever the price of the OPEC crude basket is above or below $222-28 per barrel for 20 consecutive working days, Saudi Arabia has sought to justify an increase now on the basis of a sustained OPEC basket price above $28 per barrel. The market, however, has moved in opposition to the various OPEC signals, causing the basket price to fall below $28 on July 17, short of the 20-day period. Iran---which adamantly opposes a production increase since it is operating at capacity and would see its oil revenue decline---has led the opposition to the Saudi initiative and is insisting that the conditions specified by the Rodriguez formula have not been met.The oil market continues to react to contradictory statements by OPEC member spokesmen, and on July 18 prices for WTI settled up $1.111 at $31.90 per barrel and prices for Brent increased $0.76 to $29.72. This increase was in reaction to an OPEC signal that it intends to restart the 20-day price period which could delay OPEC action on a production increase by at least four weeks.Uncertainty about an OPEC production increase is the key factor supporting prices. This, in turn, leads to continued pressure on OPEC to implement a 0.5 mbd production increase. The \"20 consecutive day\" mechanism is not, however, a final arbiter of OPEC production policy. For OPEC members who are amenable to the Saudi view on production, the mechanism is more likely to be used as a rough gauge of the global market and not as an automatic trigger to implement or---as the case may be---to delay a supply increase. In addition, the Saudis are capable of acting on their own in the old-fashioned way---quietly further increasing output above their quota. More OPEC gyrations are coming---including the Secretary General's impending visit to Caracas---but, unless the market settles beneath OPEC's upper limit soon, we expect that some additional OPEC oil will be produced, however the increase may be justified.***end***Follow URL for HTML version of this message only.Note: Should the above URL not work, please use the following: http:///www.cera.com/client/wo/alt/0718000_18/wo_alt_0718000_18_ab.html***Account ChangesTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mailaddress, etc. go to: http:///eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfmThis electronic message and attachments, if any, contain informationfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nJohn,I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and elimination ofrisks through hedges (as correctly pointed out   in other messages). Being aware of riskdoes not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.Now a few more detailed comments.1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined with a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view,should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without sufficient depth.One should apply a haircut if liquidating   a position takes a long time. The approach used in valuationof the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of investments in physicalassets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity   is recognized through other aspectsof valuation technology used in RAROC. If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent and usethis approach   across the board for all project finance type cases (not that I recommend this course of action).2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the floor forthe valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as opposed to taking a volrisk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes fuzzy.The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on two factors:1. risk preference2. existing portfolio positionsRisk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that consists of two parts:expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 standard deviations.The number of   standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability to absorb the loss.I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We looked into insurance pricing at therequest of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more about it.Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease the risk of the overall portfolio.I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not look to me as a deal that reduces risk(given all our positions in this region).What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the utility function of a decision makerin technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary. If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged,we should subtract from the value of the contractthe value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value).If we don't price this option explicitly,the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk premium.In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot hedge, he should recognize the riskof losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of the option.How big is the discount? See the comments above. In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton paradigm applies, both valueswill become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form the point of view of a seller and a buyer will converge.3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will recognize the downside and/orupside at different points in time in different states of the world).If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of NPV as of today.Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases we are still holdingit. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is equivalent to using a discount rate with a risk premium.I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a delay in respondingto this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we all agree.It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not havegood answers. Vince\n"

Consistent with these objectives and with the=\r=20\rcorporate goal of fostering =01&amp;One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=\re=20\rfollowing organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=\r=20\rCommercial Transactions Group within ENA.\r 1) Coverage/Origination:\r To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=\r=20\rtechnology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20\rbusinesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=\r=20\runder the leadership of Dave Delainey :\ra) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=\r=20\rco-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;\rb) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=\r=20\rbroad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20\rincluding   pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=\rd=20\rmining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=\r=20\rtextiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20\rCoverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.\r Downstream Coverage/Origination\r As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=\rt=20\rthe heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=\r=20\rENA and Enron Corp.   Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=\r=20\rits industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20\rsolutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=\r=20\rCorp.   Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=\r=20\rwill expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=\rgy=20\rcommodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=\res=20\rbut also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=\rals,=20\rplastics and refined products risk management capability.   These additional=\r=20\rcapabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=\r=20\rgroups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=\r=20\rwill be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20\rleadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=\r=20\rsub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:\ra) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=\r=20\ractivities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=\ror=20\rthe provision of innovative=20\rproducts and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=\rn=20\rof paper risk management products;\rb) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=\ro=20\rlead the coverage activities in this business.   This group will be=20\rresponsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20\rchemicals and refined products industries;\rc) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=\r=20\rTrust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=\r the=20\rcoverage activities in this business.   This group will be responsible for t=\rhe=20\rprovision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20\rheavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=\rs=20\rand glass manufacturing industries.\r   Midstream Coverage/Origination\r a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=\rn=20\renergy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20\rutilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=\r=20\rInterconnect. We have asked   Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=\rs=20\rgroup;\rb) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =\ron=20\renergy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20\rutilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=\ry=20\rwill also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20\ropportunities in the Western U.S.   We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=\r=20\rleadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20\rCalgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=\rs;\rc) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=\rocus on=20\rthe provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20\remerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=\rhant=20\rpower generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =\r=20\rMike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.   In addition, Mike will=\r=20\rcontinue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20\rInterconnect;\rd) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=\ring=20\ropportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20\rrestructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.   We hav=\re=20\rasked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20\rformerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=\r=20\rCitizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=\r=20\rthis newly formed business.\r 2) Commercial Transactions:=20\r The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20\rDonahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=\r=20\rtransactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=\recuting=20\rtransactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=\r=20\rof client coverage.   CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20\rDevelopment, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20\rStructuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=\r=20\rAnalysis and Upstream Asset Management.\r The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=\r=20\rexecution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=\r=20\rwith the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=\r=20\rwhich will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.   This=\r=20\rdedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=\r=20\rand greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20\rresources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=\r=20\rthe highest value transactions across the coverage functions:\r a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=\r=20\rWestern Coverage/Origination Groups.   The senior members of this group=20\rinclude Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=\r=20\rLemmons joined Enron in 19992.   Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=\r=20\rCapital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=\r=20\rfrom Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20\rorigination.\rb) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=\rial=20\rorigination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20\rEnvironmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=\r=20\restablished.   The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=\r=20\rBoudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.   We anticipate announcing=\r=20\rtwo to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.\rc) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=\r=20\rServices and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.   The seni=\ror=20\rmembers of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=\rnd=20\rJohn House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 19996. Most recently, he was the=\r=20\rVice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.   We=\r=20\ranticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=\r=20\rweeks.\rd) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20\rFinance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.   The senior members of this team inclu=\rde=20\rBrad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.   We hope to announce the addition=\r=20\rof at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.\r Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=\r=20\rDownstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=\r=20\rresponsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.   Andrea Reed will=\r=20\rcontinue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=\r=20\rcommercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=\rl=20\rresponsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20\rCapital Structuring Group.   The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=\rn=20\rlargely unchanged.   In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20\rDevelopment teams and their respective origination groups will be located=\r=20\rtogether.\r We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=\re=20\rand industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=\ral=20\rmarkets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=\ren=20\rthe Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20\r Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=\rth=20\rAmerica by working with us to implement these changes.\r\n"

Enron employees, who provide all of the=20\rfunding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,=20\rbecoming one of the largest corporate PACs.   This year we face a new=20\rchallenge.   With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal=20\remployee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent=20\rcontributors.   We are seeking your support.   If you are not a member, pleas=\re=20\rjoin.   If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your=20\rcontribution.\r The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public=20\rpolicy.   Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both=\r=20\rparties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.   Amoun=\rts=20\rcontributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with=\r=20\rfederal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal=20\rElection Campaign Act.   While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee=20\rcontributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of=20\rthose who oppose these ideals.\r This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of=\r=20\rour businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of=20\re-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,=20\rinternational trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and=\r=20\rstate decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants an=\rd=20\ra variety of environmental and tax issues.   Enron has a long and successful=\r=20\rtrack record of supporting and advancing good public policy.   That track=20\rrecord depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers=\r. =20\rThe PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters ca=\rre=20\rabout what they are doing.\r One of the best things about Enron is that we don=01,t just take things as =\rthey=20\rare.   We challenge the status quo.   We ask why.   We change things.   The PAC=\r=20\rhelps us do that.   We need you to help the PAC.   Sign up today - and please=\r=20\rconsider the following contribution guidelines:\r Manager   $5000/year\rDirector   $750/year\rSr. Director/General Manager   $1,000/year\rVice President   $2,5000/year\rSr. VP/Managing Director   $3,5000/year\rExecutive Committee   $5,000/year\r All contributions are voluntary and these guidelines are merely suggestions=\r. =20\rYou are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and=\r=20\rEnron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of thei=\rr=20\rcontribution or their decision not to contribute.   You may refuse to=20\rcontribute without fear of reprisal.\r Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to=\r=20\rthe Enron PAC.   The maximum contribution is $5,000 per year per individual.=\r =20\rAn individual may not contribute more than $25,000 to all federal candidate=\rs=20\rand committees within a calendar year.   The law requires that Enron report=\r=20\rname, address, employer and occupation for every person who contributes ove=\rr=20\r$2000/year.\r No portion of any contribution is deductible as a charitable contribution f=\ror=20\rfederal income tax purposes.\r Thanks for your support!

I reckon these models can be checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets) and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.   I became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the forecasts are accurately reflecting this.   Please see graphs below:Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just copied the 2.3% number forward).   Because the auto-regressive error term is not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable confidence.   As I mentioned, I don't think we can really run this model more than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!Regards,Anjamx35383PLLU:   DZCV: \n"

Please see graphs below:Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just copied the 2.3% number forward).   Because the auto-regressive error term is not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable confidence.   As I mentioned, I don't think we can really run this model more than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!Regards,Anjamx35383PLLU:   DZCV: \n"

You will also no doubt receive copies via our main mailing campaign.In the interim, please find attached a shortened pdf copy of the conference brochure for your perusal. (I did not want to send you the complete 12 pages as it would clog up your email!) The full colour version can be found on our website at ww.icbi.uk.com/poweriskI hope you agree that the speaker plenum and line-up of topics is possibly one of the best ever and not surprisingly the event is already drawing strong international interest. In particular the Executive Summit Day on e-Business and Power Trading is taking numerous bookings. I would be happy for you to attend either the Summit Day or one of our two intensive post conference workshops, but in order to avoid overcrowding on the day ask that all reservations be made in advance.I am certain that you have friends or colleagues who would be interested in attending the conference this year, and would like to ask that you email the enclosed details to them. To make things easy, I have attached a booking form which should be faxed to +444 20 7915 5101. ICBI would be happy to offer a 10% discount on registrations received through speaker recommendations.Finally for any enquiries relating to travel or hotel matters please contact our logistics manager Clare Capel on +444 20 7915 5198. Of course for any programme related issues, please drop me an email or call me on +444 20 7915 5194.I look forward to seeing you in October for what promises to be excellent and informative week.Kind regardsRosemary FitzgeraldDirector, PoweRisk 2000+444 20 7915 5194Fax: +444 20 7915 5101Email: rosef@icbi.co.uk   ! - PoweriskA3000.pdf - speakerreg.doc\n"

I don't mean to put you on the spot, andhave not announced anything in class, but I am hoping that you could visitmy class for about an hour one Thursday afternoon to discuss your viewsregarding applications of option pricing concepts to \"real options\".   As areminder, I've attached a course outline.   Chris Kenyon from Schlumberger isspeaking on April 13, and Vince Kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak onApril 20. I am going to be out of town on April 27, so that leaves either nextThursday (April 6) or May 4.   Would either of those times work for you?   I'mnot thinking of any preparation, but more of an informal discussion of the\"philosophical issues\" related to real options work. Jim---Original Message---From: Jim DyerSent: Thursday, March 30, 2000 1:24 PMTo: 'jclevenger@optionii.bus.utexas.edu'Subject: RE: Real Options Course FeedbackJosh, Some very thoughtful observations.   As you know, I had invited onefinance professor to our class on Arundel, but he was out of town.   I doplan to invite Sheridan Titman to discuss the issue of using the optionmodels in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded.I do think it is important to face that issue, which is actually covered ata theoretical level in our last couple of readings. The issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for furtherdiscussion, as you suggest.   So far, we've been looking at cases wherevolatility is \"given\".   The problem of finding an \"objective\" measure ofvolatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correctrisk adjusted discount rate, which is not surprising since the concepts arealmost two sides of the same plate.   One approach, of course, is to do somemodeling using traditional decision analysis tools, including subjectiveprobabilities, but the finance people who write options articles don't liketo think   about such ideas. I'll try to address these issues in more detail as the semestercontinues.   I think it was important to surface some of these points early,and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in anaive sort of way. Thanks for the feedback and comments.

I also realize thatrightly so, real-world application of this type of analysis without a robustunderstanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptionsthatresult in a \"house of cards\" effect.   My opinion at this point is that twoissues are of potentially \"make-or-brake\" importance if I am to persuade mysuperiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm ofprojectswhose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed byfinancialinstruments.   These issues are easy to guess:1)   Discounting and Risk Free rates:   I do not sense that anyone in theclasshas put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of timevaluequestions in the absence of liquidity.   Is there someone within the financedepartment that can present a firmer position on this question?2)   Volatility: I found Winston's examples on this metric succinct.   I wouldrecommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to thissubject.   My criticism again relates to messy problems.   I anticipateargumentsagainst real option applications based on the dispute of volatilitymeasures.If I were a conservative financial manager, I would argue that:*** Two-a: implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice ofequityoptions is a shotgun approach --- the projects being valued are of a tranchewhich may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than theweighted average measured by the equities utilized.   Oil, gas and electrictyaregood examples the major players are competing on many different levels ofthevalue chain. Smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata,butwhat about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in avertically integrated company?*** Two-b: based on the following skepticism - if a real option value isbeingproposed for a new business venture (some new unexploited opportunity,)there issome paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in newventures and the high risk of failure.   This skepticism is likely to be lessacute in high-tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paradedbefore us daily by NASDQ touts.   It is a much harder sell to \"mature\"industries.Of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered aroundopportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gassectorsas regulation is removed.   A large proportion of the risk is embedded inongoingchanges of public policy on an international basis.   As an intentionallyscrewed-up example, can anyone other than a financial genius correctly assesvolatility for U.S. companies investing in seed projects in Mexico based onspeculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility (CFE) andPEMEX?James S.

We can tweak these however we feel appropriate to match Cal Berkeley on Monday.   I believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students (based on interest shown at the Career Fair).   These tend to be fairly informal.   I was thinking that we could present in this order:Vince   Gives the Enron overview presentation   (30 minutes)John   Gives the Global Technology specific presentation (20 minutes) Ashley   Goes over recruiting information at the end (10 minutes)Please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you feel comfortable with the layout and content.   I am meeting with John today at 1:30 - Vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that would be great.If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. 3-3589Thanks,AshleyVince, here is a copy of the current Enron overview presentation.   There are also speaker notes that go into great detail.   John, here is a copy of the current technology presentation for Carnegie Mellon.   The only changes will be to the recruiting dates at the end.   There are also speaker notes that go into greater detail.   ---&lt;\n"

His last pay raise and bonus were in September 1999 and he is expecting a raise and a bonus this September. The offer we would like to give him ($85-90K base) is obviously way below his expectations.

The following points come out1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 19997 and end 19998 when the ratio was c1.5x.3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal significantly.   Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in share prices in the last yearJust to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market value ratio is a straight average.   Obviously that influences the numbers a little.On CustomerCo.   CSFB have contacted around 7 energy companies.   The result has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise.   I await a revised fee proposal but CSFB have been advised that it should be more modest than the last one !Keith   ---Original Message---From:   David Kitchener   Sent: 03 August 2000 13:27To: Keith HarrisSubject: Amended Index Graph\n"

It is seeking vehicles on which&lt; to&lt; build&lt;   business-to-business (B2B) platforms in sectors such&lt; as&lt; logistics, chemicals,&lt;   agricultural products and pulp &amp; paper.&lt;&lt;   Mr Skilling wants to take the business model the&lt; company&lt; developed in&lt;   natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale&lt; commodity markets. He&lt;   argues the electronic platforms it creates will not&lt; only&lt; become the principal&lt;   B2B sites for those sectors, but reshape those&lt; industries.&lt;&lt;   As an example, he points to Enron's new e-commerce&lt; platform,&lt;   EnronOnline,&lt;   which has changed the way the company does business&lt; with its&lt;   customers&lt;   while significantly increasing sales.&lt;&lt;   The company - the largest wholesale merchant of&lt; natural gas&lt; and power - saw&lt;   wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53&lt; per&lt; cent in the first&lt;   quarter.&lt;&lt;   Critics argue that Enron's move away from its familiar&lt; energy business into&lt;   new industries, where the learning curve is steep and&lt; the&lt; competition&lt;   entrenched, is risky. Yet a number of industry&lt; analysts&lt; point out Enron has&lt;   proved it understands markets and how to manage risks&lt; while&lt; becoming the&lt;   largest importer of coal in the UK, the largest trader&lt; of&lt; gas and power in the&lt;   US and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth.&lt;&lt;   \"It's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in&lt; an&lt; orderly way,\" says Ronald&lt;   Barone, analyst with Paine-Webber in New York. \"What&lt; they're&lt;   doing here is&lt;   what they've been incredibly successful at doing,\" he&lt; adds,&lt; noting that Enron&lt;   posted Dollars 1.3bn in earnings before interest and&lt; taxes&lt; (ebit) from its&lt;   wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34&lt; per&lt; cent from the&lt;   previous year.&lt;&lt;   Earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds&lt; of the&lt; company's overall&lt;   income before interest and taxes last year, and Mr&lt; Barone&lt; sees the unit's ebit&lt;   increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years.&lt;&lt;   As with gas and power and now broadband, where Enron&lt; is&lt; standardising&lt;   contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants&lt; to&lt; create markets by&lt;   entering as a physical player and providing merchant,&lt; risk&lt; management and&lt;   financial services over the internet.&lt;&lt;   \"We will provide electronic commerce, but we will&lt; provide&lt; liquidity and we will&lt;   provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract,\"&lt; Mr&lt; Skilling says. \"That is an&lt;   extremely powerful model. If you look at other B2B&lt; sites,&lt; they don't do that.\"&lt;&lt;   Mr Skilling argues Enron's e-commerce platform will&lt; triumph&lt; over the other,&lt;   bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal&lt; depends&lt;   on two parties&lt;   hooking up and working through uncertainties over&lt; timing,&lt; price, credit and&lt;   fulfilment.&lt;&lt;   Not everyone shares that view. Some energy companies,&lt; for&lt; example, would&lt;   rather not do business with a competitor. BP Amoco&lt; recently&lt; purchased a 3&lt;   per cent stake in Altra Energy Technologies, a&lt; Houston-&lt; based, neutral&lt;   wholesale energy exchange. With Koch Industries and&lt; American&lt;   Electric&lt;   Power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume&lt; of&lt; transactions on the&lt;   site to lend it liquidity.&lt;&lt;   Just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals,&lt; Enron&lt;   believes it&lt;   needs networks of strategic physical assets. In&lt; acquiring&lt; MG, Enron got a&lt;   stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical&lt; position.&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"It should provide (MG) with a more vibrant, more&lt; active&lt; physical spot market&lt;   in more markets in the world,\" says Greg Whalley,&lt; chief&lt; executive officer of&lt;   Enron Net Works, the new division Enron is launching&lt; to&lt; identify and enter&lt;   commodity markets. He argues that in metals and other&lt; markets, Enron will&lt;   deliver better pricing, price risk management&lt; services,&lt; cross-commodity&lt;   transactions and flexible transactions for a wider&lt; range of&lt; customers.&lt;&lt;   Mr Skilling says there are significant rewards for&lt; restructuring an industry.&lt;&lt;   \"If you can take that platform, and you use the&lt; capabilities&lt;   the bricks bring to&lt;   the table, e-commerce the industry and change the&lt; structure,&lt;   you're selling for&lt;   more than a 50 multiple.\"&lt;&lt;   Copyright , The Financial Times Limited&lt; \n"

The employee reward system is based on P&amp;Ls as well as the creation ofnew business.7. Most employees have stock options.I really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with Vince again the next timeI'm in Houston.\n"

The talk \"A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation,\" scheduled forThursday, May 111th, from 10:30 am to 12:000 pm.I am running behind schedule in finalizing this program, so I will give youa call shortly to follow up with you.

Model should be for a particular market. Examples: PJM, Chicago, ECAR,Southern California.1B (optional). Model should be for a particular purpose. Examples: valuing anew combustion turbine at the Florida/Georgia border, bidding on a portfolioof power plants up for sale in NEPOOL, valuing a retail portfolio inPennsylvania.2.   Model should be estimated on a particular data set. Examples: dailyNYMEXclose prices for Palo Verde, PJM hourly spot prices for 19998-1999.3.   Case study should describe several candidate models, for volatilityand/or market price, that were considered. Case study should discuss whythese models were considered. Candidate models should be describedmathematically and verbally.4.   Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitlyidentified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluationcriteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,Akaike information criterion.5.   Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. Theestimation procedure employed should be briefly described.6.   Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.7.   If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.Generally, the case study should include all of the items above. The casestudy may include other things.\n"

As I understand, the payoff to the customer is a fixed cash amount that wil be paid if the average of the closing prices of aluminium for a month are greater than the strike agreed in advance, where holiday days do not contribute to the average.Russell mentioned that this would be a set of 12 monthly options starting in Jan-01, and that the LME price for Jan-01 of $1572.5 (which is the future converging to the spot price on the 3rd Wednesday in Jan 01) can be used as a proxy/estimate for the average for the month.Do you have a model for asian digitals or should I proceed with Monte Carlo to price this, maybe using European digital option model as control variate?Thanks,Anjamx35383\n"

The customer pays for the minimum (baseload) bandwidth they need for their (say) videoconference, with a premium on top that automatically buys them extra bandwidth as it becomes available from the system.   They are guaranteed a minimum quality they can live with, and (more than likely) they get improved quality much of the time for a bargain price.We get to charge for the use of bandwidth that would otherwise be idle.SteveVince J Kaminski05/111/2000 02:09 PMTo: Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Bandwidth+++   Steve,I think personally it's a great idea, though my son, who studiescomputer science, poured a bucket of icy water on me.

Such a proposal would have natural synergies with the bandwidth business, since the jobs to be processed would need to be piped around, as would their results.Obvious technical and legal problems are:1.   Standardisation.   (Java?)2. Security and confidentiality.Just a thought that's been buzzing around my head for a while.Steve\n"

I talked this overwith Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowedtwo (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business andnot have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence.If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled),please let me know when you are going to take these days.   If an emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you are taking a personal day.   It will be coded on your time sheet.These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, \"funeral leave\", \"family leave\", or \"civic duty leave\".   They are just a way of being able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise.   These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by all of us.If you have any questions, please call me.Shirley3-5290\n"

It includes a lengthyintroduction that effectively frames risk managementprogress, advancements and innovations that startedin the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to thenatural gas and most recently expanding to theelectricity industry.Managing Energy Price Risk is comprised of 15chapters, all of which include an introduction, whichminimises the disjointedness that you may expect froma book written by a large number of authors. Otherimprovements in this second edition include expandedgraphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and aseparate glossary, which provides the reader withadditional reference material.In particular the chapter on energy options written byMichael Hampton is a useful primer and provides thereader with a concise explanation of option theory,pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practicalguidelines for distinguishing between hedging and purespeculation. For the more advanced reader, thechapter on Energy Exotic Options, written by VinceKaminski, Stinson Gibner and Krishnarao Pinnamaneni isparticularly strong as it outlines the challengesassociated with the exotics and effectively documentsthe latest methods used by leading practitioners inpricing such instruments.Additionally, the chapter on Accounting for DerivativeContracts in the Energy Environment by threeconsultants from Arthur Anderson, is a well writtensummary which addresses the numerous tax relatedissues including a timely discussion on the US FinancialAccounting Standards Board's Statement 1333 (seeEPRM October 1999, page 222). Having this taxinformation housed in one concise chapter is of greatvalue.The second edition however is not without flaws. Inparticular, it would have been useful to have moreinformation on the current challenges risk managersare confronted with in the power industry includinglatest advancements in volatility and correlationestimation techniques. Additional attention could havealso been placed on the shortcomings of the currentmarket structure and methods in finding and applyingappropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In thefledgling power market, this continues to be one of theprimary challenges.In summary, this second edition of Managing EnergyPrice Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in theprior edition and is a valuable reference book for thenew recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcomeedition to any risk management library.\n"

Additional attention could havealso been placed on the shortcomings of the currentmarket structure and methods in finding and applyingappropriate hedging strategies and instruments. In thefledgling power market, this continues to be one of theprimary challenges.In summary, this second edition of Managing EnergyPrice Risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in theprior edition and is a valuable reference book for thenew recruit or seasoned veteran. It is a welcomeedition to any risk management library.\n"

Both the approval of the Large Combustion Plant Directive by EU environment ministers and the agreement on German nuclear phaseout between the German government and industry could involve the early removal of existing, low-cost generating plants from the European power capital stock in the 2010-15 time period and their subsequent replacement by natural gas-fired turbines.***end*** Please see attachment for complete Alert.

        " Joseph Hrgovcic/HOU/ECT on 04/05/2000 04:06 PM ---Lucy Ortiz04/05/2000 04:02 PMTo: Joseph Hrgovcic/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: CME and CATEXSpotlight Report   Exchange products seeing slow trading   GAVIN SOUTER   03/20/2000   Business Insurance   Page 3   Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights   reserved.   Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have   been somewhat slow to get off the ground.   Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since   the mid-19990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a   significant volume of trades.   Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away   from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains   abundant and relatively cheap.   As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major   natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will   remain limited, observers say.   Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the   limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he   said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one   contract against another.   Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to   establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has   not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,   capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in   New York.   The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not   offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way   to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified   portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently   offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that   hedge, he said.   Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then   hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.   stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane   explained.   The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to   natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he   said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop   indexes, Mr. Lane said. \"For the insurance buyer, such exchange   instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but   as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a   good surrogate,\" he said.   The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for   over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of   catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.   The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of   exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior   vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter &amp; Co., the reinsurance   brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.   \"The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not   looking for other ways of doing business,\" he said.   At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar   to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success   since they were introduced in the 1970s. \"There is a belief that   alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to   predict when,\" Mr. Mooney said.   Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves   established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not   brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.   Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities   Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,   however, and was suspended last year after two years of little   activity.   The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative   products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board   of Trade, which began trading the options in 19996.   Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft   traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge   catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker   at the CBOT who trades in options.   No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT   so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in   the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were   traded, Mr. Purty said.   \"I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they   really take off,\" he said.   The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to   trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance   markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative   coverage options, Mr. Purty said.   The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has   radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in   mid-19996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,   chief operating officer.   CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for   reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks   and to build balanced portfolios.   But by the time the exchange was operational in November 19996, it   was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX   wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney   said.   Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of   risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.   Sweeney said.   Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a \"cash for cover\"   exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange   include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability   coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where   coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry   loss over an agreed threshold.   Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible   through the Internet in November 19998. And late last year, CATEX   offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them   form groups whose members do business only with one another.   Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,   totaling $4000 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,   he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,   insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their   captives, Mr. Sweeney said.   \"We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied   with what we have achieved so far,\" Mr. Sweeney said.   The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents   seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their   existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was   a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last   year.   Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field   of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather   derivatives .   Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry   Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.   Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against   weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in   a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a   resultant fall in revenues.   The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,   Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,   Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering   contracts based on cold weather.   Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers   themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more   extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.   In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for   over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. \n"

Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,5000 - this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonusIncrease the value of options to o60K   to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.   Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.

Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,5000 - this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonusIncrease the value of options to o60K   to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.   Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.

This will be used on our website and be published later in time. Could you please - if you have the time - contact and maybe work with Bijoya to draft this White Paper? Bryan is in Houston today and may be able to give a better idea of what he is exactly looking for ... Otherwise, he will be in London again next week.

It then states in Article 3 that the fees are set forth in Appendix 1, but there are no prices in Appendix 1.   I have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going to prepare it as we usually do to send to Mark Holsworth for review.   In the meantime, do you want me to go back to Ms. Geman and ask her for more detailed pricing information or do you have what you need?   Also, in Appendix 2, you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to have.   Please let me know.Thanks,Karla---"

I realize that you have estabilished such differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be moved up a notch in the case of EBS.Ravi.\n"

I was wondering if you orsomeone you know at Enron would be interested in participating in such ameeting.   I realize that you may not be able to plan this far in advanceand would certainly not be offended in the least if you cannot participate.

I'll see what becomes of the session and keep youinformed.   As to the paper, Tim Crack and I have a revised version of thepaper I gave you.   We have since found out that by using certaintyequivalence, our model is more robust.   For example, if one has an assetpricing model that incorporates mean, variance, and skewness (Harvey andSiddique, JF June, 2000) and a binomial model that incorporates mean,variance, and skewness (Johnson, Paulukiewicz, and Mehta, RQFA, 19997), ourmodel allows you to price options under the real world measure.   Thebenefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historicaldata that is non-risk neutralized.   From a pricing perspective, there isn't a tremendous benefit in amean-variance world (variance stays the same in risk neutral or riskymeasure).   However,in the mean-variance-skewness world, there is a benefitbecause we do not believe (although we're still hunting down an appropriatecite) skewness is the same under risk-neutral and risky measure.   Given wecan only measure the skewness in our risky world, our model becomes muchmore significant.   I would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper youhave and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would liketo see it.Thanks again,Tom \n"

Please re-read the following memo and respond to Ted by July 31, 2000.Thanks in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.As you know the ENA OTC is actively working with the Analyst and Associate Program to develop greater talent flow into ENA.   We are presently working on a number of initiatives to improve how this is working and significantly improve communication flow and responsiveness. However in this regard we also need you to help make sure we have clear lines of communication within ENA   regarding A&amp;A resource levels, performance, rotations and retention efforts.In this regard we would like for each of you to take the lead   for your groups needs and ensure that any requests, questions or concerns about A&amp;A's in your area are passed through you to either Ted Bland (ENA Recuitment Team Lead - x35275) or Jana Giovannani (ENA liaison from the AA Program - x392333) or myself. It is important that we are discerning about what we do with our A&amp;A resources and plan carefully and accurately for our future needs, in this regard we need for you personally (or a senior member of your team who you may optionally delegate this task to) will take the time to review any A&amp;A resource requests from your team before passing them onto us.In addition, given the importance of these resources, we will be inviting you to a regular bi-monthly meeting to discuss ENA A&amp;A matters. We will confirm the first date in due course. In the meantime if you would like to volunteer another senior member of your team to assume this reponsibility please supply their name as soon as possible. Please call with any questions.\n"

      "body": "\nChris,This is very well written and will serve the reader well. A few comments.1. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the classification based on 3 categories: a. variance/covariance   method   b. historical simulation   c. Monte Carlo simulation.Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear instrument.2. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation of behavior ofall the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio.The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor's expansion) that may involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the samemodel that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).The main benefit of using the   MC simulation in the energy markets is the ability to capturethe gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way. I would emphasize thatthere are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you the references from home).3. I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets that are evolvingquickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices,behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).4. For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of aggregation into atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.This process may be a source of a big error.5. The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessingof a portfolio that introduces no error. Many swaps with the same underlyingcan be aggregated into one positions ( they are   portfolios of forwards and they are linearinstruments).Please, feel free to use any comment (or none).Vince\"Chris Strickland\" &lt;chris@lacima.co.uk&lt; on 08/28/2000 02:58:56 PMPlease respond to \"Chris Strickland\" &lt;chris@lacima.co.uk&lt;To: &lt;vince.j.kaminski@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: EPRM articleDear Vince,?D you think you might be able to look at this in   the next day or so?

Note that \"most recent\" still dates it back a few years.   A couple caveats:   I did try to clean it up somewhat from old macros, but no guarntees offered.   Also, some of the underlying methodology is not what we would probably currently use, such as for pricing, stochastic processes, and perhaps decline rates.   Please let me know if I can provide any additional help.Mark\n"

Daniel Waltz, of the law firm Patton Boggs LLP, is a leading expert on the EEA and will deliver what promises to be an interesting and informative segment.   Congress passed the EEA in 19996, and it will increasingly shape how corporate America collects, uses, and protects valued information.   In addition to explaining some of the intricacies of the EEA, Dan Waltz will include \"hypothetical\" corporate case studies (some actually torn from the headlines) to illustrate his points.This event is sponsored by ENA's Competitive Analysis and Business Controls (CABC) group and is supported by ENA legal.   This event kicks-off CABC's Competitive Intelligence Standards Program, which seeks to raise awareness of issues relevant both to Enron's practitioners and senior consumers of competitive intelligence.   This particular speaking engagement is designed to raise awareness of the EEA's legal guidelines, as well as to stimulate thought both on the collection opportunities against our competitors as well as how we might better protect Enron's own proprietary information.   I believe the topic of the EEA is especially relevant, given that we find ourselves amidst the big bang of this new information age.   All CABC staff is being asked to attend this presentation, and we are inviting a small number of other Enron employees who are engaged in aspects of serious competitive intelligence.   Select executives like yourselves are being invited to attend, and I would welcome any suggestions of others that you think might benefit from attending this event.   The EEA presentation is set for August 15, 1:30-3:000 PM, in the 50th floor Conference room.   Please RSVP to either myself or Sharon Purswell.   Hope to see you there. P.S.   By the way, our next speaker segment in the CI Standards Program will concentrate on the guidelines and implications of the \"Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA),\" and will likely be scheduled for the fall.\n"

It's not surprising that someone who is as busyas Dr. Kaminski is running a bit behind.   I've organized a number ofconferences, and it always turns out that the best speaker is the last oneto get his presentation ready.   We are very lucky to have him speak at ourconference, and I am happy to help.There will be an SVGA data projector with an LCD colour data projector andscreen available.If he would like the conference participants to have copies of his materialduring his presentation, perhaps he could take it to the hotel's 24-hourbusiness services area when he arrives (or when it's ready) and I will pickup the copies before registration begins at 8:000.   If he doesn't mind mewaiting to distribute the copies on the first break, I can take care of thecopying once everyone is seated and his talk begins.If he chooses to have the copies ready first thing in the morning, pleasehave him request 555 (three-hole punched) copies to be charged to theUniversity of Waterloo's function.   If it's all right to hand them outlater, he can bring me the diskette when he comes down to the Stuartmeeting room on the third floor.   I will be there for registration andcontinental breakfast beginning at 8:000.Please let me know which he prefers.Thanks!AmyAt 111:10 AM 5/25/000 -05000, you wrote:&lt;&lt;Hi Amy:&lt;&lt;Just checking on a few last minute details.

They nolonger work, probably because I haven't visited the site in months as wewere in full development mode on Energycast.Vince, you will note in our website references to forward prices of power inNepool, NYPP, and PJM. We use Reuters as a reference --- not satisfactory. Ifyour traders like Energycast and Enron became a client, would Enron considerlinking its prices to our site? We have to improve over the Reuters quotesand regard Enrononline or Bloomberg as the best candidates. Over time, asour service spreads I believe this could help generate deal flow for yourtraders.Let me know what you think.Ed\n"

NOWA SARZYNA, Poland --- From a small power plant humming among thebirches near the Ukrainian border, Enron Corp. has staked its claim onthe Polish energy market.   Yet after six years, the company is still seeking a mother lode.   The Houston-based energy producer and trader entered Poland in 19994,nabbed one of the first power-trading licenses to go to a foreigncompany and began work on Elektrocieplownie Nowa Sarzyna, Poland's firstnew, foreign-operated heat-and-power plant.   Other companies followed, including Electricite de France, RWE AG ofGermany, Vattenfall AB of Sweden and Tractebel SA of Belgium.   The prize could be a rich one. All of these companies hope to profitas Poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joiningthe European Union.   A wholesale power bourse is due to open in Warsaw in July. And thecountry's transmission links to markets East and West could make Polandthe power-trading hub of Central Europe.   But after six years in Poland, Enron has yet to earn a profit. Netincome from Nowa Sarzyna, which is to begin commercial production laterthis month, is at least five years away. Power-trading operations mightgenerate profits next year, if the new bourse gets moving. But that is\"one big question mark,\" says Jarek Astramowicz, Enron Poland'spresident.   Indeed, despite its promise, Poland's energy sector remains asizzling tangle of aging plants, archaic market agreements and complex,shifting regulations.   Enron, with $40 billion (41.69 billion euros) in annual revenue, isan innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers. But in a powermarket as negatively charged as Poland's, the company also is an exampleof how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitorsoffline.   \"These are very large operations and to some extent they can bearsome risks,\" says Pawel Kaminski, energy-sector operations officer atthe World Bank in Warsaw. \"But eventually they have to generate somereturn.\"   Enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the U.S. Itentered Europe in 1989, setting up in London as the U.K.'s energy sectorliberalized. It entered the Nordic market in 19996, and today is the NordPool's largest-volume trader.   Enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permitsfor a power plant, and a further 29 months for construction.   Just four years after entering the U.K., Enron finished its1,875-megawatt Teesside plant. Teesside's capacity and cost, at GBP 795million (1.32 billion euros), are many times larger than Nowa Sarzyna's.Yet Teesside was completed in only two-thirds the time. The companydeclines to compare development times in various countries.   \"I wouldn't necessarily put Poland into the same category as Russia,\"says Philip Davies, regulatory and government-affairs manager at EnronEurope in London. \"But obviously, given Poland's (planned economy) past,it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory processand get to the starting point.\"   At Nowa Sarzyna, it took Enron nearly twice the usual time to reachthe starting point, even though Mr. Astramowicz already knew the site,and the Polish power industry's rules.   The Nowa Sarzyna plant was Mr. Astramowicz's brainchild, and heburned out the engine in his first BMW as he traveled between Warsaw andthe town to craft the deal. A freelance energy-sector entrepreneurbefore joining Enron, Mr. Astramowicz sold his interest in Nowa Sarzynato Enron in 19998.   Enron has spent $132 million to build Nowa Sarzyna, a 1116-megawatt,gas-fired combined heat-and-power plant. Quiet, clean and efficient, theplant stands in stark contrast to most of Poland's belching, coal-firedbehemoths. When it starts up this month, it will sell its electricity tothe Polish Power Grid, the country's high-voltage network, under a20-year power-purchase agreement, or PPA, that Enron won in 19997. Steamoutput goes to Organika, the chemical company next door, and helps heatthe town of Nowa Sarzyna.   The Nowa Sarzyna plant is more than 80% financed by commercial-bankloans for which the only collateral is the plant's concluded contracts.   \"They were betting on their good name,\" says Michael Davies, apartner with Allen &amp; Overy, the Warsaw law firm that advised EnronPoland's lenders. \"They are pushing envelopes all the time.\"   That is especially true in a market with 30% overcapacity, where anenergy law didn't even exist until 19997.   Says Peter Bisztyga, emerging Europe utilities analyst at SolomonSmith Barney in London: \"Because Enron signed a PPA, they are OK . . .(but) I'm really not sure building Nowa Sarzyna was such a good idea.\"   Mr. Bisztyga says Enron could have generated a faster return byrenovating an existing power plant. But, he acknowledges, Nowa Sarzyna\"allowed Enron to get into the Polish market early and stamp their nameon it.\"   In 19994, Polish power plants weren't for sale. Energy assetprivatization, discussed for years, began in earnest only this year. By20002, the Polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens ofpower plants, 333 distribution companies and the Polish Power Grid, a12,000-kilometer national transmission network of high-voltage lines.The assets have a total book value of 333 billion zlotys (8.4 billioneuros), but murky regulations have driven prices down.   \"The regulations don't promote competition and so you don't reallyknow the price of electricity,\" says Bengt Wegemo, president ofVattenfall Poland. Earlier this year, Vattenfall paid $235 million for555% in Warsaw-based Elektrocieplownie Warszawskie, promising $340million in investment in the heat-and-power plant over the next 10years.   Investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing.Ultimately, 170 licensed energy traders and 2000 large power users willtrade on the bourse, setting the wholesale price of electricity. ThePolish bourse will be modeled on its Nordic counterpart. Enron, the NordPool's largest trader, hopes to post Polish trading profits by 20001.   But first, say market experts, Poland's 19997 energy law must beamended to ease functioning of the bourse, and free up access toPoland's distribution network.   Further, the government says it must solve the competition problemposed by the Polish Power Grid's power-purchase agreements, whichaccount for 70% of energy sales in Poland. Some state-owned plants usedthe agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing. Whenprices are freed, these plants might go bankrupt if forced to competewith plants that didn't spend money to modernize.   The government is contemplating a special fund to compensate themodernized plants for their extra costs. Though Nowa Sarzyna is aprivate plant, the price Enron must charge for its power is about twicewhat outmoded plants charge.   \"We are hoping that continuous, efficient operation of the plant willgenerate us a (bigger) profit,\" Mr. Astramowicz says.   Another problem is cross-border power trading, where contradictorylegislation essentially gives a monopoly to the Polish Power Grid, alsoknown as PSE. Enron and others protest that PSE shouldn't compete withelectricity-market participants who contract with it for transmissionservice.   PSE intends to stay in the trading business, says Marek Zerka, PSE'svice president. In late March, PSE and local company Kulczyk Holdingsigned an agreement with PreussenElektra AG of Germany to exportelectricity and coal to EU countries via Germany.   \"This is great news,\" Mr. Astramowicz says. \"If this joint venturegets access to PSE's cross-border transmission capacity . . . I wouldexpect PSE to confirm open access to all market participants.\"   Enron and others are pushing hard for that access. \"As soon as themarket becomes open, free and non-discriminatory, we will come out at adecent profit,\" Mr. Astramowicz says.Folder Name: Enron in EuropeRelevance Score on Scale of 1000: 78___To review or revise your folder, visit http:///www.djinteractive.com or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 8000-369-74666.

Please explain. - The FX and Country Risk team analyses a host of data and information to forecast foreign exchange curves and predict inflation.   Primarily, we depend on the work of the Institute of International Finance (IIF), we also talk with their staff Senior Ph.D. Economists.   We review the current macroeconomic policy mix including monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies and their sustainability.   We also analyze the balance of payments to make sure their are no pressures on the current account, capital account   or foreign exchange reserves.   In addition, we look at economic output in light of all the above mentioned factors and incorporate our global outlook of global growth and international commodity prices.   Then we determine our expectations for changes to these conditions based on many domestic and international factors.   We also evaluate the progress of   IMF program and the countries ability and willingness to meet the IMF criteria, and whether or not they are in compliance with the Fund.   In addition, we analyze the political risk/stability of the country, timing of elections and or major constitutional or policy changes which would have a major impact on the economy.   We also perform a ratio analysis of a country's ability to repay its debt in the context of debt-to-GDP ratios, debt service, import coverage, FDI-to-current account, etc.   We analyze the stability of the country's banking system, level non-performing loans-to-total, bankruptcy laws, and progress on restructuring bad debts.   All these factors influence the outlook on local price changes and movement of the exchange rate.How often do the curves get updated? - Curves are updated upon request from the Enron business units or RAC.

All these papers included in other RISK books were&lt;written by Enron&lt;employees.&lt;&lt;We would like them included as well, if technically possible.&lt;&lt;&lt;I think that offering other energy related books through our site, in&lt;addition to MEPR2,&lt;is fine, but I would leave the decision to Dan Diamond, who is responsible&lt;for the project.&lt;&lt;&lt;Vince&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Conrad Gardner &lt;conrad@risk.co.uk&lt; on 06/05/2000 07:08:36 AM&lt;&lt;To:   Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com&lt;cc:&lt;Subject:   Enron site/MEPR2&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Date: Mon, 05 Jun 2000 13:02:02&lt;&lt;To: Vince Kaminski&lt;&lt;From: Conrad Gardner &lt;conrad@risk.co.uk&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Dear Vince&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Thanks for the call and email on Friday.

After   working   for   seven   years   on   credit   riskmanagement   in   a   research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer myexperience   in   assessing   credit   risk   modeling,   information   technology   andmethodology   in   complex   top-tier   institutions   to   an   active   credit tradingmanagerial   environment.   I   am   excited   about   being   involved   in   trading,origination, risk management and R&amp;D of credit derivatives.I   have   seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and management.   Ihave   helped   design,   test   and implement credit value-at-risk systems with KMVCorp   and   with   a   major   Japanese   bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV indesigning the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar withits   assumptions,   strengths,   weaknesses and applications.   I did the empiricalresearch   that   lies   behind the KMV default correlation model, the private firmEDF   model   and   I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during thecreation of the CreditMetrics documentation.I   have   excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming skills.I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied creditrisk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.

We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which is currently seeking to IPO.   The issue we are discussing with RAC is which discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to value these optionsFirst, some additional information.Option characteristics:--- 1116,000 options (representing 9% of the company)--- Term:   minimum of 3 years but possibly longer --- still being renegotiated--- Strike price:   20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or Turkish Lire)We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $1118.75 per option but 34,8000 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on December 15, 2000.   The company's investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds) are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at $1118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $3000 million.   Due to such a large \"valuation gap\", they originally encouraged us to exercise all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early Oct).   Our counter-proposal is to \"swap\" instrinsic value for time value by repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to use to value the options.   We are arguing that the US risk free is the most appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company's historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use (although admit that this is not justifiable --- only a proxy)A few key points:--- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this \"to be negotiated\" discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future options intrinsic value in 3 years (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation)--- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return--- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount--- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we obviously do not exercise.We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.   And here is where we reach our difficulty:   since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.   Our argument is that the non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.   As such, we feel RAC's approach is double counting.If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!   I'll give you a call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information.Regards,John Bottomley \n"

He is debating about going to industry or trying to find an academic position after he finishes his Ph.D.   Giving him some incentive to seriously consider Enron now might have an effect on his plans for next year.Regards,Stinson\n"

I'll send it to Shirley for payment once I have it.The products:   @INTEREST, SEAPC, and SEAPP have not been on maintenance for a while.   FEA told us a couple of years ago I believe that they do not have maintenance available for these products any longer.   So, you don't need to worry about cancelling @INTEREST.Also, just FYI - your @ENERGY.1 and @ENERGY.2 licenses have maintenance through 10/20/2000.If you have any questions, please let me know.   Otherwise, I will proceed with contacting FEA about you renewal of the @GLOBAL, SPAV, and SWING licenses.Thanks,Karla\n"

Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and had to be in bed for a long time.In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to another state out of the Dabhol plant.   I have developed the concept whereby we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm power sale during the monsoon.The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.   I am currently in Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.   I maybe needing a surgery for the slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.   I can see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get some help from your end.Regards,Sandeep.---",

Please go through this and run the sensitivities and get a good idea of way to structure thsi.   Having gone through the comments, I feel that it maybe necessary to get some help on the structuring side.   I will try to get you some structuring expertise asap.   In the mean time, I would like you all to focus on getting resources together and working this to the next pass.Lets see where we can get with this.Regards,Sandeep.Rajesh Sivaraman12/24/999 10:06 PMTo: Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENTcc: Vivek Kejriwal/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Shubh Shrivastava/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Anshuman Srivastav/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Firm Power sale from Phase I - IssuesAs discussed, please find enclosed   a word document which essentially discusses most of the issues involved with a Firm Power sale of 50 MW from Phase I, which would have to be sorted out with MSEB. Vivek &amp; I have also worked out a methodology for computing tariff for this firm power sale during the peak period. In doing this, we have tried to keep the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation; will put the tariff formula in the next mail)The tariff structure &amp; the issue list obviously need further refinement, before we discuss it with MSEB.Looking forward to your comments on both the issue list as well as the tariff computation.regards,Rajesh S\n"

Generally,I like it, and find it non-controversialand well written. Of course, this isa huge topic and there are thingsthat you haven't discussed.I thought the amount of attentionpaid to OLS and MLE estimationwas a bit overboard, given that youdidn't really exploit it in yourresults. If you were to statethe likelihood function forthe GARCH model, it might justifythe amount of attention togave to estimation forsimple iid processes, which could thenbe thought of as a simple lead-inand intuition builder tothe more interesting models thatyou do actually use.By the way, in your discussion ofsmiles, you discuss fat tailsextensively. At least for equity markets,while fat tails contribute, they don't do verymuch at all compared to the effectof risk premia, which you allude to briefly,using supply-demand language, at theend of that section.For the impact of risk premia, seeJun Pan's paper, which is availablefrom her web page. But she coversonly SP5000, (as do most studies),and your markets are obviously much different.The chapter will be a good service to your readers!Best, Darrell&lt; X-Lotus-FromDomain: ECT&lt; From: \"Vince J Kaminski\" &lt;Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com&lt;&lt; To: Darrell Duffie &lt;duffie@Stanford.EDU&lt;&lt; cc: \"Grant Masson\" &lt;Grant.Masson@enron.com&lt;, \"Vince J Kaminski\"&lt;Vince.J.Kaminski@enron.com&lt;&lt; Date: Wed, 16 Aug 2000 16:37:53 -05000&lt; Subject: Re: Full version&lt; Mime-Version: 1.0&lt; Content-Disposition: inline&lt; X-UIDL: 000453eda98c82d709e6123af537e4f63&lt; X-Keywords:&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Darrell,&lt;&lt; Thanks a lot.

I think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in his apartment is the increasing cost of his Houston stay.2. It is getting noisier here.

Thanks for yourpatience.Vince   \tEnron Technology \tFrom:   Ashley Baxter @ ENRON   08/30/2000 08:24 AM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Shirley Crenshaw/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Hello from Vince Kaminski at Enron   Vince,Actually, the General Presentation that I have scheduled for the Faculty Club (a dining/meeting room) on campus is set for 7:000 p.m. - 9:000 p.m. on Monday the 16th.   I can attempt to change the presentation date again, however I feel that it would be very unlikely that we are able to get another facility that is near campus.   At this point it may be better to plan on making two seperate trips so that we are able to handle both events.   Maybe we could combine another presentation in during the same visit.

I felt that it would be useful to bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.   I met Melanie this morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in Houston.   I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine from a career progression perspective and Houston Research's to fill an urgent need.   Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.   I expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign assignment representative in the near future.I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.   The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron Corp is too dramatic and requires me to \"burn bridges\" and my return to Enron Europe would be difficult.   Also, I would lose the valuable support structures available to me in London.   The amount of any fixed costs (flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they justify making the contract a three year (local) one.I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience &amp; value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have identified &amp; justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an \"Excellent\" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also \"Excellent\"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my existing Enron Europe salary &amp; benefits package plus a reasonable one-off allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).Regards &amp; thanks again for the opportunity,Anjamx35383\n"

I told them that the deal you and I communicated to Anjam was firm and not negotiable (with the exception of the issues regarding the flat rental).   Apparently, Anjam is trying to play hard ball.   What's your commitment to Anjam?   Should we explore a package deal? My vote is no.Grant.Tara Rozen08/09/2000 12:17 PMTo: Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Melanie Doyle/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Houston Research OpportunityGrantUnfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to convince Anjam that he should transfer on a local US package. The difficulty is not so much the compensation and benefits, it seems more to do with the actual job and long-term prospects. He will only, therefore, commit to 12 months and only on assignment terms. We explained to Anjam the rationales for transferring locally, ie not just cost but equitability among his peers. He is convinced that his skills and Enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a local deal. Also, he was apparently told by Vince that it was impossible for you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market rate. Would you like to move further with this? If so, we can put together costs for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think. I am out tomorrow but back in on Friday and could do it for you then.Let us know!RegardsTara---"

The market developments have created a&lt; number of unique challenges for energy industry economists. One immediate&lt; question we have to answer is how to measure volatility of energy prices.&lt; Although we can all agree that the prices in the power markets are&lt; characterized by high variability, the traditional measures used in financial&lt; economics (annualized standard deviation of log price returns) may not fit&lt; well electricity prices. The second challenge is to explain the sources of&lt; high price volatility and to answer the question to what extent it can be&lt; attributed to problems that can be addressed in the long run. Such problems&lt; include flaws in market design that allow some market participants to abuse&lt; market power, limited availability and/or unequal access to transmission,&lt; temporary shortages of generation capacity. Some factors underlying high&lt; volatility of electricity prices may be of permanent nature and may be a&lt; necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and expanded customer&lt; choice.&lt;\n"

The basic premise was to discuss and get feedback from practitioners about the Research Project, and a PhD study which is currently underway at Wharton. The discussions were very interesting - especially as this was my first exposure to this area. Examples of the discussions raised includewhy firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in-housewhat degree of post-acquisition integration was optimaldifficulties of US firms acquiring Euro/Asian high-tech companieshow to value small high-tech firmshow to quantify the success/failure of an acquisitionMy feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to Enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give us first-hand access to the results. Plus it would enable us to learn from the mistakes of others, through meeting practitioners at such workshops and having greater access to the case studies. I guess it could also aid our realignment within the high-tech/communication industry to be seen in such studies.RegardsBen\n"

Please leave your number, if you get my voicemail.To get you started, you might see if you can get access to the FERC GADS database of plant forced and planned availability.   It seems others in Research have asked about this, so you may already have this at your disposal.   The EIA has a good electronic database of plant FOR and POR available for free (http:///www.nerc.com/~esd/).   I know Alexios in RE/EEES has this.   If you wanted to do it the hard way, you can also ask Jaison to access the EPA's CEMS data he has summarized on a machine there in Research.   It contains hourly plant operation for every unit over about 50MW, which you could aggregate up.The WSCC 10-year forecast of new plant construction and loads is a good place to start for plant construction information, but suffers from some notorious \"self-reporting\" error.   It is available in pdf form from the web site http:///www.wscc.com/.   Other sources that should be more near-term, but more accurate are the CEC inventory of plants (http:///www.energy.ca.gov/) and the BPA Whitebook (http:///www.transmission.bpa.gov).As far as basic economic data is concerned, you can either rely on the reported utility forecasts for loads, or you can go to fundamental data.   The ultimate source of the census data collected by the US Dept of Commerce, which you can buy on CDROM for cheap.   It would have this kind of information by SIC code, by ZIP code.   You may also have access to one of the economic forecasting businesses (Wharton's WEFA, DRI, etc.)   They have this in highly digested and complete form.BTW, Tim Heizenrader, who runs Fundamental Analysis and Research on the West Desk, is a sharp cookie and should have all this under control.   Is your client aware of this resource?Give me a buzz and we can talk more,Michael&lt;&lt;&lt; Niclas Egmar/HOU/EEES@ENRON 08/14/000 12:49PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Michael,I'm an analyst in the research group. I would like your help with finding some information specific for the West Coast. A new analyst on the West Power desk needs information on planned outages and planned new generation. He is studying the long-term fundamentals of electricity volatility on the West Coastso so he also needs info on housing starts, computer sales or industrial production figures for computer manufacturing, growth of start-up companies, and population stats.Any help in finding the needed info would be greatly appreciated. Contact me or Daniel Kang (new analyst).Niclas   - TEXT.htm\n"

In addition, If I will be here   in Baton Rouge during the fall, I will need to pay my tuition next month.?   I am able to pursue an internship in large part because of the department's   cooperation and assurance that when I return I will still have a research and or   teaching assistantship to help fund the completion of Ph.D.? I have been   told that such cooperation and assurances are rare at LSU, so I am trying to   rock the boat as little as possible.?I realize until I receive an offer from Enron my internship (I   say internship rather than sabbatical because LSU will not continue to pay me my   stipend while I am away) is not assured until an offer has been extended by   Enron.? I understand that there are procedures?and protocols that must   be followed before this occurs, and I would be willing to do whatever is   necessary to move to the next step in that process.?I will be in Houston on July 8 &amp; 9 for my wife's   grandmother's 80th birthday.? If it would be convenient, I could be in   town?on the preceding Friday, or following Monday for a visit and/or   interview.? If not, given the relatively close proximity between Baton   Rouge and Houston, I would be happy to come at another time.?Thanks again,Shane Green?\n"

Examples of evaluationcriteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,Akaike information criterion.5. Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. Theestimation procedure employed should be briefly described.6. Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.7.

I heard that you moved to Japan, hope everything goes well for you.The catastraphe option was listed in Chicago broad of trade, but the open interest was very small. Internally, Enron insurance group knows a few insurance companies offer such product. The contactperson is Jim Bouillion.If you are interested to offer such bond/insurance in Japan,   we can look into the pricing and \"hedging\" (i.e. reinsurance)issues.   I will discuss this with Vince, Stinson and Vasant. Best Regards,ZiminFrom: Darren Delage@ENRON on 09/111/2000 111:333 AM ZE9To: Zimin Lu/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Japan Catastrophe BondsHello Zimin. I hope all is well with you. As you may have heard,I moved to Enron Japan about 2 weeks ago in order to foster a financial trading presence here, with the intention of utlizing this location to better optimize the management of Gary's exisitng portoflios, as well as to identify and act on local trading or financial opportunities.One peripheral, recurring idea has been for Enron to somehow establish a market in catastraphe bonds and/or insurance. Earthquakes are perhaps the greatest risk that the Japanese people fear according to various polls, a natural response to the significant number of earthquakes that occur in the area . Such a product   would have tremendous and widespread appeal and from a cursary review,   it does not appear that there is a developed,liquid market for such products.I was wondering if you could talk to Vince briefly about his thoughts regarding the feasibility of such a product, in terms of hedging where a   natural offset is not found. Is this a product that research feels a hedge can be made against with a reasonable amount of statisitcal confidence? I realise this is vague and if you need any more information, please contact me.   Sincerely,Darren81-3-5219-4635\n"

And as poor as my timing is, I would like to ask you aquestion/favor.For purposes of this class, do you think it would be possible to obtainsome ofEnron's thoughts on real options?   I was thinking, for example, that afuel-switching analysis would be neat to included in the case packet.   Ofcourse, none of the numbers or names need be real--- only the concepts.

I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall   read the DASH and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the decisionto charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island project (please, see point 2).2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest (Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island transaction. The next stepwill be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related   positions   in one place andto look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is meeting to close a fewremaining gaps   tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island facilityby buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will representsupply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-termcontracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the long-termcontract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal cargosbut that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and coordinatingthe facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension option of5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, wehave no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for such a long tenor. This is   essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread andI would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.One solution would be to   cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the first5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptionsregarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a big prudence reservein case we mark it to market.d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with Brent.VinceJohn Sherriff05/14/2000 01:40 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: LNG May 19 decisionVinceI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.

My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island deal(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail that correlates very well with Brent.VinceJohn Sherriff05/14/2000 01:40 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: LNG May 19 decisionVinceI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.   Anyway with Greg moving to hisnew role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understandthat another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far away).   Anway I understand thisis a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.   Can you please let me know where you stand now?I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in the next couple of days and if youhave anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.Look forward to connecting with you Vince.John\n"

People besides Ben will be modeling in Bryan's group, and C is not a language they know.   One of them is coding in MATLAB, and the IT group is doing Visual Basic.   IT prefers not to support MATLAB, and would also prefer not to support C, because this would make their life easier.   Bryan and Ben need to make a decision as to what is the common platform of choice that is best for them, taking IT in mind.   Ben has said that if the choice is C, he can enforce everybody learn C, and can look into getting some function libraries (if needed).   Similarly, if the choice is VB, he can enforce common use of VB.We need to of course ensure that other members of Research can crosscheck the code.What are your thoughts on C, VB, or MATLAB?

Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of talent we have currentlyin London.Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,   it's timeto nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the mosttechnically qualified member of the group   but also as a natural leader, highlyrespected by his peers and internal customers.   Steve has a very high energy leveland is very efficient as a manager and as   coach of new talent.His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value technicalskills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the same caliberas Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to Houstonfor 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a sufficientincentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has greatly improved.Please, let me know what you think.Vince\n"

I fully concur with all the rankings.It seems things are going well with the Research Group inLondon and this is, to a very large extent, your contribution.I think that Anjam has improved a lot. I don't think, however,that he can run the group in the future. Steve emerged as a naturalleader and has overwhelming support in the organization.VinceDale Surbey06/15/2000 02:28 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: London Research PRCVince,We had the PRC preranking for RAC and Research in London yesterday.   Here's how everyone came out:Steven - Superior:   No controversy here.   Steve received consistently strong feedback (ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories).   The only rough spot was teamwork, arising from the friction between Anjam and himself.Anjam - Excellent:   Anjam received rankings of Superiors or Excellents in all categories.   Several reviewers commented that Anjam's performance in the areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have improved.   I felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on this feedback, even though in terms of leadership I don't rate him high enough to run the group here.Stinsen provided the most insightful comment on Anjam's performance:   \"Technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract from his overall performance\".On a related topic, Anjam has been taking random days off, typically on short notice, so I suspect he's interviewing for a new job.   Given his inability to work with Steven (especially in the future when Stephen heads the group), this may be the best long-term solution.   Any thoughts?   Ben - Superior:   Another non-controversial ranking.   Ben received consistently high marks from all the groups he supports, especially in the area of non-technical skills.I nominated Ben for promotion to Senior Specialist.   Even though he was promoted at year end, he's taken on a lot of responsibility training Kirstee and helping manage the other quant resources in Brian's group.   Also, since Kirstee was hired in at the same level as Ben, a mid-year promotion is appropriate since he's effectively her supervisor.Kirstee - Strong:   Only limited feedback in the 2 months she's been here.   High marks for technical/quantitative, strong in the \"soft\" skills.   I think the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a target for improvement for the rest of the year.- Dale \n"

I'm confused (really confused)... Do you think this means the decision to go ahead/not is going to be made only by Kean, Buy and Koening? AndDo you think this means that we shouldn't meet on Thurs?Personally, I think Enron really needs to meet on Thurs to buckle down and start developing some idea of needs/wants with regard to the outcomes of the Lab. From a practical perspective, if we can't get what we want from this whole thing, Rick's issue of \"where AA is going with this\" is really a mute point, isn't it? So a working meeting might really be worth the effort. Would appreciate your insight and advice.Thanks.Amy   ---"

On the mark-to-market issue, Bob and his colleague Wess told me that as long as payments are tied to one particular plant, we cannot m-t-m them. They had same problem with plants here in the US (like the peaking plants) and they had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to m-t-m the assocated cashflows.   What they did is: they sold power from the plant to an outside party and bought it back from them at completely different (multiple) locations. The buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to maket. Even if Enron can somehow mark-to-market a deal with DPC, it can do so for only 50% of the cashflows because only 50% of DPC is owned by outsiders.   And a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market. Bob was suggesting that if EIPL buys options from DPC and from some other plants and in turn sells power to AP or Karnataka then we could have a case for m-t-m. Politically DPC selling power to EIPL may not be the best solution, to put it rather mildly!Our alternatives, as I see them, are1. Do the deal as we structured it. The only difference is that Enron doesn't mark it to market and income is   earned only in 20002-03.2. Do the deal as we structured it. EIPL/Enron then sells the contract to another party at a profit. The problem, of course, is finding this party and forking part of the profit to them. 3. Same deal, except revenue securitization is done through an outside party in India (not EIPL).Bob said he will think about the issues some more this week. Let me know when you will be here next week so we can meet with Bob together. I will be going to Boston for Tuesday and/or Wednesday (Feb.1-2). I can book an appt. with Bob for us.Sandeep Kohli@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT01/23/2000 09:45 PMTo: Robert Butts, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao@ECTcc: Vince Kaminski, Wade Cline/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ananda Mukerji, Jaiprakash Desai/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Mark-to-MarketBob,I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you about on the phone.   I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction by phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the transaction to you.Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.   I would like you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market.Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the Indian side.   This is a very important transaction for us, and we may need to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account for these maybe well worth it.   Also, what I am concerned about is that there will be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.   It is here that we would like to have mark-to-market accounting.   EIPL is structured through Mauritius, and then Caymen Islands.Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the US there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).   However, in India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income showing till the year 20002 or 20003.   We will need to know how that would get treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the US.   I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of the income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F and other concerns).Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to Indian Corporates).   I need you to think about this too, and see if some type of accounting will solve this issue.   Krishna knows what I am talking about, and will brief you on the same.Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.Look forward to your help and comments.   This is going to be an exciting project for us all.Regards,Sandeep.\n"

I think it's a veryimportant issue and really critical to Enron. The model risk represents avery significant exposure to the company: a wrong model results in baddecisions and eventually leads to accounting errors and incorrect financialstatements.Here are my comments.1. Reasons of model risk. The main source of model risk in Enron is omittedin your list. I think it's due to the fact that the responsibility for thefinal model approval and validation is dispersed in the organization andthere no single unit/person that is vested with the authority to audit,approve   and monitor valuation models. The popular perception is that this isdone by the Research Group, but this could not be further form the truth.Given the way the organization evolved over the last few years, we became agroup of internal consultants, working on highly specialized, partialproblems (sometimes, we work on a project from A to Z, but it's an exceptionto the rule).It's imperative that this is communicated to the senior management in aprecise, non-ambiguous way. I think that this is the main source of potentialproblems and the first shortcoming of the modeling process to be corrected.2. Inappropriate application of models. I would expand point 3 in your draft (inappropriate application of models)and add two lower level points: a) wrong inputs b) incorrect model used for agiven transaction. TVA is an example of point a: a transaction in case ofwhich the inputs have not been being updated for an extended period of timein the past.3. Control Strength. Under Control Strength you can mention that several audits of the Research Group model by Arthur Andersen and Darrell Duffie have beeninitiated at our insistence.4. Audit scope. I don't think you can address the issue of the model risk if you excludefrom your review Risk Analytics and IT. The model developmentactivity cannot be divided into separate, independent processes. I am afraid your recommendations will be highly inaccurate if your audit scope willremain as is.Vince KaminskiAndrew Schuleman@ENRON09/29/999 06:000 PMTo: Wanda Curry/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Model Development ReportAttached is a draft of the Model Development Report that will be presented at the Controller's Meeting on Friday, October 1, 1999.   I would appreciate if you could please review the report and respond with any comments prior to the meeting.   I appreciate all your help and cooperation throughout our review.Thanks,Andy\n"

Even if we develop the model, in most cases we don't control it   and have no   oversight over its uses. A spreadsheet or generic tools we develop can be easily   used and/or   modified by the end user, without our knowledge   and involvement.   2. We typically act as internal consultants and solve narrow, highly complex problems that require   special skills. We   may not provide solutions to the entire problem,   though our involvement may   be interpreted later as our unconditional endorsement of the proposed solution.Vince KaminskiDerek Claybrook@ENRON09/01/999 05:28 PMTo: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Patty Grutzmacher/AAA/Corp/Enron@Enron, Andrew Schuleman/AAA/Corp/Enron@Enron, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Model Development ReviewOver the past few weeks, we have spent time talking to you as well as others involved in model development.

To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.   The questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.   We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.   To make a long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee and announced the upgrade.   I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and will continue to be as the bar gets raised.   I am sure that next year they will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.Thank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.Tedp.s. - there is still lots of interesting opportunities to extend the paradigm\n"

He was wondering if our group could shed some light on major fundamental variables, possibly even for new commodity markets.   I am not sure if we have done much fundamental analysis, since we focus mostly on option valuation.   Also, since market power is an important variable, marginal cost analysis is not sufficient, but if anybody has any info, please let me know.

As you can see his salary is o43,5000 currently and he appears to have a guaranteed bonus of o25,000 for next year.   He would join for &lt;o50,000 from my discussions with Alex Blair, the consultant.   He is very interested in Enron, but is also talking to Morgan Stanley.   I discussed with Vince, who recommended that Sharad should come in at the same level (rank) as Kirstee Hewitt; I would also like to arrange for a direct reporting line to me for Sharad.Regards,Anjam x35383P.S. Kate:   I have attached the agencies terms and conditions below:---",

Date:   April 27 - April 29Location:   Breckenridge, ColoradoAs you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction projectcurrently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this effortwhich requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic optimization andstochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish transfer of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project in the future.We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to haveon the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The effortof network design and construction currently under way is   unprecedented in termsof its scope and complexity and it is important   for technical people, who often havehighly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) andSaturday (April 29). I understand   that you have commitments on Thursday and Friday morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devoteFriday afternoon to more general topics.Vince\n"

The drop in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may change the phase shift across the whole grid. The phase shift across the network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion devices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct.The second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will cause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network. Transformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many miles away from the fault location. Measure the arrival time at several point on the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. Part of the solution is already proven in lightning trackers. The solution may be made more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed (i.e. measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a DSP). This solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure to be pinpointed to a station. The timing base for each of the nodes may be sourced from GPS timing, self locating at the same time !Will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups.Karl.\n"

We still have a few binders withthe presentation materials available if you are interested.We plan to repeat the seminar sometimes in the fall.The first part of the seminar (about 4 hours in the morning) covers general concept of real optionsand their applicability to the energy business.The second, more technical afternoon session, covers stochastic processes usedto model price uncertainty in the energy markets and specific casestudies (valuation of natural gas storage facilities and of peaking gas-fired power plants).The real options approach has been developed specifically to address the problem of makinginvestment decisions under uncertainty. Nobody in this field claims that this is aperfect tool, but it represents a significant progress compared to other techniques developedearlier.Discounted cash flow analysis that tries to incorporate uncertainty throughanalysis of several, in most cases, arbitrary scenarios (most likely, optimistic,pessimistic). These scenarios don't identify explicitly the risk driversand don't specify the future proactive management decisions.The real, option approach is very powerful because it allows to (1) captureuncertainty in an explicit way and   (2) to design investment projects thatallow to exploit future positive developments and reduce future exposures to downside risk.This approach allows also create a link between investment decisions and futureoperational decisions. Forward-looking investment decisions create options that are exercisedin the future through active management of a project.The real options technology relies heavily on advanced statistical tools to comeup with the representation of future possible states of the world. The real challenge isto use these tools in a sensible way. I have seen in my career (almost 30 yearsof applying mathematical tools to business and economic problems) many quants armed with powerful computers who reminded me of monkeys armed with hammers. The challenge is notto run mechanically   thousands of simulations based on arbitrary assumptionsbut to translate in a   creative   way the insights of people who understand specific   businessesinto parsimonious quantitative models. It is especially critical to stress-test the assumptionsof any model and to ask the question if the outcome of a model depends critically on any set of assumptions.If this is the case one should use common sense to examine the underlying assumptions.I remember that in the early eighties quite a few models simulated the dynamics of oil prices,but all the stochastic scenarios represented fluctuations around a very optimistic   upward trend.One would have been better off stepping back and asking a simple question what Economics 101teaches about cartels and the dynamics of supply and demand. \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Erin Rice @ ENRON   06/27/2000 03:52 PM To: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Pre-submitted question on eSpeakGood news!

Would you recommend any texts or articles for a more in-depth study of this area? Is quantification of risk or uncertainty the major challenge in using this concept?

In this =\r=20\rway we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid=\re =20\rrange of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use=\rs=20\ra   consistent modelling framework.? We   believe that for practitioners this=\r=20\rlast point is very important and we continue   to stress in our articles and=\r=20\rpresentations the dangers of having flawed risk   management and giving=20\rarbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using   ad-hoc and inconsiste=\rnt=20\rmodels for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=\r=20\rCONSISTENT   MODELS?).? However, it is not   our wish to concentrate on one=\r=20\rparticular model or models, at the exclusion of   the others because we=20\rbelieve that the choice should rest with the user   (although it will probab=\rly=20\rbe clear from our discussions the model(s) we   prefer).? We therefore try a=\rnd=20\rgive   as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al=\rl=20\rthe   models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=\r=20\rwhich   best suit their needs.\r ?\r In order to meet our objectives the   book is divided into 111 chapters.?   In=\r=20\rchapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to   mode=\rl=20\rand price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the   book=\r.?=20\rIn addition to introducing   the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes=\r=20\rmodelling framework we outline   the numerical techniques of trinomial trees=\r=20\rand Monte Carlo simulation for   derivative pricing, which are used througho=\rut=20\rthe book.\r ?\r In Chapter 2 we discuss the   analysis of spot energy prices.? As   well as=\r=20\ranalysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes   that=\r=20\rcan be used to model the prices.?   We look at the well-know process of=20\rGeometric Brownian Motion as well as   mean reversion, stochastic volatility=\r=20\rand jump processes, discussing each and   showing how they can be simulated=\r=20\rand their parameters estimated.\r ?\r Chapter 3, written by Vince   Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of=20\rEnron Corp., discusses volatility   estimation in energy commodity markets.?=\r =20\rThis chapter builds on the previous one.? It examines in detail the methods=\r, =20\rmerits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different=\r =20\rpricing models introduced in chapter 2.?   Examples from crude, gas, and=20\relectricity markets are used to illustrate   the technical and interpretativ=\re=20\raspects of calculating volatility.\r ?\r Chapter 4 examines forward curves   in the energy markets.? Although   such=\r=20\rcurves are well understood and straight-forward in the most financial =20\rmarkets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel=\rl =20\rdefined curves.? In this chapter we   describe forward price bounds for ener=\rgy=20\rprices and the building of forward   curves from market instruments.? We =20\routline the three main approaches which have been applied to building=20\rforward   curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the econometric=\r=20\rapproach, and   deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti=\rc=20\rfactors.\r ?\r Chapter 5 presents an overview of   structures found in the energy derivativ=\re=20\rmarkets and discusses their uses.? Examples of products analysed in this =\r=20\rchapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as=20\renergy   swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookba=\rck=20\roptions,   and ladder options.\r ?\r Chapter 6 investigates single and   multi-factor models of the energy spot=\r=20\rprice and the pricing of some standard   energy derivatives.? Closed form =\r=20\rsolutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option=20\rprices   both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the=\r=20\rmodels in   this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience=20\ryield and interest   rate model.\r ?\r Chapter 7 shows how the prices of   path dependent and American style option=\rs=20\rcan be evaluated for the models in   Chapter 6.? Simulation schemes are =20\rdeveloped for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a=20\rvariety   of path dependent options.? In order   to price options which=20\rincorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial   tree scheme is=20\rdeveloped.? This tree   is built to be consistent with the observed forward=\r=20\rcurve and can be used to   price exotic as well as standard European and=20\rAmerican style options.\r ?\r Chapter 8 describes a methodology   for valuing energy options based on=20\rmodelling the whole of the market observed   forward curve.? The approach=20\rresults   in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the=\r=20\revolution of a   wide range of energy forward curves.?   The user defined=20\rvolatility structures can be of an extremely general   form.? Closed-form=20\rsolutions are   developed for pricing standard European options, and efficie=\rnt=20\rMonte Carlo   schemes are presented for pricing exotic options.? The chapter=\r=20\rcloses with a discussion of   the valuation of American style options.\r ?\r Chapter 9 focuses on the risk   management of energy derivative positions.? =\r=20\rIn this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions =\r=20\rthat trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the=20\rproblem   of managing the risk through time.?   We begin with delta hedging a=\r=20\rportfolio containing derivatives and look   at extensions to gamma hedging =\r=01)=20\rillustrating the techniques using both spot and   forward curve models.? The=\r=20\rgeneral   model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor=20\rhedging of a   portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.\r ?\r Chapter 10 examines the key risk   management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)=\r=20\rapplied to portfolios containing   energy derivative products.? After =20\rdiscussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs =20\r(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.? We then=\r=20\rcompare the fours major   methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamm=\ra,=20\rhistorical simulation and   Monte-Carlo simulation, applying each to the sam=\re=20\rportfolio of energy   options.? In this chapter we also   look at testing the=\r=20\rVaR estimates for various underlying energy market   variables.\r ?\r Finally, in Chapter 111 we review   modelling approaches to credit risk.?   We=\r=20\rlook in detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P.

Together these provide an=20\rextensive set   of tools with which to measure credit risk.? We present=20\rnumerical examples of   applying these techniques to energy derivatives.\r ?\rBefore   we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this=\r=20\rbook are tools   which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o=\rf=20\rhow both the =01+tool=01,   and the market works.?

We look at the well-know process of   GeometricBrownian Motion as well as? mean reversion, stochastic   volatility and jumpprocesses, discussing each and? showing how they   can be simulated and theirparameters estimated.Chapter 3,   written by Vince? Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of   EnronCorp., discusses volatility? estimation in energy commodity   markets. ? Thischapter builds on the previous one. It examines in   detail the methods,? meritsand pitfalls of the volatility estimation   process assuming different? pricingmodels introduced in chapter 2.   ? Examples from crude, gas, and electricitymarkets are used to   illustrate? the technical and interpretative aspects ofcalculating   volatility.Chapter 4 examines forward curves? in the   energy markets. Although? such curvesare well understood and   straight-forward in the most financial? markets, thedifficulty of   storage in many energy markets leads to less well? defined curves.In   this chapter we? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and   thebuilding of forward? curves from market instruments. We?   outline the three mainapproaches which have been applied to building   forward? curves in energymarkets; the arbitrage approach, the   econometric approach, and? derivinganalytical values by modelling   underlying stochastic factors.Chapter 5 presents an overview   of? structures found in the energy derivativemarkets and discusses   their uses. Examples of products analysed in thischapter include a variety   of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as energyswaptions, compound   options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback options,and ladder   options.Chapter 6 investigates single and? multi-factor   models of the energy spot priceand the pricing of some standard?   energy derivatives. Closed form? solutionsfor forward prices, forward   volatilities, and European option prices? both onthe spot and   forwards are derived and presented for all the models in? thischapter   including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interestrate   model.Chapter 7 shows how the prices of? path dependent   and American style options canbe evaluated for the models in? Chapter   6. Simulation schemes are? developedfor the evaluation of European   style options and applied to a variety? of pathdependent options. In   order? to price options which incorporate early   exerciseopportunities, a trinomial? tree scheme is developed. This   tree? is built to beconsistent with the observed forward curve and   can be used to? price exotic aswell as standard European and American   style options.Chapter 8 describes a methodology? for   valuing energy options based on modellingthe whole of the market   observed? forward curve. The approach results? in amulti-factor   model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of awide range   of energy forward curves. ? The user defined volatility structurescan   be of an extremely general? form. Closed-form solutions are?   developed forpricing standard European options, and efficient Monte   Carlo? schemes arepresented for pricing exotic options. The chapter   closes with a discussion ofthe valuation of American style   options.Chapter 9 focuses on the risk? management of   energy derivative positions. ? Inthis chapter we discuss the   management of price risk for institutions? thattrade options or other   derivatives and who are then faced with the problem? ofmanaging the   risk through time. ? We begin with delta hedging a   portfoliocontaining derivatives and look? at extensions to gamma   hedging ? illustratingthe techniques using both spot and? forward   curve models. The general? modelpresented in Chapter 8 is ideally   suited to multi-factor hedging of a? portfolioof energy derivatives   and this is also discussed.Chapter 10 examines the key   risk? management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)applied to portfolios   containing? energy derivative products. After? discussingthe   concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs?   (volatilities,covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated. We then   compare the foursmajor? methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,   Delta-gamma, historicalsimulation and? Monte-Carlo simulation,   applying each to the same portfolio ofenergy? options. In this   chapter we also? look at testing the VaR estimates forvarious   underlying energy market? variables.Finally, in Chapter   111 we review? modelling approaches to credit risk. ? We lookin   detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morgan   (19997)))and? CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial? Products   (19997))) for which detailedinformation is publicly available. Together   these provide an extensive set? oftools with which to measure credit   risk. We present numerical examples ofapplying these techniques to energy   derivatives.Before? we begin we stress that the models and   methods we present in this bookare tools? which should be used with   the benefit of an understanding of how boththe ?tool??? and the market   works. The? techniques we describe are certainly not?magic wands?   which can be waved at? data and risk management problems toprovide   instant and perfect solutions. To quote from the RiskMetrics   TechnicalDocument ??? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace   experience andprofessional judgement in managing risk.?. ? However,   the right tools, correctlyused make the job a lot?   easier!\n"

Let me know   what your thoughts a=\rre.\r?\rThanks,\rJulie\r(we're getting close)\r?\r?=20\r Preface\r ?\r ?\r ?\r One of our main objectives in   writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk=\r=20\rManagement has been to bring   together as many of the various approaches fo=\rr=20\rthe pricing and risk management   energy derivatives as possible, to discuss=\r=20\rin-depth the models, and to show how   they relate to each other.? In this =\r=20\rway we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid=\re =20\rrange of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use=\rs=20\ra   consistent modelling framework.? We   believe that for practitioners this=\r=20\rlast point is very important and we continue   to stress in our articles and=\r=20\rpresentations the dangers of having flawed risk   management and giving=20\rarbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using   ad-hoc and inconsiste=\rnt=20\rmodels for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=\r=20\rCONSISTENT   MODELS?).? However, it is not   our wish to concentrate on one=\r=20\rparticular model or models, at the exclusion of   the others because we=20\rbelieve that the choice should rest with the user   (although it will probab=\rly=20\rbe clear from our discussions the model(s) we   prefer).? We therefore try a=\rnd=20\rgive   as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al=\rl=20\rthe   models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=\r=20\rwhich   best suit their needs.\r ?\r In order to meet our objectives the   book is divided into 111 chapters.?

I have attached my resume andtranscripts for your perusal.As you can see, my background is not finance.   I becameinterested in finance via trading the markets.   So myresearch interests initially revolved around the centralconcept of trading...pricing, technical type thinking,insider transactions, volume, and such.   But with exposure,my interests have grown and I have discovered that I reallyenjoy economics.   Also there are many issues in financethat sound interesting as I am exposed to them.   The pointis, I am too early in my career to set strict limits on myinterests.My goals are to get introduced to research and to newideas, to associate with good people, and to work onstrengthening my weaknesses.   I am interested in startingto build a network within the field of finance andespecially quantitative finance.   Ultimately, I have toprepare myself for independent research in order to succeedin my field.This brings me to my final point.   Publications areimportant for me.   Thus I would want to work on topics thatEnron would be willing to publish.   I would be willing towork on proprietary models, as long as there was a portionof the research that could be written up for publicationwithout jeapordizing the proprietary aspects of the model.Just to let you know.   I was not in Dr. Kao's energy class. I took his stochastic processes class.   Dr. Kao justmentioned your talk to me as he thought I might beinterested in meeting you and learning more about what isbeing done at Enron.Thanks again.

So, I'd like to put the details below in writing and send out to him   for Tuesday delivery.   I'm playing phone tag with him regarding the other details and will follow up with him again in the morning. ThanksToni   \tFrom:   Grant Masson @ ECT   09/15/2000 111:24 AM To: Toni Graham/Corp/Enron@Enroncc: Norma Villarreal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Rabi DEToni:We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a minimum of $15k cash.   That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.   Vince said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.   He will ponder the offer; probably for a few more days and get back with us.   He may well call you to discuss the exact details of the benefits.   ESOP, 401(k) contributions, etc.Regards,Grant.\n"

Please review and have your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a different Enron subsidiary on October 13.   If at all possible, could we try to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I left off?I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion.   Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern regarding providing a response time of 2 business days.   I do not have any answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond on this issue.   I look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within the next 2 weeks if possible.Thank you,Karla FeldmanEnron Corp.(713) 646-75554\n"

I would also be delightedto be your host for dinner on Thursday night if that is convenient for you. I'll be back in my office on Monday, and will look forward tohearing from you. JimJames S.

I work in the London office of IIR and am puttingon a similar conference.   Your company has been mentioned by a wide variety ofpeople who I have spoken with about real options.   A number of people havementioned that your company is regarded very much as a market leader.I would like to discover if a representative from ENRON might be interested inspeaking at the conference.   I have attached the draft programme with agreedspeakers to date.   The conference is by no means set in stone and if a speakerfrom ENRON decided to become involved I would ensure that you were given a goodspeaking slot in the conference and would have editorial control over the talk.I very much hope that ENRON will become involved with the conference and I lookforward to speaking with you today or next week about the prospect.Kind regardsJulia ShawConference ProducerTel 444 171 915 5650Fax 444 171 915 50001Email:jshaw@iirltd.co.uk   !!!   !!!   !!! - Smith.doc\n"

I find this area of study fascinating and would very much like to learn more.   It's interesting that you mentioned the Amram/Kulatilaka book because I'm reading it right now!   I've talked with my director, Terry Galassini about the possibility of taking your classes this fall and it looks good so far.   And I'd like to take you up on your offer of a set of binders on real options and energy industry applications. FYI, I'm a senior engineer in a facility planning group up here in Omaha although I obtained an MBA from the University of Houston a few years back.   The concepts of risk/reward and all of the financial tools available to hedge risk in financial markets have always tantalized me in their possible parallels in the gas industry.   My recent personal discovery of this area of real option valuation has further piqued my interest.   If you could, please add my name as a possible attendee to your fall presentations.   Thanks again for your e-Speak dialogue.Bryan Reinecke(402) 398-76222\n"

Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VARand portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for yourbusiness.   I would be happy to talk with you further about ourrogram( http:///student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interestin Enron (the name comes up a lot!).   Also, if you are interested, we run a\"Speaker Series\"   on most Friday's during the fall and spring that wouldgive you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our studentsin an area of interest.   Such a meeting would, I think, help you betterunderstand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as giveour students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?Thank you for your time.RickRichard L.

Given the critical needto reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets, we believethat our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their directmarketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond towhatever the offer is---improving the efficiency of mailings and otherpromotional campaigns (so there is an efficiency angle, see!)Because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based onactual purchases, our results tend to be significantly more predictive thandemographic-based models. So far, the the response from utilities and \"newentrants\" I've been talking to so far has been quite positive, and we havesome tests of our data underway, but we're interested in talking to as manyplayers in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meetutility needs.I can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested, butI guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile toarrange a short meeting sometime on the 25th of April with whoever at Enronmight have interest in hearing what we're up to, and (most importantly)listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets.Thanks very much for any help . . .

Given the critical needto reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets, we believethat our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their directmarketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond towhatever the offer is---improving the efficiency of mailings and otherpromotional campaigns (so there is an efficiency angle, see!)Because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based onactual purchases, our results tend to be significantly more predictive thandemographic-based models. So far, the the response from utilities and \"newentrants\" I've been talking to so far has been quite positive, and we havesome tests of our data underway, but we're interested in talking to as manyplayers in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meetutility needs.I can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested, butI guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile toarrange a short meeting sometime on the 25th of April with whoever at Enronmight have interest in hearing what we're up to, and (most importantly)listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets.Thanks very much for any help . . . I look forward to catching up andhearing how things are going for you.Regards,Brad Davids303-410-55531---Original Message---From: Steven.R.Meyers@enron.com [mailto:Steven.R.Meyers@enron.com]Sent: Monday, April 10, 2000 12:13 PMTo: Brad.Davids@abacus-direct.comSubject: Re: Possible Meeting?It'd be great to meet on the 25th in the afternoon.   I have a flight in theevening.   I'm interested in hearing about life at abacus.   I too have heardthat Enron is getting back into the residential market.   What type ofdatabase do you have?

Brad is now working at Abacus who works with residential customer patterns as well as predictive modelling.   He's going to be here the 25 and 26 of this month.

He wants me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and I'll look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.   My own efforts to date have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I obviously don't have the high-level view you have.   This will ensure I get the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely:1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation;2. Gas storage;3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.   I haven't used AMC myself up till now, I've been carrying out static optimizations, with different price curve scenarios being run through.I'm still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach - people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and they're still being supplied with useful products, as per my \"Real Options Strategy\" document.Cheers,Steve\n"

My research group isestablishing a long term collaboration with Dr. Kaminski and Dr. Gibner, and Ihope to help foster this relationship this summer.I would just like to discuss one issue that is very specific to my status ofinternational student. As an international student, I am required to enroll parttime at Stanford University during the summer quarter in order to be consideredeligible for a summer internship (\"optional practical training\"). The cost ofthe part-time tuition will be approx. $23000 for this academic year. The pastsummer, my employer (AT&amp;T) matched this tuition cost in an effort not todiscriminate between international and domestic Ph.D. students. The offers forsummer employment I received this year have also been very flexible in thisrespect. I would like to know if Enron could do the same; it would be of coursevery much appreciated (given the notoriously precarious financial condition ofPh.D. students). Yet, to make things clear, please rest assured that myacceptance of your offer is not conditioned on your reply regarding this issue,and that I intend to be at Enron this summer.All the best,   Giuseppe---:::Giuseppe A Paleologo:::   http:///www.stanford.edu/~gappy\n"

When you invoke Exceed (or LIM Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install itself the first time, and will then \"disappear\" to the Taskbar. you need to *right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose \"Tools\" and \"Client Startup\" and then \"New.\"You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow emulation. You need to specify the Host Type as Sun, enter your User Name and Password, set the Host Name to: capers.ect.enron.comand then, on the Command Line, type the following (carefully):/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -display @DThen, use the file menu to Save this as capers.xs and then click on the Run! menu. within a second or two, a window will open up with you logged into the serve capers. You are now on a Unix server, and the directory is your home directory. From here, if you simply type \"sas\" the 3 windows for an interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop. You are in business.5) you also need to install your ftp. follow the procedures with the software, and then create a new session called \"enron\" where you choose as the server simply \"earth\" (do not add any further descriptors such as .enron.com). supply your user name and *unix* password, check the \"remember password\" box, and the default communication setups should be correct (eg, host type as \"automatic detect\").when you invoke ftp and connect to enron, it will put you in your home directory on the Unix system, the same directory your xwindow comes up in under Exceed.if you have any problems, i'll be happy to helpClaytonPS i have a complete set of new SAS manuals i am happy to loan out if you'll just write your name down when you take them.\n"

Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon $15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner)in revenue.   By re-selling this data to market analysts or by internally using this data for forecasting future oil/gas production Enron could increase the accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally.   By holding the data as exclusive (or partially exclusive), Enron would have a significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas.(Vince's team is quantifying the valuation of this information)Attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data transfer via satellite, by a geophysicist at SpaceData - William K. Aylor, calculated using $222/barrel oil.Based upon your availability, Jon Adler and I would like to make a presentation to you (or your designated representative) on the Enron potential of this opportunity, sometime next week (17-20 October). - SDT Business Case4.pdfV.R.,Richard ReichardtEnron Broadband Services(713)-345-83777 (Office)(713)-907-3767 (Mobile)14000 Smith Street, Suite EB 4364 Houston, Texas   7770002\n"

He relayed some additional requirements which need to be added to the agreement, which include the following: 1. The price agreed upon is $90,000. 2. D-G will provide system support.3. No later than 12 months of execution of the agreement, D-G will provide the source code to Enron.   In the meantime, the source code is to be in escrow.   Additionally, the source code would be released sooner than the 12 months if any of the following conditions occur:   (i) D-G goes out of business; (ii) D-G is unable to provide effective technical support; or (ii) if D-G agrees to release it sooner.Before I have our attorney add these things to the agreement, we need to discuss the escrow situation.   Vince mentioned that you had suggested that your attorney keep the software in escrow.   Is your attorney a U.S. attorney?   It seems like I may have recalled that way back in March you might have said you had a friend or relative that was an attorney.   Is that the same person?   Does this attorney work for a large firm, small firm, or solo practitioner?   Basically, if you could just provides some additional information about your attorney, I would appreciate it.We normally would use an Escrow company to put the software in escrow.   We have dealt with a company here in the U.S. called DSI Technology.   I will check into that pending your answer regarding your attorney.Once we decide what we want to do regarding placing the software in escrow, we will red-line the agreement to reflect such changes and e-mail it back to you for your review.I look forward to hearing from you.Karla FeldmanEnron Corp.Contract Administration(713) 646-75554\n"

Then, by going back and incorporating obvious dates from the calendars for 19997-1999, the following regression analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:giving this Sunday = $44403+ a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since Jan. 5, 19997)+ no pure effect from last week's contributions (i.e., denies first-order autoregressive effects)+ $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas+ $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,19998 or April 25,1999- $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday- $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving- $73   if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3 years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for 2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.Clayton\n"

I'm not sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token salary increase.2)   Offer him more responsibility:   What are your thoughts on timing for making Steve the official head of the London research team?   With my move to EBS, should we accelerate this?   I think this is good way to keep him happy and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater responsibility.3)   We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) contract with a 12-month notice clause.   Obviously anyone signing one of these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.

My phone number is (617) 492-95551.   I graduated from Princeton University in 19996 (mathematics), and came straight to MIT for aPh.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.   In my firstthree years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses inpsychology (at MIT and Harvard).   I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.   Inparticular, I am interested in the interaction between customers andcompanies (hence the interest in psychology).   The (tentative) title of myPhD thesis is \"Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet\", and I amsending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that willgive you an idea of what this research is about.Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your researchgroup next week.PauloPricing Substitute Products on the InternetObjective:To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services soldonthe internet.Motivation:This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimizationmodels are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.   The technologicalinnovations associated with the internet brought about an overload ofinformationwhich inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.Furthermore,companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers canhave access to.The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issuefacedby internet companies.   Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.VCRsor computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.   Companies can showdifferent products and different prices to each consumer.   This type offlexibilitywas not available until the internet came about.The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.   Themethodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number ofother settings, such as pricing services.   Services are unique, and there aremany cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by agiven company.   Our model will help companies decide which services to offerto which customers and how much to charge for these services.Research Strategy:Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two componentswhich can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.   Thesecomponents are choice models and optimization models.Choice Models:Choice models describe how customers make choices.   The management literaturedraws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.   Thecommon approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristicelimination methods.   These methods consist of the elimination of optionsbased on the sequential elimination of features until only one choiceremains.These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves veryeasily to mathematical analysis.   Economists focus on utility-maximing modelsthat are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychologicalmodels.The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.   The problem withthese types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of howconsumer make choices on the internet.   The first step in our research willbeto develop choice models that capture the interactions going on betweencustomersand companies on the internet.Optimization:Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over acertain planning horizon.   On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenuestill exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.   Short termprofit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you knowyour customers and are able to retain them.   The optimization problem musttherefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component(learning).\n"

I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.   I suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved experience with ePowered content can be quantified.   This may include performing control experiments at M.I.T.   We decided not to over specify what he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.   I suggested once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the internship.   Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and this is a great way to start.I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start around May 222, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.Regards,Ravi.P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 222, 2000 start group.   Paulo will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that may be too low, etc.   ---"

The deadline for submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so there's less of a hurry.As regard our summer visits, we'll need to speak to Dale over the budget.   Personal commitments mean it's difficult for me to take two whole months to visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter visit.   I'd obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the only way I can do it.   I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.I've persuaded Richard to pay for Matt's visit in its entirety, and I've no doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.   It's difficult to think who'd be the natural group to pay for me.   I honestly think I'll have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that it's worth his while to pay for my visit.   I get the impression he thinks I'm doing OK without the need to go to Houston for further training.I'm interviewing a candidate for Bjorn's model review role during today's videoconference, so we'll need to speak beforehand or perhaps Friday.All the best,SteveVince J Kaminski05/10/2000 01:54 PMTo: Steven Leppard/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Grant Masson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pinnamaneni Krishnarao/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: ConferenceSteve,I am tied up at the Power2000 conference.I shall get back to you with my comments on Thursday morning.I also want to talk to you tomorrow about finalizing the dates of the summerrotations.

We cannot get our San Antonio hotel on the first weekend in April (as last year).   However, we can get the hotel and make all our \"fun\" arrangements for the second weekend in April.   However, this is Easter weekend.   The good news is that the room rates are substantially lower because it's a holiday.   However, we are concerned that holding the meeting on this particular Friday-Saturday will interfere with family plans such that some or many of you may not be able to attend.   My related question to you is this:Does holding the meeting on the second weekend in April (Easter weekend) pose a problem for you?   Please give us your thoughts ASAP even if you think you may not be able to attend this year's conference.   We need your opinion to guide our decision.Thanks and I hope to see you all again next April (sometime)!John p.s.   We are very fortunate to have Enron return as our corporate sponsor again this year.   John D. MartinCarr P.

I know that your tried to help me and sent to   Brad McSherry the justification for me to carry over 10 days.I bothered you a few times in November and December 1999 and since your response was optimisticI did not take any of those 10 days in 1999. But I never heard from HR.Now I am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake. I would like to take 5 of them in March ( from 3/13/000 to 3/17/000).What is your advice? Should I contact Brad McSherry? Even negative response from HR in November orDecember last year would be better than loosing vacation days.I really appreciate your help,Tanya.Tanya Tamarchenko12/02/999 12:51 PMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Tanya vacation   Hi, Vince,sorry to bother again with my question.I first e-mailed my question a month ago (on Nov. 3).Since we still have not heard from HR, is it fair to assume that I can carry over my 10   vacation days to the next year? If not - I have to take 5 days before Dec. 17, because then I go on vacations anyhow. I would really prefer not to take offmost of December, there are quite a lot of things going on.Thank you for your help in resolving this question.Tanya.\n"

(since we won't have an issue this coming Monday).   I'd like to get a little earlier start and see if we can get one or two pieces by then.   What do you think?By the way, I have Gwyn Koepke lined up as the \"personality of the week\" so we're okay there.Best Regards,Sam\n"

Normally I would want to split this into two parts, but the way it's structured (several references to the charts at the end), this does not look immediately practical.   We would certainly need Maureen's input on this.   Without any further changes, I would want to publish the whole thing together.2.   I assume that Maureen will send the changes back to you, and that you will send me the final version for publication.   Am I correct?I'll do everything else and hold release until Technical Corner is ready.SamVince J Kaminski@ECT09/18/2000 07:555 AMTo: Maureen Raymond/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: wsmith2@enron.com Subject: Technical cornerMaureen,The article for Technical Corner requires some editorial work.Please, make sure you make the changes ASAP.My comments are in magenta.

I learned a lotabout the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with thequality of the people at the Sydney office.1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can helpyou with a phone interview.2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I amvery interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him overto the States   where we lack desperately technical talent.Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? The main determination I need from you is whether he canfunction in a company like Enron. As any good academiche sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in caseyou don't have a PostScript reader on your system.3. Christian Werner does some really neat things onthe weather front. I would like to determine if he can helpus to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houstonfor a week to discuss the weather forecasting   technology with   Mike Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic? I think that he could learn a lotfrom Mike and other weather guys here how we translate weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad tounderwrite the cost of this trip.Vince\n"

Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was \"too old and too experienced\".   Since I felt that Thomas has some merit, I asked Houston to have an informal chat with Thomas.   Houston wish to pursue the interview process further, and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews.   I'm somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this, since it seems he's trying to put up barriers to these interviews.I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he recounts some strange conversations with Anjam.   He says he received a call from Anjam on Thursday (13th April) evening (outside office hours), asking how he got his CV into Enron (I'd shown Anjam the email and CV back in early February), and how Anjam could contact him (despite the fact he was contacting him at that moment).Anjam then called Thomas on his work number (bad form) on Friday 14th asking Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday (one working day's notice).   Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week, and that he'd have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things at work.   He said he'd contact Anjam on Monday (today) to confirm his availability.Today (17th April) Thomas called Anjam to say he couldn't make it, and that he wouldn't be able to make it for two weeks (not so serious, he thought, given that we're losing time to Easter anyway).   Anjam told Thomas that the position might be filled in two weeks' time.Thomas is concerned about missing the boat, and I for one didn't even realise it was leaving so soon!Can anyone shed any light on this?Steve\n"

He's extremely interested in moving to Enron, and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research, although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.   He remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but wants to look at new markets and products.   I think we should seriously consider hiring him.   He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston, but there's no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives pricing (and thinking) here in London.Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?   I'm meeting with him again on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by Lane at King's College.   I've attached his CV for your reference.All the best,Steve\n"

He expressed that the Wessex people had originated the data and that the graph was correct, to the best of their knowledge.   The only (but very important correction) is that they started the graph at an index of 1000%, which does not imply a 1000% of RAB multiple.   Rather, the initial RAB multiple was around 80%, implying that the entire line should be taken down by 20 percentile points.   Thus the all time hime in late 98 should be closer to the 1.3x RAB that I had targeted during our discussion.   Please call Keith if he has not yet contact you.\n"

The delta is 352999$/mt for Dec 2000. The Cu VaR has gone up from $2,245,000 to $3,306,000. I estimated that the portfolio for the 1st would increase to approx $3,039,000 so this seems sensible. The overall VaR change is from $4,780,796 to $5,9991,569. Again, the estimate for the 1st Aug was for an increase in VaR to ~ $5,476,000.All estimates were based on a delta of 32,0004/dmt.There has also been some increase in the VaR for Aluminium which will effect the overall total.A summary is as follows : regards,Kirstee\n"

Top students are highly sought&lt; &lt; &lt; after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this&lt; &lt; &lt; competition.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the&lt; &lt; &lt; project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the&lt; &lt; &lt; end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can&lt; &lt; &lt; happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.&lt; &lt; &lt; I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets&lt; &lt; &lt; going.

We can put issues online the old way until they set you up with the new stuff.

I have a couple of suggestions for your future efforts:Get Adobe Acrobat 4.0, Full Version (not just the Reader)---this will allow you to publish it in final form from your desk.Do you have access to the Y: drive?   It's a drive mapped off of O:\\Research and all of the web pages are there.   Let me know, and if you don't, as long as you have rights to O:\\Research, I can come down and map if for you.Then, all you have to do is print the new edition to PDF, then save it to the same spot each time, and it's automatically online.Sam\n"

      "body": "\nJoe,I have written to Pal Quilkey to invite Christian Werner to Houstonfor a week to discuss how much of his research we can use.VinceJoseph Hrgovcic08/01/2000 06:51 PMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike A Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Vince, I have inquired into Christian's climate models. It seems to me like a long term project. Chiristian says that his model might be able to do better than the Australian Met given that they ignore some of the variables he uses and that they are an \"old boy's network\"   resistant to new developments, but I don't think the same can be said of most other weather services. As far as the NWS goes, they run their model on a Cray, they have several very talented PhD's working on it full-time,   and even then, they can only get a dozen or so runs per night. In other words, it's a huge system. Replicating something even close to that will not be an easy task.   That being said, I think there are related applications that we could look into.   Since I've already promised the RAC group and the weather desk's PJM traders to put together a Vector AutoRegressive model of daily temperatures, I think it makes sense to see if something better than a VAR model can be put together, perhaps a very stripped down version of the kind of model Christian has. What I have in mind is something   that would give us say, up to several dozens of \"possible\" temperature forecasts every morning, which would be calculated using actual climate models (as opposed to time series models). I would not use this as a forecasting tool (the NWS model results would make a far better   \"best guess\"), but our ensemble could still be used to provide a distribution of temperature scenarios. This ensemble would have several uses: 1) we could price the book for the ensemble of runs and thereby obtain a more realistic daily V@R for the Weather Book (and eventually interface that with the power desk's V@R calculations) 2) we could use the ensemble of forecasts to relate temperature forecasts to week-ahead CDD and HDD distributions (for use in our demand swaps) 3)   if Freese-Notis were to give us one of their qualitative forecasts, e.g., \"expect the trough to recede\" we could sort through the different Monte Carlo scenarions, find one in which the trough in question is receding, and use corresponding output statistics to download the actual temperatures corresponding to that scenario. Up till now, we haven't found a good way of getting a numerical fix on what different forecasts actually mean temperature-wise 4) we could use the associated visualization routines that come with such models to get animations of the evolution of historical weather patterns. The traders could use these in order to look for historical periods which roughly match current weather conditions and get an idea of what could happen; although these meteorological models would not be good for simulating month-ahead or season-ahead weather (trust me on this) we could still use the visualization technology to do to analogous seasonal animations. Just today, I've spoken with Dr. Jacobsen of Stanford University, who has written one of the more recent textbooks on climate forecasting , and who worked with UCLA's general circulation model.   He says that getting a simplified version of MM5 (which is itself a simplified, limited-area version of the GCM models that NWS, COLA, and UCLA use) would take several months to implement,   assuming the people involved are already well versed in the technology. Also, I have contacted AER, a Massachusetts- based weather consulting firm, and they tell me that they have a MM5 model running daily (only one run per night), and also some smaller PC models up and running. They are of course willing to work with us for a fee. Their MM5 version runs on a $2000,000 parallel processor. I am open to your suggestions (or objections as the case may be). I'm not sure how the costs would be apportioned given that this would benefit all of Enron, and not just the weather desk. I am scheduled to go to Boston next week anyway, and would like to use the opportunity to visit with AER. I will of course coordinate any projects with Christian (if we get something like this up and running it will be more likely that he can get the computing power he needs to run his own Australian model).Joe\n"

In part?because of your visit,?and my?primary interest in   normative research, my?plans have changed.? While I?still want to   earn my Ph.D.,?I plan to pursue a career in research in the private   sector.?As you know, Ph.D. programs in financial economics are   designed to train future academics.? Not surprisingly, they emphasize   methods to approach the types of questions that are of interest to finance   academics.? What did surprise me, however, was that these areas of interest   often had little to do with what I imagined to be the concerns of practitioners   in the real world.? As you mentioned in your discussion, academic   researchers know little about what their counterparts in the private sector   are?doing.???   ?In light of my objective, I feel I would get the most out of   the remainder of my doctoral studies if I took some time off to work in the   private sector to see first hand the?types of challenges I can expect to   face as a researcher in corporate America.? As my primary interests revolve   around the use of derivatives and financial engineering in corporate risk   management, Enron, as the leading innovator in these areas, would be an ideal   place to learn.? I was wondering if you were aware of any openings at the   company that might provide me with the exposure I am looking for.? If there   are no such positions or opportunities, any advice or suggestions you could give   me,?such as whether or not you think such a \"sabbatical\" (for lack of a   better term) would be helpful, or information on private sector careers for   Ph.D.'s would be greatly appreciated.? ?I am sending a current copy of my vita as an attachment.?

Skilling\" &lt;sreinar@enron.com&lt;cc: Vince J Kaminski &lt;vkamins@ect.enron.com&lt;, \"Robert A. Jarrow\" &lt;raj15@cornell.edu&lt;, \"Robert C. Merton\" &lt;rmerton@hbs.edu&lt; Subject: Mr. Jeffrey K. SkillingPresident and C.O.O.,Enron Corp.Dear Jeff,This email is from Robert Jarrow (Cornell) and myself (Joe Cherian). I hopeyou recall meeting/lunching with Bob Jarrow &amp; me when you keynoted at my1999 Math Finance Day conference here at Boston University. I wanted tointroduce you to SKG Inc., a startup that is focused on providing aninnovative service to the electronic trading community. Messers KuppuswamySeshadhri, Sriketan Mahanti, and Gaurav Mallik are the principal foundersof SKG, Inc. Bob Jarrow and I represent the company's Scientific AdvisoryBoard. Nobel laureate Robert Merton, who also sat on our table during yourkeynote address, very kindly serves as an ad hoc Senior Advisor to SKG andhas been an invaluable resource to SKG, including putting us in touch withJP Morgan. Coincidentally, the C.O.O. of JP Morgan Capital Corp. EdColloton, in an April 7 meeting told us he would introduce us to the C.F.O.of Enron Online, whom he knows and at which he felt SKG would have hugevalue-adding opportunities. However, given Ed's busy travel schedule, Idon't believe he has been able to do that yet. Hence this joint decision byBob Jarrow and myself to send you this email.SKG's solution is to provide dynamic pricing and value maximization inelectronic trading of securities/commodities on ECNs and ATSs (AlternativeTrading Systems). It achieves this through a process of \"strategicnegotiation\" using automated agents (intelligent software manifestations).Our system should not be viewed as an ECN, but rather as an enhancement toany extant trading system, be it an ECN, ATS, CLOB, NASDAQ, etc. Ourinitial system design has been conducted for financial instruments trading,e.g. bonds/equities, but our strategy is as much applicable to energy/powerinstruments trading, high speed communications bandwidth trading, and otherweb-based commodities trading, which we believe is of interest to EnronOnline.SKG is superior to existing solutions in the following way:1)   It considers multiple attributes, e.g., price, time, volatility,bandwidth. (In high speed communication bandwidth scenarios, for example,the dimensions could be price, bandwidth size, time for which bandwidthavailable, continguity of the allocation, and such.)2) It involves dynamic matching as opposed to \"static\" matching.3) It is multi-lateral.4)   It adapts itself dynamically to changing market conditions.5) It allows traders to make important trade-offs, as they do intraditional markets.Currently, SKG is involved in discussions with the Heads of Trading atFidelity, Putnam Investments, Lehman Bros., KPMG, Meridien Research,Salomon Smith Barney, JP Morgan, State Street, Banc of America, McKinsey,Citizens Power, and a host of other folks.We think we have a value-adding service to provide to Enron Online or anyother Enron subsidiary that the SKG offering matches and that you deem fit.SKG's founders and I will be very happy to provide you or yourrepresentative(s) with more details, including a demo of the prototype, ina meeting. We are therefore hopeful that you will be able to arrangesomething appropriate.Thanks very much, Jeff! We look forward to hearing from you.With warm regards,Joseph Cherian and Robert JarrowCc: Professor Robert C. MertonJoseph A.

The numbers in the column \"VAR85\" are very close to 15%. This is the argument in favor of using historical vols. And also the results do not depend on the decay factor in this experiment.Also notice: the numbers in column \"VAR95\" are higher than 5% and this is an indication of fat tails.Let me know if you have any questions.Tanya.\n"

The problem is the volatility found in theregressions is&lt; on the order of several hundred percent, and so when I plot the historicaldata&lt; next to a simulated curve over the course of the year, the simulated curvetends&lt; to drift up or down stupidly both in the Jump diffusion and Garch+Jumpdiffusion&lt; model.   Any suggestions would be accepted with pleasure. I wonder if Ishould&lt; skip the figure.   It seems a pity to do so however, because otherwise thelast&lt; section comes off as a bit of an afterthought, and I would like to presenta&lt; practical example.   Again any guidance would be appreciated.&lt;&lt; Anyway, I am sending you a somewhat improved draft now (minus only thelast&lt; figure), rather than sit on the whole thing while I stew on this bit,   Ihope&lt; this will be useful to you.

The response was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.   Your fellow employees asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.   In all, we received requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.   We thought you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've provided a sampling of the suggestions below.   Here are the top ten most requested eSpeakers.10.   Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 9.   Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 8.   Satisfied Enron Customers7.   Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People6.   Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host5.   General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 4.   Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.3.   Former U.S. President George Bush 2.   Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 1.   Texas Governor George W. BushWhile we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least some of these special guests.   If you have any contacts who could help us get in touch with these guest speakers, please let us know at ethink@enron.com.   Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.   Those requests should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our colleagues can be quite a task!Thank you all for your participation.\n"

I am wondering whether research is looking into the application of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min, etc. I am in particular referring to the news article below:http:///213.219.222.254/i-wex/resources/ef2906000.htmIn the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in thepast has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could provide a meaningful tool for the analysis. Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich) is indicating the application of EVT to V@R...Thank you! Regards,Christian \n"

A Coastal official declined to comment on the company's forward positions. Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. \"More than 90 percent\" of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for $2.40, he said. Hedging in the current market plays to the company's primary aim of meeting investors' expectations, Connery said. \"Our first goal is to deliver the earnings goal that we set out, and that dictates that we hedge out commodity volatility,\" he said. ...$2.40???

There are a couple of things to keep in mind: -Enron IT supports Enron equipment. -All equipment must be purchased through \"Enron IT Purchasing\"Our current high end desktop is a 8000 MHZ pentium II machine with 128M of RAM.   You can bump up the RAM to whatever you feel is appropriate. When the 1GHz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our standard.What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.   The \"image\" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when it is deployed.   If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image for, we can't support it for a multitude of reasons.

Nevertheless, I am writing to seeif you can squeeze some time to finish the recommendation form anytime soon. It will be a big help.Thank you very much, Vince.Have a good day.Sincerely, Li x39635\n"

As an example, severe cold weather specific to the Midwest can result in an elevation of spot market prices at Henry Hub, where prices elsewhere in the Northeast are such that the basis appears to be less than the commodity charge to ship gas from Louisiana to the Northeast. This can happen when gas is not being moved in the spot market from Louisiana to the Northeast at that time.   The notion of \"equilibrium\" cannot, in my view, always assume \"spot\" gas is flowing along all nodes of the network.Clayton\n"

He is also currently employed at Air Liquide USA (or one of its subsidiaries) over in the Galleria area.   As a consequence of Air Liquide's pending merger with BOC, Steve believes that there will be significant personnel reductions sometime during 2000 and is taking action now to try to locate his next professional challenge.Lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and I would be grateful if you could have a look and let me know whether you might be interested.   Alternatively, if you don't see a fit (or are adequately staffed at the moment), I would be grateful for any suggestions you might have as to whom I might contact internally on Steve's behalf.Many thanks in advance.M.L.

I understand this tax effect already when you explained it to me in your office this morning.I agree with you that short-selling is not so good, especially for me, because I have a significant capital loss this year. I definitely don't want to increase my capital loss carry over.(The short-selling idea might work for a person who wants to exercise his options and already has a huge capital gain this year. Unfortunately, it is not me.)Thanks again for pointing this out.The \"employee stock option with taxes\" problem sounds interesting.

The price goes to $1000.   You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxeson your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is28% x $30,000 = $8,4000. You can use only $3,000 of your loss againstordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option positionas an offset.The remaining part of your capital loss   is carried forward and you get thetax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have income in thefuture (or capital gains).Not so good.By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock optionsis a very interesting and difficult problem.VinceChonawee Supatgiat@ENRON07/10/2000 111:40 AMTo: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: short-sell vs exerciseBelow is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)-chonaweeShort-selling is better than exercising your employee stock optionsIn general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise.However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime. Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as followIf you exercise 1000 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, you would earn   (70-45)*1000 = $2,5000. But if you short sell 1000 ENE at 70, no matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn (70-45)*1000 = $2,5000. The advantage of short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can cover your short position, get (70-60)*1000 = $1,000, and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,5000. That is, you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position.\n"

Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option positionas an offset.The remaining part of your capital loss   is carried forward and you get thetax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have income in thefuture (or capital gains).Not so good.By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock optionsis a very interesting and difficult problem.VinceChonawee Supatgiat@ENRON07/10/2000 111:40 AMTo: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: short-sell vs exerciseBelow is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)-chonaweeShort-selling is better than exercising your employee stock optionsIn general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your exercise.However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the options to cover your short position anytime. Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as followIf you exercise 1000 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, you would earn   (70-45)*1000 = $2,5000. But if you short sell 1000 ENE at 70, no matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover the short position and still earn (70-45)*1000 = $2,5000. The advantage of short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can cover your short position, get (70-60)*1000 = $1,000, and still keep your options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,5000. That is, you still keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your short position.\n"

      "body": "\nClayton,We can discuss your request   when I come back to the office on Monday.Regarding the trip to Portland. Such a trip requires an   explicit prior permission from your boss,myself in his absence, or Stinson in my and Vasant's absence.In case you did not ask for such a permission before, the request   is denied.Vince\tClayton Vernon @ ENRON\t07/20/2000 03:12 PM To: Vasant Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: statusVasant-I hope you had a wonderful vacation back home, and are rested and recovered from the long flight back.I wanted to give you an update of the EOL project, the Gas Model, and of my intentions here at Enron.Software (in compiled C on the Unix platform) has been developed and debugged to listen to the EOL trades, process them, book them, and file them away. In addition, software has been developed and debugged to mark these to market on a continual basis, and to store the entirety of open positions on EOL in a dynamic matrix facilitating analysis. IT has yet to get back with me on how the software can be informed of those trades ultimately rejected for credit purposes.These data files are stored in a format for reading by Excel or by SAS, for which I have written the data step program and basic tabulation routines elucidating the structure of the data.I am in the process of documenting all of this for you.With regards the Gas Model and its slow performance on the Compaq, Dell has agreed to loan me one of their competing machines to the Compaq, to see if the performance issue of the LP is related to the Compaq. I have been researching this issue with IT here and with Compaq and Dell. The new machine will be here any day now (no financial obligation to anyone), and I will be able to immediately ascertain whether the problem the model is having is Compaq-specific.I am also in the process of documenting the Gas Model for you.I've tried to do my best for you, Vasant, but I have been frustrated by not only the death of my mother but some internal systems in IT here. Just the other day, SAS could not open a full query of the EOL database because there wasn't enough free space on the server's hard drive for the workfiles. In discussing some of these issues with some good friends of mine in power trading, people whom I have known for over 10 years, they indicated they were ubiquitous here. The power traders have similar PC's to my new one, and they have complained from Day 1 that theirs are slower than their old ones.   Also, there remains a large frustration with the development of data warehouses; during my brief tenure here IT has gone through two differing proposals as to how to address this. When I have been told of tools available for real-time data harvesting, my requests for such have typically been met with \"well, we have it, but we haven't really tested it yet.\" An example is the weather: we still do not record to disk the hourly NWS observations from the GOES satellite.My interests here are to help Enron to do well, because I will do well only if Enron does well. These aren't empty words- my IRA is 1000% invested in the Enron stock fund. I believe my best contributions to Enron will be in the areas of systems as well as modeling, and the difficulty working in the Research Group, in terms of systems development, is that, frankly, few people at Enron seem to care what a researcher thinks about our systems. We aren't directly generating revenues for Enron, and we aren't really their customers, except in our relatively small deparrtmental infrastructure expenses.As it happens, Power Trading posted an opening for a Modeling and Forecasting person, and I spoke with them and they asked me to take the job, reporting to George Hopley. It is a wonderful opportunity for me, Vasant, as they are interested in large system modelng of power grids as well as improving their traders' access to real-time fundamentals data. I was completely candid with Kevin Presto regarding my shortcomings here in Research- I told him you were disgusted with me because I repeatedly failed to meet time deadlines. They also understand I have yet to be at Enron for 1 year, and thus may only bid on a job with your permission. We agree the move is good for Enron; we all work for Enron, and your acquiescence to the move does not endorse it but merely permit it. They are comfortable with me- they have known me for years as a hard worker, honest and unpretensive. They have already ordered a state-of-the-art Unix workstation and server for me, and they have told me they will commit whatever resources are necessary for me to be successful, including hiring an Analyst to work for me. And, I have already been able to teach their analysts improved techniques for data harvesting and analysis I have learned here.So, I am requesting your permission to bid for this job opening. It would be a lateral move in position and salary, and I would commit to you to help you in any way possible in the future with regards the Gas Model or the EOL database. I will continue to work on their improvement, and complete their documentation.As it happens, I am away on Enron business in Portland Monday and Tuesday, and will be back Wednesday. I had wanted to talk face-to-face instead of by email, but Enron business supercedes- I am on a team designing the data warehouse for floor trader support.Clayton.\n"

I am very excited to be back at Enron, and I hope to see the Research team again. I'd also like to inquire about summer positions within Research.? Will the Research group be taking on another intern this summer??? Since I know there is no busier place at Enron than the Research Group, if there is a position available for this summer that you are looking to fill or that may be open for consideration, I would love to connect you to another Rice student. Please let me know if the Group is considering receiving a new intern this summer.? If so, I would be thrilled to put you in touch with Brad Aimone, a senior chemical engineering student here at Rice who will be graduating with both his B.S. and his Masters in Chemical Engineering next May.? Brad has gained extensive laboratory research experience over the past two years.? His academic focus gives him a strong mathematical, quantitative background and excellent computer skills.? I believe his skills are transferable and relevant to the Group, and he is a deeply dedicated individual.? If the Research Group is looking for a summer intern, I hope it will continue Enron's strong support and recruit of Rice University students. Please feel free to contact Brad directly to pursue this discussion. (As I realize the summer months are not far off, if it is easier, an arrangement through ProStaff may be made similar to my work extension at the end of last summer).? I have attached a copy of his resume for your review.? Brad will be in Houston this summer.? His contact information is given below. James Bradley (Brad) Aimone 6320 Main, Houston, TX? 7770005 713-630-8035 imaknee@rice.edu ? Also, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.? I sincerely hope that you will have the opportunity to discover the contributions Brad can make to the Research Group.? I certainly know that he would gain tremendously from the experience as I did last summer. Thank you very much for your consideration. Sincerely, Van Ph: 713-630-8038   - Brad_Resume.doc\n"

And\rmoreover, business interests have recently led me to focus on electronic\r trading and brokerage\rissues.   A quick check of my web page will give you a good idea of the\rrange of my interests; see\rhttp:///www.stern.nyu.edu/~fdiebold.\r The upshot:   It seems to me that we would both benefit from a more\rextensive conversation.   I\rwould be happy to visit you in Houston to learn more about your\roperations, and to tell you more\rabout mine.

Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call option.The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and the valuations of the storage option.There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork. They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability mentioned above, or point-estimates (\"calibrations\") using only today's data based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price versus capacity similarly, \"competing\" for outflows.I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at your earliest convenience.Clayton\n"

My understandingis that Mark Courtney and Andrew Miles at Enron are championing John as alate addition to the program.While I know Enron doesn't routinely recruit at GSIA, John would be an idealcandidate if you are willing to make an exception.   He is a terrific financestudent with a strong transcript; including an A+ in my Options class. SinceJohn has an engineering/energy background, he asked early on for additionalbackground reading about finance and energy.   John is personable andoutgoing.   Normally the job market for someone of John's caliber would havealready cleared, but I have been told that there are dual career issues atplay here.I would be very appreciative if you would take a look at John.

Mark is the husband of Penny Pan, a UVa business school student for whom I was mentor last summer.   Penny has received a permanent offer and is inclined to accept if her husband can find suitable employment in Houston.   As you will see from his resume, Mark has worked as an economist in the public and private sectors for the past 2.5 years.   Mark is interested in a role where he can use his abilities to analyze political, credit currency and related risks.   Please let me know if you have any interest.   Thanks, RichJohn:   Is there a place here in EnronCredit.com?___Penny mentioned that you might have some ideas about job opportunitiesin Houston for someone with my background.   As you know, Penny waspleased to receive an offer from Enron and I plan to earnestly look intothe Houston job market myself.The weeks leading up to the annual IMF/World Bank meetings are one ofthe busiest times of year for us, but now that they are over I have had achance to update my resume (attached).   I would be grateful if youwould take a look and pass it on to anyone you think might be interested.As you will see, most of my background is policy related, and mostrecently international economic policy.   However the skills I havedeveloped have applicability in the private sector as well.   For example, alarge part of my job at the Treasury involves sovereign risk analysis.Two possible avenues I see for building on this knowledge are: 1)applying my knowledge to decisions regarding allocation of globalfinancial assets; or 2) identifying risks facing a mutinational company anddeveloping strategies to reduce that risk.I should mention that in addition to my economics training I do understandbasic finance, and I am preparing to begin the CFA.   I should also notethat the work environment here at the Treasury is quite fast paced, withconstant deadlines and a great deal of pressure placed on economists.   Itend to work 555+ hours per week so I do not expect I would need toadjust signifiantly if I were to move to the private sector.I greatly appreciate your taking the time to look at my resume and givingsome thought to where I might look.   I welcome any comments and ideasyou might have.Thanks,Mark Giancolap.s. the formatting on my resume seems to change whenever I e-mail it;let me know if you prefer that I fax it to you. - RESUME8.DOC\n"

Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=\r=20\rits industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20\rsolutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=\r=20\rCorp.

Greg Blair,=20\rformerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=\r=20\rCitizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=\r=20\rthis newly formed business.\r 2) Commercial Transactions:=20\r The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20\rDonahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=\r=20\rtransactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=\recuting=20\rtransactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=\r=20\rof client coverage.   CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20\rDevelopment, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20\rStructuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=\r=20\rAnalysis and Upstream Asset Management.\r The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=\r=20\rexecution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=\r=20\rwith the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=\r=20\rwhich will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.   This=\r=20\rdedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=\r=20\rand greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20\rresources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=\r=20\rthe highest value transactions across the coverage functions:\r a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=\r=20\rWestern Coverage/Origination Groups.   The senior members of this group=20\rinclude Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=\r=20\rLemmons joined Enron in 19992.   Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=\r=20\rCapital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=\r=20\rfrom Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20\rorigination.\rb) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=\rial=20\rorigination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20\rEnvironmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=\r=20\restablished.   The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=\r=20\rBoudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.   We anticipate announcing=\r=20\rtwo to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.\rc) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=\r=20\rServices and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.   The seni=\ror=20\rmembers of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=\rnd=20\rJohn House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 19996. Most recently, he was the=\r=20\rVice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.   We=\r=20\ranticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=\r=20\rweeks.\rd) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20\rFinance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.   The senior members of this team inclu=\rde=20\rBrad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.   We hope to announce the addition=\r=20\rof at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.\r Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=\r=20\rDownstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=\r=20\rresponsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.   Andrea Reed will=\r=20\rcontinue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=\r=20\rcommercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=\rl=20\rresponsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20\rCapital Structuring Group.   The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=\rn=20\rlargely unchanged.   In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20\rDevelopment teams and their respective origination groups will be located=\r=20\rtogether.\r We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=\re=20\rand industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=\ral=20\rmarkets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=\ren=20\rthe Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20\r Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=\rth=20\rAmerica by working with us to implement these changes.\r\n"

When you invoke Exceed (or LIM Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install itself the first time, and will then \"disappear\" to the Taskbar. you need to *right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose \"Tools\" and \"Client Startup\" and then \"New.\"You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow emulation. You need to specify the Host Type as Sun, enter your User Name and Password, set the Host Name to: capers.ect.enron.comand then, on the Command Line, type the following (carefully):/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -display @DThen, use the file menu to Save this as capers.xs and then click on the Run! menu. within a second or two, a window will open up with you logged into the serve capers. You are now on a Unix server, and the directory is your home directory. From here, if you simply type \"sas\" the 3 windows for an interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop. You are in business.5) you also need to install your ftp. follow the procedures with the software, and then create a new session called \"enron\" where you choose as the server simply \"earth\" (do not add any further descriptors such as .enron.com). supply your user name and *unix* password, check the \"remember password\" box, and the default communication setups should be correct (eg, host type as \"automatic detect\").when you invoke ftp and connect to enron, it will put you in your home directory on the Unix system, the same directory your xwindow comes up in under Exceed.if you have any problems, i'll be happy to helpClaytonPS i have a complete set of new SAS manuals i am happy to loan out if you'll just write your name down when you take them.\n"

When you invoke Exceed (or LIM Advanced User (under Infobases) if you already have this) it will install itself the first time, and will then \"disappear\" to the Taskbar. you need to *right* click on the taskbar on Exceed, and then choose \"Tools\" and \"Client Startup\" and then \"New.\"You will enter a box which should already be set for REXEC and an XWindow emulation. You need to specify the Host Type as Sun, enter your User Name and Password, set the Host Name to: capers.ect.enron.comand then, on the Command Line, type the following (carefully):/usr/openwin/bin/xterm -display @DThen, use the file menu to Save this as capers.xs and then click on the Run! menu. within a second or two, a window will open up with you logged into the serve capers. You are now on a Unix server, and the directory is your home directory. From here, if you simply type \"sas\" the 3 windows for an interactive session with SAS should open on your desktop. You are in business.5) you also need to install your ftp. follow the procedures with the software, and then create a new session called \"enron\" where you choose as the server simply \"earth\" (do not add any further descriptors such as .enron.com). supply your user name and *unix* password, check the \"remember password\" box, and the default communication setups should be correct (eg, host type as \"automatic detect\").when you invoke ftp and connect to enron, it will put you in your home directory on the Unix system, the same directory your xwindow comes up in under Exceed.if you have any problems, i'll be happy to helpClaytonPS i have a complete set of new SAS manuals i am happy to loan out if you'll just write your name down when you take them.\n"

Added value in shortening the time to process and deliver the finished surveys should generate more than $26 million per site (based upon $15/barrel for average oil well production to market 30 days sooner)in revenue.   By re-selling this data to market analysts or by internally using this data for forecasting future oil/gas production Enron could increase the accuracy of forecasting reserves and production capabilities globally.   By holding the data as exclusive (or partially exclusive), Enron would have a significant market advantage in futures pricing for oil and gas.(Vince's team is quantifying the valuation of this information)Attached please find an updated version of the business case for seismic data transfer via satellite, by a geophysicist at SpaceData - William K. Aylor, calculated using $222/barrel oil.Based upon your availability, Jon Adler and I would like to make a presentation to you (or your designated representative) on the Enron potential of this opportunity, sometime next week (17-20 October). - SDT Business Case4.pdfV.R.,Richard ReichardtEnron Broadband Services(713)-345-83777 (Office)(713)-907-3767 (Mobile)14000 Smith Street, Suite EB 4364 Houston, Texas   7770002\n"

These hackersalso use trickery such as pretending to be from tech support to getunsuspecting users to give up their username and password information.Serbian hackers used the technique to gain access to Web sitesregistered by Network Solutions, Inc., according to the Butler Group.The hackers then defaced these sites as a form of political and socialprotest.While no data was stolen, the incidents bring up an interesting point.While you may have security in place, it is still important to educateusers on security practices, such as never giving passwords or othersensitive information out to unknown people or Web sites. AOL warns itsusers all the time that administrators do not ask for passwordinformation when dealing with customers.Make sure your employees aren't unwittingly leaving the front door opento attack.One other note before we get to the latest alerts. Last week, a braincramp had me misreading information about the alleged backdoorpasswords in Microsoft software. The problem is associated withInterDev 1.0, not Version 7.0 as previously reported. Also, I wasremiss in not mentioning that Microsoft recommends deleting theDVWSSR.DLL library that installs as part of a number of Web softwareapplications, including FrontPage 98 Extensions. The library could beused in buffer overflow attacks.Now on with the latest patches and alerts:Panda Software warns of W95/CIH virusW95/CIH (or Chernobyl) is set to go active on April 26, the anniversaryof the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986. The virus infects variousexecutables with 1K byte of code, and on the 26th is set to destroy theFlash BIOS of Intel Pentium processors, rendering the computer uselessuntil the Flash BIOS is restored to its original settings.For more information:http:///www.pandasoftware.com/vernoticia.asp?noticia=674&amp;amp;idioma=2***Microsoft releases procedure to eliminate   \"Server-Side Image MapComponents\" vulnerabilityA vulnerability in several Web server products from Microsoft could leta malicious Web site visitor perform actions that the systempermissions allow, but could not have been accessed without this hole.The risk is in FrontPage 97 and 98 extensions htimage.exe andimagemap.exe, which provide server-side image-mapping support.Microsoft says the affect of this bug is limited, but the company isproviding a means of remedying the situation.For more information on the procedure:http:///www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq000-028.asp***Buffer overflow in Red Hat's imwheel moduleA buffer overflow condition in the imwheel module that comes with RedHat Powertools could allow a local user to execute arbitrary commandsas root.For more information:http:///bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/***Red Hat releases new openldap packagesThe new openldap package fixes a vulnerability in Red Hat LinuxVersions 6.1 and 6.2. The old version of the package creates a link tothe /tmp directory that is world writable. This could allow users todestroy any file on a mounted file system.For more information:http:///bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla***RealNetworks releases patch for denial-of-service vulnerability inRealServerRealNetworks' RealServer streaming media server contains avulnerability that could allow a malicious user to cause a stackoverflow and shut down the system until it is rebooted by anadministrator. RealNetworks says the problem lies in the PNAprotocol-handling scheme.Download the patch:http:///service.real.com/help/faq/servg270.html***Bug in Netscape Navigator could allow others to view bookmarksA flaw has been discovered in Netscape Navigator that could allow amalicious Web site operator to view a person's bookmark file. By usinga combination of JavaScripts, cookies and frames, an operator couldview the contents of a bookmark file, if the browser user is set to\"default.\" Also, support for cookies and JavaScript needs to be turnedon. The problem could be part of Microsoft Internet Explorer as well.While no code can be run on the client machine, the problem couldexpose private information in the bookmark file.http:///www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,25553337,000.html***Patch available for \"Malformed Environment Variable\" vulnerabilityA vulnerability in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 could allow amalicious user to make some or all of the memory on a serverunavailable, effectively slowing and shutting down the machine. TheCMD.EXE command processor has an unchecked buffer in part of the codethat handles environment strings. Microsoft does not believe this to bea major threat.For more information:http:///www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq000-027.asp***Patch available for \"Mixed Object Access\" vulnerabilityMicrosoft scores the hat trick with its third vulnerability of theweek. This patch fixes a limited problem in Windows NT 4.0 and 2000that could allow a user to change information in Active Directorywithout permission. The scope of the problem is very small and onlypertains to certain object attributes.For more information:http:///www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq000-026.asp***WM97/Astia-AI reported in the wild by SophosMany people like to write these Word macro viruses. For hackers, thesemust be the equivalent of the little Pascal programs that sorted simplelists, which I had to write back in my early days as a computer sciencemajor. Hackers must start with these viruses before jumping to the bigleagues of distributed-denial-of-service attacks. This particularstrain creates Book.dot and Book.src files in the Word StartUpdirectory and affects the Normal.dot file. The virus will pop up awindow titled \"TITANUS\" if a user enters the Visual Basic Macro Editor.It will then attempt to infect an open document. Just another pain tobe aware of.For more information:http:///www.sophos.com/virusinfo/analyses/wm97astiaai.html***Georgi Guninski reports another IE problemGeorgi Guninski is the king of finding bugs in Microsoft InternetExplorer. This time, Guninski has found an error in the way Microsoftimplements its Java Virtual Machine that could circumvent the cross-frame security policy built into the browser. This could allowmalicious users to use the Document Object Model to gain access tofiles on a vulnerable machine. Guninski reports that fixing the problemis not as easy as turning off Active Scripting.For a demonstration of the problem:http:///www.nat.bg/~joro/jsinject.html***Problem with Panda Security 3.0DeepZone is reporting a problem with Panda Security 3.0's key handling.Local users could override their privileges and gain access toadministrator rights.

Each day, he went off to his job as chief economist and No. 3 manat the World Bank, where he and his colleagues had come up with a consensusof how to contain the spreading crisis. Each day, he got increasinglyfrustrated as the bank's proposals were overruled by its sister organization,the International Monetary Fund, influenced strongly by what Stiglitz callsthe IMF's \"largest shareholder,\" the U.S. Treasury Department.Especially frightening to Stiglitz was the IMF's rescue plan for Indonesia,East Asia's most populous country after China. The fund directed theIndonesian government to cut social spending and raise interest rates,policies designed to draw panicked overseas investors back into the country.But Stiglitz argued that sudden cuts, particularly in food and kerosenesubsidies, could trigger social unrest in the fragile island nation, and thatthe violence might take an ugly ethnic turn. The Chinese minority there hadalready started to worry.\"My kids were writing school papers about people who remained silent duringthe Holocaust in Europe,\" Stiglitz remembered recently. \"So you ask yourselfthe question: 'Do you remain silent and play the system, or do you speakout?' Why have a job with responsibility if you don't speak out?\"The IMF imposed its plan, and just as Stiglitz and the World Bank hadpredicted, ethnic conflict swept across Indonesia, leaving hundreds dead.By then, however, the economist was speaking out on Indonesia and otherinternational economic matters --- an action that earned him the enmity ofLawrence Summers, now Secretary of the Treasury, then in a lesser role at theagency, and other officials at the Treasury and the IMF. Their hostility, heasserts, led to his departure from the World Bank earlier this year.Today, from the outside, Stiglitz is increasing his criticism of the U.S.Treasury/IMF policy toward Asia, Latin America and Russia, which is stillfundamentally unchanged despite the great scare of 19997-98. Stiglitz himselfmay not join the expected protests this week in Washington at the IMF/WorldBank annual meetings. But the intellectual rigor and creativity that has puthim on just about everyone's short list for the Nobel Prize in Economics willprovide powerful support for the critics.The MalcontentWhen Stiglitz left the World Bank, press accounts described him as \"amalcontent,\" \"a great nuisance\" and \"a scourge of the Washingtonestablishment.\" In person, however, he seems pleasant and enthusiastic, notsour or contentious. Even when asked about his No. 1 opponent, LawrenceSummers, he was never hostile, maintaining a kind of bemused detachment aboutthe Treasury Secretary; he chuckled when he recollected how Summers \"wentballistic\" after one of his critical speeches.Joseph Stiglitz's disagreements with the so-called Washington Consensus areintellectual and not personal. He recognizes that he leans to the liberalside of the spectrum, but he also insists that his views are not based onsentiment, but on what he calls \"good economic science.\"Stiglitz: \"Do you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?\"Take, for instance, the World Bank's response as the Asian crisis unfolded.After Thailand's devaluation in July 19997, the Bank started to get datashowing that the country's financial crisis was triggering a depression --- asevere downturn that would soon spread to Indonesia, South Korea and HongKong. To Stiglitz, who had earlier been chairman of President Clinton'sCouncil of Economic Advisers, the pattern looked familiar. \"I was approachingit much as I would if I were advising the President of the United States,recommending stimulatory policies to counter the decline,\" he remembers.Instead, the Treasury/IMF in tandem overruled the Bank and did the preciseopposite, directing the beleaguered Asian countries, as a condition forgetting the bailout emergency loans, to raise interest rates and to reducegovernment spending, including the all-important food and fuel subsidies.Today, Stiglitz still cannot hide his astonishment at these contractionarypolicies. The Washington Consensus argued that the measures were necessary torestore overseas investor confidence, stabilize falling exchange rates andattract capital back into the afflicted countries. But he points out thattheir economic models were far too narrow, and therefore doomed to fail.For example, the Treasury/IMF strategy ignored the potential forbankruptcies. The sky-high interest rates forced even sound companies inThailand and Indonesia to the wall, which wasn't the best way to re-inspireforeign investors. At the same time, the sharp cuts in government spendingstimulated violence across Indonesia, which did not build confidenceoverseas, either.Stiglitz insists that \"these political and social concerns are not outsidethe economic model.\" He knew that over the years, unrest had been frequent inthe developing world following the imposition of austerity plans. Indeed,austerity-inspired uprisings are routinely called \"IMF riots.\" But when heraised his doubts, within channels, he says, \"It was like hitting your headagainst the wall.\"Stiglitz has other pungent criticisms of the Washington Consensus:He questions the Treasury/IMF insistence that emerging nations endrestrictions on capital flows. He points out that vulnerability to hot moneycan worsen crises, emphasizing that some countries, such as China, haveachieved significant rates of growth without making their currencies fullyconvertible.He continues to criticize Western policy toward Russia. He argues that thecrash privatization program, in a country with no working democratic, legalor financial regulatory system, created a corrupt new oligarchy that blockseconomic growth. He is particularly biting about the IMF's 19998 Russianbailout. \"Was this a good investment?\" he asks. \"You put in $6 billion ...that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the nextday. Clearly the country is worse off, and everybody knew it was going tohappen.\"He has strong objections to the IMF's policy of \"conditionality\" --- of makingloans to countries contingent on far-reaching internal changes. \"Of course,any lender will need evidence the loan can be repaid,\" he recognizes. \"Butthe conditionalities the IMF imposes have gone well beyond anything requiredfor repayment.\"Now that Stiglitz is outside the system, he's expanding his critique. He willdivide his time between the Brookings Institution in Washington, teaching atStanford and working on a book about his experiences on the inside.Not surprisingly, he comes down hardest on the U.S. Treasury/IMFpolicymakers. They embody what Stiglitz calls \"the theory of escalatingcommitment.\" By that he means, \"The cost of continuing mistakes is borne byothers, while the cost of admitting mistakes is borne by yourself.\"Finally, he asserts, Treasury/IMF bureaucrats are following the dictates ofan ideology, not testing economic models in a scientific way.Stiglitz uses the term \"market Bolsheviks\" to describe the advisers whohelped bring Russia to its economic knees in the 19990s --- people who believedfervently in a rigid fundamentalist doctrine and tried to force an entiresociety to conform to it, just as their central planning predecessors haddone back in Lenin's day.The economist savors one final irony. IMF policy makers never apply theiranti-state orthodoxy to their own organization. \"Intellectual consistency,\"he says, \"should lead them to ask themselves, 'If we believe that governmentbureaucrats are always incompetent, then why are we an exception?He points out that the spread of democracy, accountability, good governanceand transparency are applauded around the world, at least in theory, andasks: \"Is it right for an international organization to be the instrument ofpolitical change? Those of us who are committed to democracy are veryuncomfortable with a bunch of international bureaucrats playing the role ofGod. Sometimes, they may play the role in the right way, but they can alsooverturn democratically elected governments.\"In a sense, Joseph Stiglitz resembles another economist, who worked for theBritish Treasury and attended the 1919 Versailles peace negotiations afterthe First World War. John Maynard Keynes was so disturbed at what he sawthere that he resigned his post and wrote The Economic Consequences of thePeace, an impassioned polemic that eerily predicted that the harsh andpunitive economic settlement the Allies had imposed on Germany would createterrible unrest and \"sow the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe.\"\"\"What was great about Keynes was the combination of someone who used analyticpowers but who didn't distance himself from the human cost,\" Stiglitzobserves. \"During the Vietnam War, we tried to distance ourselves by talkingabout body counts. In economics, we talk about unemployment rates, so wedon't see the people. The challenge is, how do you remain analyticallyhonest, but not lose the human dimension?\"---\n"

My phone number is (617) 492-95551.   I graduated from Princeton University in 19996 (mathematics), and came straight to MIT for aPh.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.   In my firstthree years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses inpsychology (at MIT and Harvard).   I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.   Inparticular, I am interested in the interaction between customers andcompanies (hence the interest in psychology).   The (tentative) title of myPhD thesis is \"Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet\", and I amsending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that willgive you an idea of what this research is about.Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your researchgroup next week.PauloPricing Substitute Products on the InternetObjective:To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services soldonthe internet.Motivation:This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and optimizationmodels are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.   The technologicalinnovations associated with the internet brought about an overload ofinformationwhich inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.Furthermore,companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers canhave access to.The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issuefacedby internet companies.   Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.VCRsor computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.   Companies can showdifferent products and different prices to each consumer.   This type offlexibilitywas not available until the internet came about.The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.   Themethodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number ofother settings, such as pricing services.   Services are unique, and there aremany cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by agiven company.   Our model will help companies decide which services to offerto which customers and how much to charge for these services.Research Strategy:Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two componentswhich can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.   Thesecomponents are choice models and optimization models.Choice Models:Choice models describe how customers make choices.   The management literaturedraws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.   Thecommon approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristicelimination methods.   These methods consist of the elimination of optionsbased on the sequential elimination of features until only one choiceremains.These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves veryeasily to mathematical analysis.   Economists focus on utility-maximing modelsthat are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychologicalmodels.The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.   The problem withthese types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of howconsumer make choices on the internet.   The first step in our research willbeto develop choice models that capture the interactions going on betweencustomersand companies on the internet.Optimization:Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over acertain planning horizon.   On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenuestill exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.   Short termprofit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you knowyour customers and are able to retain them.   The optimization problem musttherefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component(learning).\n"

Currently, I am a third yearPh.D. student at the Economics Department of   theUniversity of Houston. At the end of this semesterI'll be completing my coursework and starting to writemy dissertation which analyzes the access pricingissue in network industries, especially in electricitytransmission.I would like to give you a few examples from mycoursework. In addition to basic Statistics I-II andEconometrics I-II, I have taken \"MacroeconomicModeling and Forecasting\" (Time Series) class in whichI learned RATS. In \"Applied Econometrics\" class, itwas given a great deal of attention to the case methodlearning approach that involved extensive computeranalysis. We were taught SAS. As a term paper I workedon electricity demand forecasting. This semester I amtaking \"Special Topics in Applied Econometrics\" coursein which I am being taught Qualitative DependentModels, MLE, Panel Data Techniques, and so on, and assoftware STATA. Moreover, this semester I am alsotaking \"Options Theory and Its Applications\" class andauditing Dr. Kao's class. I definitely agree with youin what you mentioned in your lecture last Mondayabout the understanding of the options theory as anecessity in the energy sector.Besides, I spent my last summer in the Oil and Gasunit of the World Bank as a research assistant. Thiswork experience in which I had great exposure to theenergy market issues and my own research area, whichis regulation of transmission pricing (congestionpricing), made me believe that the ongoingrestructuring of the electricity sector, especiallythe transmission network issue, could be wellunderstood by working in the industry.Dr. Kaminski, attached you can find my resume. I wouldbe glad if you could find a chance to review it andget back to me soon.Many thanks,===Sevil YamanDepartment of EconomicsUniversity of HoustonHouston, TX 777204-58882(713) 743-3814 / 3817___Do You Yahoo!?Talk to your friends online with Yahoo!

Now that we have had several traders managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to discuss them.Please let me know if you are unable to attend.\n"

Companies want to\rgain a competitive advantage by defining new sales opportunities faster\rthan their rivals, fulfilling customers information queries quickly,\rand cutting their time to market with new products and services.\r That often means finding a high-speed mechanism for filing and\rretrieving business data.\r Network-attached storage (NAS) is one way around the slowdowns and\rservice interruptions that occur in a conventional file server model.\rThe shortcomings with the file server model were discussed in last\rweek=01,s newsletter, but essentially they center on the file server=01,s\rrole as a gatekeeper.   In this setup, the file server sits in front of\rstorage systems typically connected to disk arrays by a SCSI bus in a\rparallel cabling scheme. File servers read and write all storage\rrequests from users and other servers, and only one file server has\raccess to the disks that hold stored files.   The file server can become\ra single point of failure or a bottleneck.\r NAS effectively moves storage out from behind the server and puts it\rdirectly on the transport network. Unlike file servers that have SCSI\rand LAN adapters, a NAS appliance uses a network interface card to\rtransmit LAN and storage communications.\r These specialized storage devices bring with them some major benefits\rover file server systems. Because they don=01,t require a file server, any\ruser with access rights, anywhere on the network, can directly access\rstored data.   This removes any delay posed by slow file server hardware\ror operating systems.   NAS devices are also optimized to process\rstorage I/O transactions much faster than conventional parallel SCSI\rschemes.\r NAS appliances use a common file server access protocol, so they can\rprocess requests from systems around a network, running multiple types\rof operating systems. Any system, whether it is a Windows NT server or\ra Unix box, can access the NAS device.   This solves cross-platform\rissues that arise frequently in today=01,s heterogeneous enterprises.\r NAS also mitigates the physical complexity associated with file servers\rthat use parallel SCSI buses to connect servers to storage disks.   NAS\ralleviates the awkward setups of parallel cabling, host bus adapters,\rand termination that are part and parcel of a file server\rimplementation.   Companies simply plug the system into the network and\rit is ready to go.   Many NAS appliance vendors claim an installation\rtakes less than an hour.\r Yet for all its advantages over a file server model, one drawback of\rNAS is that it shifts storage transactions from parallel SCSI\rconnections to the production network.   This means the LAN has to\rhandle both normal end-user traffic and storage disk requests,\rincluding backup operations.\r Thus, NAS doesn=01,t resolve one of the core issues associated with file\rservers   bandwidth consumption during backups.   Unlike storage-area\rnetworks, which remove back-up traffic from the LAN, NAS still uses the\rproduction network for backup and recovery.\r That said, NAS technology still supplies companies with an easy-to-\rdeploy solution for resolving cross-platform issues while speeding\raccess to stored files.\r To contact Amy Larsen DeCarlo:\r---\rAmy Larsen DeCarlo is an analyst with Enterprise Management Associates\rin Boulder, Colo., (http:///www.enterprisemanagement.com), a leading\ranalyst and market research firm focusing exclusively on all aspects of\renterprise management.

Some have the company being acquired -\rby, among others, IBM, Lucent, Cisco, Sun and AT&amp;T - while\rothers see the company selling off its best technologies\r(eDirectory and file caching) to separate companies.\r Neither of these will happen in the near future, the next six\rto 12 months. The company is making money, although not a lot\rof money, and it does have a significant amount of cash on hand\rwith little or no outstanding debt. But because the stock price\ris currently so low ($9 to $10 per share over the past few\rmonths), sale of the company wouldn't bring in enough to\rsatisfy the stockholders. And any company offering what Novell\rstockholders want would be in trouble with its own\rstockholders.\r Selling off technologies makes even less sense, since it would\rleave Novell with more cash (which it doesn=01,t need) and fewer\rproducts to sell.\r Instead, watch as new marketing and sales programs are launched\rin the fall. These will either boost sales back to 1999 levels\ror precipitate a wholesale turnover of top management, leading\rto more rumors of a sellout. And those rumors might be true.\r To contact Dave Kearns:\r---\rDave Kearns is the Word Wrangler for Virtual Quill, a writing\ragency serving the computer and networking industries.

With the mountains of information available about Linux,\rit can be hard for network professionals to keep up with Linux news that\ris fresh and relevant to their jobs. Here each week, you will find Linux\rindustry news, tips and examples of how Linux is being used in\renterprise networks.   Jumping right in, this week=01,s topic will focus on\rhow Linux can be used to turn an old PC into a network router.\r When people talk about a Linux box, what generally comes to mind is\reither a server or client machine running some distribution of Linux.\rOne way for users to use Linux outside =01&amp;the box=018 is with the Linux\rRouter Project=01,s distribution of the operating system.\r The Linux Router Project (LRP) is a microdistribution of Linux (it fits\ron a 1.444M byte floppy) that can be used along with some extra hardware\rto turn a variety of low-end PCs into practical, useable network gear.\rAdditionally, as with most Linux distributions, the software is free.\r A variety of different network devices can be put together using LRP.\rFor instance, using just an Intel 486 PC with a floppy drive, 12M bytes\rof RAM and at least two network interface cards, LRP can be used to\rassemble a 10M bit/sec Ethernet router. For higher speeds, a Fast\rEthernet router can be assembled with a simple Pentium 1000 or higher,\ralong with 16M bytes of RAM and 10/1000M bit/sec network interface cards.\rLRP can also be configured as a secondary Domain Name System firewall, a\rRemote Authentication Dial-In User Service and a WAN router with DSU\rfunctionality. LRP routers support standard routing protocols, such as\rRouting Information Protocol and Open Shortest Path First. Advanced\rrouting protocols are also supported, such as IPX for NetWare networks\rand Token Ring.\r Building a Linux router out of spare parts can be useful when setting up\ra testing environment that requires the simulation of live router\rtraffic. It=01,s also more practical than disconnecting your live\rcommercial routing equipment for use in testing purposes. LRP can also\rbe put into a live production environment as a way to add extra routers\rto a network for a minimal cost.\r Because Linux routers can be built with standard PC components, the\rmaterials to build one are likely sitting in a storage room or back\rcloset somewhere in your office. LRP is a completely free, open source\roperating system   so if you can program, you can add functions such as\rMulti-protocol Label Switching and load balancing to the router by\rwriting customized code.\r If you are not a Linux hacker, odds are someone else has already written\rthe code for these types of functions. Start at\rhttp:///www.linuxsupportline.com to find these kinds of modules. As with many free software products,\ryour best source of support for LRP will be the Web. An extensive list\rof FAQs and tips on using LRP can be found at\rhttp:///www.linuxrouter.org/faq.   Since LRP is developed and distributed mostly by volunteers, download\raccess to the software is not always very fast. The easiest way to get\rit is to log on to http:///www.linux-howto.com, which has a search engine\rfor Linux documentation and free distributions. Type in =01&amp;Linux Router=01=\r8\rin the search field, and it will let you choose what geographical region\rto download the LRP software and source code from for optimal speed. You\rcan also try several of these mirror sites to download LRP:\r ftp:///ftp.cpwright.com/linux-router/\rftp:///lrp.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/distributions/linux-router/\rftp:///sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/linux-router/\rftp:///ftp.xtdnet.nl/pub/linux/linux-router/\rftp:///sunsite.ktu.lt/pub/linux/distributions/linux-router/\rftp:///mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/linux/linux-router/\rftp:///ftp.clear.net.nz/pub/linux-router/\rftp:///mailtrans.sote.hu/linuxrouter/\rftp:///ftp.di.fct.unl.pt/pub/linux/linux-router/\rftp:///ftp.wipol.uni-bonn.de/pub/mirror/ftp.linuxrouter\r To contact Phil Hochmuth:\r---\rPhil Hochmuth is a writer and researcher for Network World, and a former\rsystems integrator.

I also included the short-term models so this is now a self-standing spreadsheet, but probably still needs cleaning up a bit.ZIMIN &amp; STINSON:We agreed on short-term and long-term models for DZCV and PLLU PPI indices in a meeting with Dale and Trena and a simple smoothing is employed to give the results as follows.

American Gas TeamE-Mail Category: AlertProduct Line: North American Gas ,URL: http:///www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=51666&amp;amp;m=12221 ,The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to between $4.30 and $4.40 per million British thermal units (MMBtu)---up from less than $3.000 per MMBtu in April. Behind this has been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day below last year's pace.The weak injection rate so far this season reinforces the pressure---last week's injections of only 8.0 Bcf per day compare with last May's injections of over 10.0 Bcf per day. If this trend were to continue throughout the summer, gas inventory levels would not meet minimum acceptable levels for next winter's heating season, which CERA believes to be between 2.65 and 2.7 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) of working gas in storage by October 31. Indeed, injections for June to October must ramp up to an average of 8.1 Bcf per day, 0.4 Bcf per day higher than last year's rate, for inventories to approach 2.7 Tcf, a level that still exposes the market to shortage late next winter. Even reaching this level will be a challenge and will require that demand be priced out of the market. This growing realization has sent the market into a panic.Although the forces that have pushed the gas market to this level are not a surprise---indeed they have been building for over a year---the resulting price level is shocking nonetheless. It highlights the challenge of pushing prices high enough to choke off demand and to free gas supplies for storage. Unlike years past, the gas market pressures this year come at a time when there is little flexibility in energy markets overall. Indeed, power markets are headed into the peak summer months with generation capacity still largely constrained in most markets; this is likely to result in a higher incremental call on gas than ever before---with only limited ability to switch to alternative fuels. At the same time oil prices remain above $30 per barrel, making the cost of switching particularly high. All these forces combine to suggest that the current market pressure is far from an aberration---and it raises the question: \"Where will it stop?\"There are breaking points in the market that are currently being tested---many of them involving industrial and feedstock uses of gas. Few of these currently cost below $4.000 per MMBtu, and many are currently above $5.000 per MMBtu. How high prices go and how long they stay there depends very much on the strength of the underlying market pressures. We expect to see the following reactions:* Power generation: incremental gas-to-residual fuel oil switching. The Atlantic Coast dual-fuel market is already providing the first demand response to higher prices. Given the late May climb in gas prices relative to residual fuel oil prices, a significant portion of the 1.5 Bcf per day dual-fuel market has switched from burning gas earlier in the month to burning residual fuel oil. This summer, CERA expects virtually all logistically and environmentally feasible dual-coal load to burn residual fuel oil. This will result in an incremental 6000 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day loss of gas demand from these plants relative to last summer (and relative to early May). However, to keep that load burning residual fuel oil, gas prices will have to sustain premiums of $0.05 to $0.25 per MMBtu above 1% residual fuel oil prices at New York Harbor to price out switchable capacity in the Northeast. Premiums to Gulf Coast residual fuel oil will be required to price out Florida and Mis!sissippi/Alabama switchable capacity. Despite this fuel switching activity, CERA expects overall gas demand for power generation to climb by 3.0 Bcf per day from May into June as overall power demand increases.* Reductions in ammonia production. CERA expects a loss in gas demand for ammonia production, even with the recent strength in ammonia pricing. Ammonia prices have softened somewhat from their highest levels of a few weeks ago, but were still at $165 per short ton over the past week. At these price levels, US ammonia margins began to disappear as gas moved above $4.000 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub. Given the strong gas prices, CERA expects a sustained period of negative ammonia margins. Last summer when ammonia margins disappeared, a sizeable portion of the North American ammonia production capacity closed; at its most extreme in August, gas demand for ammonia was down by 0.4 Bcf per day. This demand reduction is likely to be repeated for much of this summer. The closing of ammonia capacity should lend some support to ammonia prices. Last summer in response to ammonia closures, ammonia prices climbed by about $15 per short ton. This feedback effect would keep a tight balance on! price. For example, raising the ammonia price to $180 per short ton allows the industry on average to maintain a margin until the Henry Hub price reaches $4.50 per MMBtu. There are limits, of course. Ultimately, high gas prices will not shutter the entire domestic ammonia industry, which uses approximately 1.6 Bcf per day in fuel and feedstock.* Ethane rejection. In previous gas price spikes or periods of low oil prices, processors have elected to leave ethane in the gas stream, providing an incremental source of gas supply. The observed difference in ethane production levels in recent years demonstrates a flexibility to add approximately 6000 MMcf per day of gas supply, should extracting ethane from the gas stream become clearly unprofitable. Strength in oil and products markets this year, however, makes such an addition to gas supply highly unlikely. Last week (May 222-26) Mont Belvieu ethane priced above $5.50 per MMBtu (over $0.36 per gallon), with propane pricing over $0.54 per gallon. Given these products prices, gas prices of $5.000 in the Gulf Coast and $4.25 in the Rockies would be required before processors leave significant quantities of ethane in the gas stream. In addition, propane, the major alternate to ethane in the petrochemical sector, is currently in short supply. The result is that until world oil! markets loosen, allowing imports of propane, ethane is likely to follow gas upward, should gas even reach the ethane price. Unless gas prices rise significantly from current levels, or until oil markets themselves weaken, CERA does not expect ethane rejection to add much to gas supply this summer.* Methanol. Methanol margins are also suffering with current gas prices, even given recent healthy methanol prices. Methanol prices are being supported by the return of Asian demand; specific plant outages, including several ammonia feeder plants in Trinidad; and the late startup of several world-scale methanol plants, including plants in Trinidad, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. Although recent spot methanol prices have risen well above $0.60 per gallon, contract prices in the $0.50 range would imply production shutdowns when gas prices are above $4.000 per MMBtu. A significant portion of methanol plants having already shut down last summer, only a small incremental amount of gas demand is expected to be lost with further shutdowns in methanol production, perhaps 0.1 Bcf per day.* Fuel switching to distillate. With distillate prices well above $5.000 per MMBtu, distillate is not expected to provide a major source of demand relief unless the pressure intensifies extensively and prices spike further. For next winter, however, fuel switching to distillate could become an important force taking the pressure off gas markets---particularly on the East Coast. That said, distillate inventories are currently low. To the extent this continues through the end of the year, it would set up a repeat of what occurred last winter in the Northeast when prices in both distillate and gas markets spiked.In total there is certainly the potential to provide well in excess of 2.0 Bcf per day of cushion through a combination of reduced consumption and some localized ethane rejection in the Rockies and eastern Gulf---plus a marginal increase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports (up to 0.1 MMcf per day). But currently such a reduction in consumption would require an even greater increase in prices. For now the gas market appears to have reached a very tenuous resistance point in the $4.25-$4.50 per MMBtu range---a level that should result in \"choking off\" an incremental 0.8 to 1.1 Bcf per day of gas demand (relative to two weeks ago) from the combination of additional fuel switching to residual fuel oil and reduced feedstock demand for gas (see Table 1). However, as we move through June and into July even slightly warmer-than-normal temperatures could add an additional 1.0 Bcf per day of highly inelastic demand for power generation (relative to normal weather) and force prices ev!en higher to balance the market. CERA estimates that it would take prices in the $5.000 to $5.25 per MMBtu range to rationalize this extra demand---principally through a combination of ethane rejection and additional reductions in feedstock demand for gas. This deep a reduction inevitably would force price reactions in petrochemical markets---pushing gas prices up even further.There are also limited forces that could drive the market lower---and remove some of the panic. Mild temperatures through June would provide the most significant impact by allowing more breathing room for storage injections. Any movement by OPEC to increase crude oil output could also help lower the fuel switching threshold points. But even if both these forces were to act, we estimate this would move gas prices back down only into the $3.50 to $4.000 per MMBtu range. If prices fell any lower, demand would surge from a return of feedstock demand and fuel switching back to gas. For these reasons, CERA has raised its Henry Hub price outlook for the third quarter of 2000 to $4.18 per MMBtu, and the average for the year to $3.67 per MMBtu.***end***Follow URL for PDF version of this Alert with associated table.Please note: Should the above URL not work, please use the following: http:///www.cera.com/client/nag/alt/0601000_15/nag_alt_0601000_15_ab.html***CERA's Spring 2000 Roundtable event dates and agendas are now available athttp:///www.cera.com/event***Account ChangesTo edit your personal account information, including your e-mailaddress, etc. go to: http:///eprofile.cera.com/cfm/edit/account.cfmThis electronic message and attachments, if any, contain informationfrom Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Inc.

Although the snowball has juststarted rolling, current plans by natural storage operators will boostworking capacity by 430 Bcf, or 10%, and will raise peak-day deliverability111.8 Bcf per day, or 13.8%, according to a new survey by Intelligence Press.Intelligence Press' new multimedia research package provides a comprehensivelook at all current activity on 458 storage fields with additional keyinformation on 101 LNG facilities. Among them are 38 proposed natural gasstorage fields and 15 storage expansion projects. Depleted fields capture thelargest share of the proposed fields with 24, followed by aquifers with six,and salt domes and salt beds with four each. Altogether the proposed newfields account for about 329 Bcf in working capacity and 9.7 Bcf per day indeliverability.   Proposed and potential expansions represent an increase ofabout 1000.5 Bcf of working capacity and 2.1 Bcf per day in deliverability.But these projects are just the tip of the iceberg. Regulatory changes,shifting natural gas flows and increases in demand due to growth in theeconomy and particularly in natural gas fired power generation are expectedto cause significant additional storage growth in the next decade.

Second, I need a completedapplication form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriateboxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in aform.Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Fridayso plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if youcan.   Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants andinteresting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across theplaza from the hotel).We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner onFriday and Saturday evenings.   The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of theAlamo at 8:000 p.m.   For Saturday we are still working out plans for theevening so stay tuned.There will be more information later as the conference nears.

Enron honored this year's recipients of theEnron MBA Excellence Fund Scholars at a dinner in Austin.   In addition tothe three recipients, Business School Dean May and several of mycolleagues, Enron attendees included Sally Beck, Cindy Justice, KarenMarshall (newly-appointed coordinator of higher education initiatives forEnron Community Relations Dept.) and Rick Causey.I write you at this time to advise you I had occasion to discuss twocurrent Enron/UT issues with Rick:I.   Spring 20001 Conference Participation by Jeffrey K. SkillingII.   UT Participation in EnronTraining ActivitiesPer my conversation with Rick last Thur., I followed up on that discussionwith an e-mail this morn that touched on those two topics.I.   With respect to the first, I wrote Rick this morning that:1.   We at the UT Center for Energy Finance Education and Research (CEFER)are planning a practitioner-industry Conference in Spring 20001 (late Feb.or early March) to discuss four topics:   Risk management, Deregulation,Real options, and International/globalization.2.   The Conference will kick off with a dinner/keynote address Thur.evening, then continue all day Fri.3.   I have had several discussions with you regarding Conference timing,structure, participation and content.4.   Further to Rick's agreement to do so during our discussion last Thur.,in today's e-mail I asked Rick to extend an invitation to Jeff Skilling tobe the keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.II.   With respect to the second topic, Rick and I also discussed UTpartcipation in Enron Corp. internal training for incoming Enron Corp.analysts and associates.   Consequently, I e-mailed Rick this morning aspecific set of issues --- \"Valuation and Risk Management in Energy Markets\"--- which my UT colleagues and I have covered in public as well ascustomized exec ed settings, and which we would be pleased to customize forpresentation at Enron.

The fax you sent me to explain the risk calculation suggested that you use a 5 day period of adjustment to calculate the risk (in this case it is called Capital at Risk). The VaR calculation for our model is for a one day holding period which means that your risk factorwill be reduced by a factor equal the sqrt(5) or 2.24. Since :Old risk factor (%) =   1.65*(std of the price movement) = 3.999% New daily risk factor = 3.999/2.24   = 1.78%   which actually equates to std of approx 1.1% a day.I am happy with this as a estimate of the vol as the annualized spot vol we are showing for Cu is approx 19% which equates to approx 1.2% daily.Using this new risk factor for the daily VaR the Cu positions would give a VaR (for the 19th) of approx $2m which is less that the figure we estimated ($3,1000,568).The other thing is that by taking net numbers we are disregarding the term structure of the price curve/vol curve and position curve and are hence collapsing everything into a one factor model which means that it is difficult to compare the numbers.I hope that this helps to explain our number.Hopefully we can talk tomorrow,CheersKirstee \n"

COMMENT &amp; ANALYSIS: Stretching the figures: Calculating   accurate values for companies in the new economy takes more   than a grasp of mathematics - a dash of economics, politics and   logic would not go amiss, says John Kay:   COMMENT &amp; ANALYSIS: Stretching the figures: Calculating accurate   values for companies in the new economy takes more than a grasp of   mathematics - a dash of economics, politics and logic would not go   amiss, says John Kay:   87% match; Financial Times ; 24-Apr-2000 12:000:000 am ; 11170 words   Do the math. The slogan favoured by Jim Clark, creator of Silicon Graphics,   Net-scape and Healtheon, has become the mantra of a generation of   consultants and investment bankers. The new economy, they claim, requires   new principles of valuation.   C.com is one of the most exciting prospects in business-to-business   commerce. It is the world leader in a growing market - annual sales by 2010   are likely to be Dollars 5000,000bn. If C.com can maintain a 5 per cent share   and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective annual earnings will be   Dollars 250bn.   If we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent and discount future   revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of C.com is Dollars 5,000bn -   about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of Microsoft, Cisco or General   Electric.   You don't have to wait for the IPO. You can buy shares in C.com right now for   less than 5 per cent of that value. C.com is called Citigroup and in addition to   its foreign exchange trading, which is the business I have described, you get   its other wholesale, retail and investment banking activities and a leading   insurance company thrown in.   Of course, nobody would be so stupid as to value Citigroup in this way. Yet I   have followed more or less exactly the methodology recommended in the   latest McKinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era companies. They use   precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation of Dollars 37bn for   Amazon.com.   Paul Gibbs, head of merger and acquisition research at J.P. Morgan, recently   used similar principles to confirm that assessment of Amazon. He then   performed the same calculation for internet service provider Freeserve.   Assume that UK retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year, that 25 per cent of   sales take place on the net, that portals capture 50 per cent of these, that   Freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and maintains an 8 per cent   commission on sales. Multiply these together and you establish that in 2017   Freeserve will make profits of o2bn (Dollars 3.2bn). This, he argues, justifies a   value today of o6.50 per share.   But I prefer T.com to Freeserve. T.com has a customer base four times larger   than Freeserve. Its franchise is stronger. Its customers are concentrated in   the affluent south-east of England, where it faces virtually no competition.   Market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its customers use its   essential services every day, many of them several times a day.   T.com also has ambitious plans for expansion. At present, its geographical   coverage is less than one-quarter of the market in England and Wales. T.com   has an interest in south-east Asia. The population of China is 1000 times the   number of people who today can access T.com services. Even after the recent   market correction, T.com, better known as Thames Water, still has a market   valuation below that of Freeserve. At the widest point between the old and new   economies, Freeserve was worth four times as much.   The reason the Citibank calculation is nonsense is simple, but fundamental.   The margins Citibank makes on its forex business vary widely. If you buy   small quantities of notes from a bank, the spread is much wider than 1 per   cent. If you are a large corporation trading major currencies, the margin is   wafer thin. Entry and competition force prices down to the related costs.   In Mr Gibbs's model, Freeserve earns profits of o2bn, about equal to the   current profits of Tesco, J. Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer together. And it   earns these on revenues of only o2.5bn, so that profits are 80 per cent of the   value of its sales. No established business earns margins of that size.   Thames Water is one of a tiny number of companies whose market position is   so strong, whose output is so necessary to life, that if it charged five times the   current price we would have little choice but to pay. We do have one option -   to insist the government intervenes. It confines Thames Water to a return on   its capital employed of about 6 per cent.   The idea that profit is a return on capital invested still has some role in new   economy valuation, at the level of the overall market.   There is a key formula in the new math. The required yield on a security is   equal to the difference between the rate of return demanded from that class of   securities and its expected rate of growth. So, if you expect a return of 5.5 per   cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per cent, calculations show   that the dividend yield should be 0.5 per cent.   This is the calculation done by James Glassman and Kevin Hassett in their   book Dow 36,000*. Claiming that sustainable dividends average half of   earnings, this yield equates to a price/earnings ratio of 1000 - implying a target   of 36,000 for the US index.   The trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to produce what the   investor is looking for. Investors will receive only two-fifths of the cash   sustaining the valuation this century. One-third of the total depends on   dividend cheques that will arrive after 222000.   Two hundred years ago, well before the Dow Jones average, prudent,   diversified investors would have owned slave traders and sugar plantations, or   perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new economy -a canal.   The next 2000 years may be more stable than the last and Microsoft and Cisco   may prove more enduring than plantations. But we can hardly be sure.   While 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the growth rate of   dividends in the US economy as a whole, it is likely that well before 222000   most of these will come from companies not yet founded.   Suppose we accept Glassman and Hassett's protests that their dividend   growth expectations are conservative. If you raise them only from 5 per cent to   5.25 per cent, the anticipated value of the Dow Jones average is 72,000. At   5.5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares of US companies   are infinitely valuable. Not even the most credulous dotcom investor believes   that.   The math also works in reverse. If expectations of return are 6 per cent rather   than 5.5 per cent, the market p/e ratio falls to 50 and the value of the Dow   Jones from 36,000 to 18,000. And if equity investors require a return of 8 per   cent, you would have to conclude that shares are worth only half their current   level.   An 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for an equity investor. A   day trader might think you were talking about a weekly profit rather than   annual. Glassman and Hassett use a figure as low as 5.5 per cent - the return   on Treasury bonds - because they argue that equities have so consistently   outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated with equity   investment. In other words, because equities are sure to offer higher returns   than bonds, the expected yield on equities should be the same as on bonds.   You do not have to be Wittgenstein to spot the flaw. The rules of logic hold   even in cyberspace, and so do the principles of economics. Profits are hard to   earn in competitive businesses, and markets that are not competitive are   usually regulated. The value of companies ultimately depends on their   capacity to generate cash for shareholders. Distant returns are uncertain.   Share prices are volatile, and investors need to be compensated for the risks.   These truths are as valid in the new economy as the old.   By all means do the math. Isaac Newton, who could do the math better than   most, gave up an annuity of o650 per year to invest in the South Sea Bubble.   In addition to the math, you need the econ, the pol, and perhaps the   psychology.   * Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the   Stock Market, James K. Glassman &amp; Kevin A. Hassett, Random House,   1999.   The author a director of London Economics.   Copyright , The Financial Times Limited \n"

Unfortunately I'll be in Milwaukee visiting Harley-Davidsonabout a book revision project both Thursday and Friday.   How about earlynext week.   I appreciate your patience with me.   When you suggested a timelast week I was \"unprepared\" and embarassed to call and expose myignorance.   Since then I have re-read the Enron Gas Services case and havea pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financialsides of the business.   The other theme that I have heard many Enronspeakers use is the \"de-regulation\" of markets.   This certainly played afactor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business.If you'll let me know when it's convenient to call next week I'll have somenotes put together.   I'm teaching a class for a colleague on Monday soanytime after that is great.Thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip.Johnp.s.   I saw that the Univ of New Orleans has an Energy Finance endowedchair for a financial economist open.

I really enjoyed our discussions, both at thetechnical level and otherwise.I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates fora visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule wasclearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule -mine is rather terrible:Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is EasterSunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enronto be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing tovisit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be inJapan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probablyis too far out. The main problem is that I am operating withina window of opportunity for attracting top students for thisresearch. This window closes by the end of April, and it would beimportant for the student support funds to be in place then, sothat I can make hard commitments to students and attract toptalent. I am already reviewing files of students who haveapproached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing \"softcommitments to star-level students\" to get this research and itspotential on their radar screen. Top students are highly soughtafter by advisors and I want to be an early player in thiscompetition.Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up theproject and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before theend of April is important for getting top people. If the visit canhappen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project getsgoing. Please let me know what you think.Best Regards,Nick\n"

No chief information officer or network\rmanager wants to have to tell the CEO that their e-commerce site has\rbeen broken into and customer credit card data copied. Stories like that\rtend to stick in a potential customer=01,s mind more than an expensive\rSuper Bowl ad.\r It=01,s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies, never mind\rlatest security patch for your operating system or e-commerce\rapplication. But we=01,re here to help.\r Once a week we=01,ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the\rmajor vendors and security organizations with links to the source.

Tom is a Corporate Relations Officerat Wharton.Recommendation.I am writing to you to recommend joining The Wharton Partnership.The Partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinateWharton School initiatives for industry-academic cooperation. Currently,the partnership supports alliances with approximately   2000 companies worldwide.The recommended annual contribution by Enron is between $1000K-150K,that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as GE, Citigroup,Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., Intel, and many others.   The contribution is executed throughgrants to different research projects that would directly benefit Enron. The choiceof the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over timedepending on the business needs.Benefits to Enron. Enron can benefit from the Partnership by: - gaining advance access to current academic research   - significantly increasing our presence   and visibility on the campus,   enhancing   our recruiting efforts - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant   influence on public opinion   - gaining access to high quality executive education programsSpecific Programs.The Partnership functions through involvement in different research projects. I haveidentified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to Enron.1. WeBI (Wharton e-Business Initiative). This programs provides an umbrella   for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research and   corporate engagement related to e-commerce.   Main benefits: access to e-commerce research and   enhanced recruitment opportunities.2. Emerging Technologies Management Research Program. Interdisciplinary   program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing intellectual   property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal   organizational structures.   Benefits to Enron: access to financial technology in the area of valuation of   intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.3. Risk Management and Decision Process Center. Development of techniques for   assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the scope   of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments).   Benefits to Enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination   of information about our capabilities in this area.Potential users of the program at Enron.My group could coordinate the cooperation with the Risk Management and Decision Process Center.Greg Whalley is a potential customer for WeBI. Several different units of Enron can be involved with   Emerging Technologies Management Research Program.Vince\n"

This week we=01,ve got a report on how to\rprevent those nasty denial-of-service attacks,   a look at the SunTone\rCertified Services for Service Providers program, and a Network World\rwhite paper on network storage issues.\r Arrowpoint Communications\rWeb Site Security and Denial of Service Protection\r Preventing a denial-of-service (DOS) attack is critical for most Web\rsites. These attacks are specifically designed to bring down a Web site\rusing methods that appear to be normal network traffic   until it is\rtoo late. Web site administrators have used packet filtering in their\rIP routers to provide basic access control, but often this slows router\rperformance to an unacceptable point and fails to eliminate many common\rtypes of DOS attacks. Furthermore, traditional firewalls were designed\rto prevent access to systems, a concept that is incompatible with\rtoday=01,s Web.\r With that in mind, Arrowpoint presents its case for Content Smart Web\rSwitches that provide comprehensive Web site and back-end system\rsecurity capabilities, as well as the right level of security, without\rsacrificing scalability or performance. The paper looks at the switches\rand how they can help prevent the DOS attacks.\rhttp:///nww1.com/go/wp06222000_arrowpoint.html\r   Sun Microsystems\rSunTone Certified Services for Service Providers\r With the explosion of service providers offering Internet services, Sun\rcreated the SunTone certification and logo program to recognize and\rpromote investments in process, methodology and infrastructure\relements that promote secure, reliable and predictable Internet\rservices.\r This white paper explains the program, shows its objectives, highlights\rthe certification process and gives an example of a sample certified\rarchitecture.\rhttp:///nww1.com/go/wp06222000_suntone.html\r   Network World white paper\rMaking the Storage Connection\r The rising tide of data storage has hit a critical point. Learn more\rabout the latest network storage solutions by reading case studies of\rcompanies that are tackling the issue. Included is a discussion of\rwhether to outsource your storage, and a glossary of storage networking\rterms.\r This white paper was produced by Network World in association with\r3Ware, Computer Associates, Exabyte, Interphase, St. Bernard Software,\rStorage Networks and W. Quinn.\r Note: White paper is in PDF format, you=01,ll need Adobe Acrobat Reader to\raccess the file:\r Link for white paper:\rhttp:///nww1.com/go/wp06222000_storage.html\rLink for Adobe Acrobat:\rhttp:///www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html   As always, you can find all of our white papers at the Vendor White\rPaper area of Network World Fusion.

What used to be a nascent market has expanded from\raddressing niche enterprise needs to providing significant IT support\rfor many Fortune 5000 companies.\r However, there are still significant impediments to wide acceptance of\rapplications outsourcing.   Two major deterrents have to do with older\rbusiness concerns.\r One significant problem that has been addressed only tangentially by\rASPs is the fact that corporate IT departments are, more often that not,\rdependent on less than cutting edge technologies.   Many established\rcompanies have, over the years, made significant investments in legacy\rtechnologies.   The fury over Y2K attests to the high number of mainframe\rcomputers still using first-generation code.   Such organizations may\rhave added a great deal of newer technology, but concerns over the older\rapplications may be preventing them from taking advantage of application\rhosting.   Even if there were an ASP willing to address the entire\rsolution, including legacy systems, doubt about the viability of handing\roff archaic yet mission-essential systems may prevent an enterprise from\rhanding over support of these applications.   While the ASP may offer a\rmore cost-effective solution, the fear is that it may not be able to\roffer the depth of experience necessary to work with older technology.\r Security is the second dynamic that tends to retard ASP acceptance.\rAlthough most ASPs are able to maintain the proper level of security\rnecessary for critical information, many IT departments find the idea of\rputting that information in the hands of a third party too daunting.\rThere are some businesses with huge IT investments that absolutely\rcannot take chances with information leakage.   Local telephone service\rproviders, because of their Federal Communication Commission regulators,\rcome to mind.\r A simple pitch of cost avoidance or cost reduction is rarely sufficient\rto sway IT mangers in such organizations.   They are thinking about the\rcare and feeding of cranky old mainframes that run a million lines of\rCOBOL and manage highly proprietary customer information.   Only when\rASPs are willing to spend the time to understand the needs of such a\rcomplex IT environment will they truly be able to introduce services\rfully capable of addressing all the security and legacy issues involved.\r Until such an enlightened ASP comes along, there are still several ways\rto start moving to outsourcing for IT managers coping with a legacy or\rhighly sensitive environment.   First, consider whether a full\routsourcing solution is the only option.   It may be that there=01,s a\rsubset of the IT architecture that is appropriate for an ASP to take on.\rIt may also be possible to find an ASP to partner with and gradually\rmigrate support of legacy systems as the ASP learns the systems and\rtheir requirements.\r One thing is certain: legacy systems are not going away anytime soon.\rIt=01,s also just as certain that application service provision is the way\rof the future.   ASPs let enterprises offload an expensive and time-\rconsuming technical function.\r As the ASP market matures, this column will examine issues such as these\rfrom both the user and the vendor perspectives.

In the year since, we have a number of copycats and variants\rof Melissa invading our e-mail systems, though not to the same extent.\r Now, the e-mail virus du jour is the \"South Park\" virus, named after\rthe animated series on Comedy Central. The South Park virus, known in\rsecurity circles as W32/Pretty.worm.unp, attempts to send itself to all\rthe addresses listed in an infected user's Outlook address book every\rthirty minutes. By doing so, the virus causes an \"e-mail storm\" that\rcan bog down and crash network servers attempting to relay the flurry\rof mail. South Park appears to come from a known user and contains an\ricon featuring Kenny, one of the characters from the show.\r Security software maker Finjan Software has reported seven variants of\rthe South Park virus, which itself is a variant of the PrettyPark virus\rthat made the rounds a few weeks earlier.\r For more information on South Park and its variants:\rhttp:///www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0306southpark.html http:///www.finjan.com/attack_release_detail.cfm?attack_release_id=3D32\r   Before we get to the latest alerts, two other resources to check out:\r 1. The Shmoo Group, a security consultancy, has written a paper entitled\r\"How to Write Secure Code.\" It can be found at:\rhttp:///www.shmoo.com/securecode/   2. Eric Knight of Security Paradigm has written an online book entitled\r\"Computer Vulnerabilities.\" The book looks into how hackers exploit\rvulnerabilities and what methods they use. Knight's book is available in\rPDF format at:\rhttp:///www.securityparadigm.com/compvuln_draft.pdf\r   Now on with the latest alerts and patches:\r   W97M/Melissa.AO virus\r Computer Associates is reporting a new version of the Melissa\rmacrovirus that could be making the rounds. This one disables the\rTools/Macro command bar, Virus Protection, SaveNormalPrompt and\rConfirmConversions options in Microsoft Word. It also makes a couple of\rchanges to the Windows registry. Like the original Melissa, this\rversion replicates itself to the first 25 users in the Outlook address\rbook.\rhttp:///www.ca.com/virusinfo/ ***\r Microsoft had a busy week, releasing three patches covering a variety\rof problems:\r 1. Patch available for \"Registry Permissions\" vulnerability.\r It seems as if the security on a couple of registry settings in Windows\rNT 4.0 is not as secure as the Redmonians first thought. This patch\rfixes the problem, which could let a malicious user gain additional\rprivileges on a system they are logged into.\rhttp:///www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq000-0008.asp\r 2. Patch available for \"SQL Query Abuse\" vulnerability.\r This patch for Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and Microsoft Data Engine 1.0\rplugs a hole that could enable a remote user to author malicious SQL\rqueries that allow the user to take unauthorized actions against on the\rdatabase or underlying operating system.\rhttp:///www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq000-014.asp\r 3. Patch available for \"Clip Art Buffer Overrun\" vulnerability.\r A feature in Microsoft Office that lets users download and install clip\rart from the \"Microsoft Clip Art Gallery\" has a potential hole. Using a\rvery long embedded field in the clip art files, a malicious user could\rcrash or even execute code on the system where the clip art file is\rdownloaded.\rhttp:///www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq000-015.asp\r***\r Red Hat releases nmh packages\r Following up a vulnerability that was reported here last week, Red Hat\rhas released new nmh packages. A vulnerability in the previous nmh\rreleases allowed specially formed MIME headers to execute code using\rnmh's 'mhshow' utility.\rhttp:///bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D99921\r***\r Network file resource vulnerability\r Eric Hacker of Lucent=01,s NetworkCare division is reporting that\rapplications running in Windows could provide remote access to user name\rand password information. Hacker warns that programs such as Internet\rExplorer, Eudora, Word and Outlook running on default configurations of\rWindows can be duped into sending a user name and password information\rto unsuspecting users. Though this information may be encrypted, it is\reasily crackable, Hacker reports.\rFor more information:\rWindows 95:\rhttp:///support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q165/4/03.ASP NT 4.0:\rhttp:///support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q147/7/06.asp Win2000:\rhttp:///support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q239/8/69.ASP ***\r Password problem in SBC DSL routers\r A Kewlhair Security advisory reports that routers being used in SBC\rCommunications' digital subscriber line service are being installed\rwithout a password. Kewlhair reports that engineers are failing to set\rthe passwords during installation at customer sites. SBC is using\rCayman DSL routers.\rFor more information on how to set the password:\rhttp:///cayman.com/security.html#passwordprotect ***\r Astar application vulnerability\r TESO, \"crew of coders and freaks who care mostly about network and Unix\rsecurity,\" are reporting a hole in the astar application that ships with\rthe Halloween 4 Linux distribution. Malicious users could use the\rapplication along with obscure command-line code to gain root access.\rVendor Web site:\rhttp:///www.halloween-linux.de/\r***\r Vulnerability in StarScheduler\r S.A.F.E.R. is reporting a vulnerability in StarScheduler, the groupware\rserver that comes with Sun=01,s StarOffice product. The underlying Web\rserver used by StarScheduler is vulnerable to remote execution of code\rand root access, according to the S.A.F.E.R. advisory.

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 12/17/999 03:08 PM ---VKaminski@aol.com on 12/12/999 111:41:09 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: (no subject) W ASHINGTON --- Joseph E. Stiglitz said Wednesday that he would   resign as the World Bank's chief economist after using the position   for nearly three years to raise pointed questions about the   effectiveness of conventional approaches to helping poor countries.   Stiglitz, who joined the World Bank in February 19997 after serving   as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers,   said he would leave the bank at the end of the year and would soon   return to his academic post at Stanford University.   His departure will remove from Washington perhaps the most   outspoken voice in the debate over how rich countries can best aid   economic development in poor and crisis-afflicted nations. Over the   last two years in particular, Stiglitz had antagonized officials at   the International Monetary Fund and within the Clinton   administration by criticizing their response to the financial   crisis in Asia and their strategy for encouraging the development   of democratic capitalism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet   Union.   Stiglitz said the decision to leave had been his. Treasury   Secretary Lawrence Summers praised Stiglitz as a \"major creative   and intellectual force,\" and administration officials said the   United States had not sought Stiglitz's removal. Caroline Anstey, a   spokeswoman for the World Bank, said Stiglitz had \"absolutely not\"   been forced out, and the bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn,   praised Stiglitz for having helped to move the institution \"away   from the so-called Washington consensus.\"   But Wolfensohn has suggested in the past that Stiglitz was too   quick to second-guess the international aid agencies and the big   industrial nations that control them. \"I think that his recent   things about Russia, in my judgment, are not wholly correct,\"   Wolfensohn said during the bank's annual meeting this autumn. \"I   think to stand back later and say, 'If you'd done it my way   everything would have been different,' is a little generous to   yourself.\"   Stiglitz made no secret Wednesday of feeling constrained in his   ability to speak out as freely as he wished. He said he was looking   forward to the unfettered freedom of expression afforded by his   return to the academic world.   \"Whenever you're in an organization there are some pressures,\"   Stiglitz said in an interview. \"I felt that it was important for my   intellectual integrity to be able to express myself as forcefully   as I thought was appropriate.\"   A liberal with a strong belief that governments and institutions   have a significant role to play in economic development and that   market forces cannot be counted on to deal with every problem,   Stiglitz challenged the prevailing orthodoxy among policy makers in   Washington.   He said that the monetary fund went overboard in Asia in demanding   that the countries ensnared in the financial crisis cut their   budgets, arguing that fiscal austerity sometimes extracted too high   a price from poor people without generating a corresponding   improvement in international economic confidence.   He took issue with the view held by the fund and the U.S.   government that controls on the international flow of capital were   counterproductive or impractical, saying that in some cases it was   justified to restrict short-term flows of money in and out of a   developing economy. He said industrialized countries sometimes   pushed developing nations too fast to deregulate their financial   systems.   He suggested that the United States and the monetary fund had   failed to acknowledge that their prescription for Russia --- quick   privatization of state-owned industries, an end to state oversight   of the economy, abolition of price controls and an opening up to   the rest of the world --- had not produced the intended results and   indeed had left many people worse off.   \"Stiglitz has been a very strong advocate for the poor and the   excluded, and he's been one of the best things in the World Bank in   the last decade,\" said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam, which   promotes poverty-fighting policies. \"He's also been very pointed   and insightful in discussing the role of the IMF. We're not used to   that kind of candor.\"   Stiglitz won few friends among economists and policy makers at the   Treasury Department and the monetary fund. But his message was   greeted enthusiastically in poor countries, and he said he was   leaving the bank feeling that he had helped to stimulate a more   vigorous debate about the policy prescriptions that wealthy nations   impose on developing countries.   \"On some of the specific issues, there has emerged really a broad   consensus behind the views I took,\" Stiglitz said.   \"There's a recognition that policies in East Asia were excessively   contractionary on the fiscal side,\" he continued. \"There's a   recognition that capital market liberalization, in the absence of   adequate regulatory structures, exposes countries to much higher   risks. And on the debate about economies in transition, there's a   general consensus that the issues I've been raising are the right   issues, and that while no one has the answers, we're not going to   get answers until we're willing to ask the questions.\"   Stiglitz had told friends recently that he intended to leave, and   he informed Wolfensohn Wednesday morning of his decision.   Wolfensohn said Stiglitz would continue to act as an adviser to him   and Stiglitz would lead the search for a new chief economist.   Ms. Anstey, the bank's spokeswoman, said that asking Stiglitz to   head the search committee was a signal of the institution's   \"intention to select someone who will continue the   Wolfensohn-Stiglitz agenda\" of focusing more on the needs of poor   countries and less on more orthodox policies developed in   Washington.   Stiglitz said his approach was built around two basic themes:   giving more of a voice to poor nations in setting policy and   recognizing the crucial role that government must play in economic   development.   \"We are rebalancing our thinking about the role of the state,\"   Stiglitz said. \"Some of the failures, like in East Asia, involve   cases where government did too little, like in financial   regulation, rather than too much.\"\n"

        " Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 01/20/2000 08:34 AM ---Clayton Vernon@ENRON01/20/2000 08:29 AMTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Stinson Gibner/HOU/ECT@ECT, zlu/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: auctions with an incumbent's right of first refusalVince-Here is an essay on the issue you are discussing:The Adverse Economic Impact of \"Rights of First Refusal\"An option to \"first refuse\" to match a competitor's offer is a restraint of free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace. This economic conclusion is unambiguous.If an \"incumbent\" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the full value of the item up for auction.   This is the efficient result in a market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources freely allocated to the high bidder.   If the auction has open bids, we can again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the second-highest valuation.Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the top bid from a competitor.Simply put, the incumbent with a \"right of first refusal\" can be safely predicted to simply match their competitor's bid by \"rule of thumb.\" But the incumbent's valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and administrative expenses.   And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted along with the bid.Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the \"Winner's Curse,\" a bidder realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match it, he almost certainly overbid.Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may just \"fire off\" a \"low-ball\" bid.   After all, in almost every conceivable \"state of the world\" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose money.   So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its most efficient use.\n"

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with a numerical estimate of thevalue of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences:he has something   of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of the value of this optioncould help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific; so we shall rather produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.Vince Kaminski---"

We can detect \"hoarding\" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against the actual inflow.2. We can detect \"market power\" by dissociating the seller from the buyer, distinguishing between the physical \"cost\" in gas to run the generators and the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.3. (As you noted) We can detect \"storage\" as the difference between inflow and consumption.It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors: hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.   We can \"calibrate\" the price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding, from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.   What the basis trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.   Finally, flows are \"explained\" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of the weather.I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a model.Clayton\n"

Apart from clarifying the timeliness, or lack thereof, of the published state-specific wellhead production estimates, he indicates their scientists find severe weather in the fields (freezes, hurricanes) to be a far more significant issue in production, and in wellhead prices, than is severe weather in the Northeast, for instance. Also, he agrees with you as to there being strictly increasing marginal costs in production, there being a rich texture of wells in terms of their efficiency, technologies, maintenance and investment issues.Clayton\n"

Unlike a person who is permamently located inHouston, I would have the inconvenience and cost of commuting between Austinand Houston, and of accomodation both in Austin and Houston.I really would love to work in the Research Group and am sincere about this.I would just hope that you would consider compensating me at manager levelso that I can cover transportation, accomodation expenses and moreimportantly, justify the decision to devote at least half of my time toEnron away from my thesis.I will be looking forward to hearing from you soon.Best,Cantekin DincerlerDoctoral CandidateThe University of Texas at AustinGraduate School of BusinessDepartment of Financeoffice: (512) 471-1676fax   : (512) 471-5073home   : (512) 472-5356cell   : (512) 680-53555http:///uts.cc.utexas.edu/~cantekin\n"

Is there someone at Enron who would be interested in speaking to ourMBAs about real options? Jim Dyer from our management science group isinterested in having someone for his decision analysis class this spring.Also, I am thinking about having a panel discussion in the Fall onvaluation issues.2. I recently received a phone call from the editor of the Journal ofApplied Corporate Finance, which is a practioner journal sponsored by theBank of America and Stern Stewart which is distributed to academics andmajor corporations.   They are doing a special issue on Energy and areinterested in an article on how energy derivatives are used for riskmanagement.   Are you aware of anyone from Enron who has written such anarticle?3. Last fall when you visited us at UT we discussed the possibility ofgiving lectures to Enron employees on valuation.   Ehud and I sent you aproposal but didn't get a response.   Is there still an interest in this.4. Murray Carlson and I are developing a general equilibrium model that wethink is potentially useful for valuing oil and gas derivatives as well asreal investments.   If you think this approach might be potentially usefulfor Enron, we would be interested in presenting our model to your researchgroup.I look forward to hearing from you soon.Best regards,SheridanSheridan TitmanDepartment of FinanceCollege of Business AdministrationUniversity of TexasAustin, Texas 78712-11179512-232-2787 (phone)512-471-5073 (fax)titman@mail.utexas.edu\n"

Indian papers and politicians are complaining about the high prices for power that the state govt. in Maharastra is paying to Enron. The reason: Naphtha prices more than doubled in 1999 and the fuel cost is a pass through (I can't believe they let it floating!). They requested our help in pricing caps on naphtha.Krishna.---",

I calculated the premiums for monthly caps for different cap (strike) levels using the 1999 prices as forward prices. The scenarios I included are:1. At-the-money (ATM) caps: cap level = forward price (FP)2. Out-of-the-money (OTM) caps: cap level = (1+x) * FP where x = 5%, 10%, 15% &amp; 20%3. Constant cap level across months: $168 (average of FPs), $2000, and $250.Brief results: Historical naptha volatility is 34% over last 2-years (which is higher than over the 10-year period - see the volatility chart). Premiums expressed as percent of the average naptha price for 2000:   ATM =   10.4%   ATM*=   13% (Assumiung FP = $2224/MT)   5%   OTM = 8.4%   10% OTM = 6.8%   15% OTM = 5.5%   20% OTM =   4.4%   $168 Cap   = 15%   $2000 Cap   = 9%   $2225 Cap   = 6%. If you are looking to protect from any price move up from the current level, you will be looking at 10-15% range. Please keep in mind these are only indicative, since we are just guessing the forward prices. Given such drastic changes in prices during the last year, we really need to get an indication of the forward prices. I made some inquiries here and found the name of the person trading naptha. It is John L Chismar in Singapore ( Ph.0111-65-838-9016; email: jchisma@ect.enron.com). Please contact him today and try to get an indication of the forward prices and volatilities for 2000.   It would be much easier if we can install our Exotic Options Library in your office. We need to place it in a common drive that all of you can access. If any of the common drives you use is G, J, M, O, or P, I can send you the files to be installed. If your common drive has another initial, we need to do some programming here before sending to you.   Call me to discuss/clarify further. You can call me at home if necessary (home ph. 281-240-5705; I am awake till 111PM usually). best wishes,Krishna. \tAnshuman Srivastav @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \t12/09/999 09:05:49 AM To: Pinnamaneni Krishnarao@ECTcc: Rajesh Sivaraman/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Sandeep Kohli/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Historical Naphtha Prices - 1987-1999Hi Mr.Krishnarao,Was really nice talking to you!
