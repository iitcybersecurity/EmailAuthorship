Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ENA target.   In order to stay flat year on year, I split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.   As we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you.   All outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.   I look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks.Wes, can you please   finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes.RegardsDelainey\n"

If you=\r=20\rhave not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20\rregard this session as different from any working session you have previous=\rly=20\rexperienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven=\r=20\rto be very successful.   Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20\rmethodology on this very critical and strategic venture.\r A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.   You were=\r=20\rselected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=\re=20\rDesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=\r=20\rlittle distraction or interruption as possible.   The quality of our results=\r=20\rdepends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=\r=20\rentire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=\rt=20\rand communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =\r=20\rThis date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=\ro=20\rthat your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20\rnecessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=\r=20\rthese two days.\r Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=\r=20\rand transportation.   Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=\r=20\rhas also been included.

There will be approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting.   All have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron entities:   Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron Energy Services.   Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business).   Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.   You are scheduled to address the group as follows:Date:   Tuesday, October 24, 2000Time:   8:30 am   (breakfast will be served at 8:000 and you are invited to join us)Place:   The Warwick Hotel   The Versailles Room - 12th Floor   5701 Main Street   Houston,   TX   7770005The group would like to hear about Enron's performance, your outlook for the remainder of 2000 and into 20001, your viewpoint on the future of the company and next growth opportunities, etc.   With a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do so).   Q&amp;A afterwards would be great.   Key speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this group would be:recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 2000 the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure integrity in mid and back office functionsthe importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for Enron (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to \"raise the flag\" on issues if needed   \n"

We became involved in recruiting there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.   OU transformed their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management Program in the School of Business.   This undergraduate degree retains the geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course.   With the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around \"energy\" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.   Our recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy Management graduates have done well at Enron.   Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody Crook.   He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 graduation.   His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book administrator in gas trading.   He is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team.   In addition to this last year's risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for Burlington Resources.   I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.   I think very highly of him, and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program.   His background and your business seem to be a good fit.   Please visit with Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.   It will be well worth your time.   Thanks.   \n"

Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I would, but I am not the techie!!!   We had dinner there one night while in Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty -   a lot better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.   Our friends the Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.   It looks pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!!Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air.   Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.   I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.   Hope all is well with the three of you.   Are you making the trip to Halletsville on Saturday, assuming no rain out?   I am not going to make it - need a little r&amp;r at home and to wash some clothes!!!   Love, Sally \n"

The current trading staff for EBS will report to Barry effective with his start date in May.

I also have any materials that you may have provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.   With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of your resume.   The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance specifically from January through June 2000.   However, it would be helpful to me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.   Please e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.   A couple of you have come by my office to meet with me.   I would also be happy to put a name and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in Houston.

Thanks to Patti, who scoped out options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option, we   have some good seats for the year.   The new tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, about 28 rows up from the field.   Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last year!   We will work on the aisle for next   year.   We also still have the two Terrace level tickets as we did last year.   For some games you will get all 6 tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace tickets.   Not a bad start to the season so far, so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is history!   ---Sally \n"

You can use these tickets for yourself and for a small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.   The parking information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.   Patti is including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.   Your tickets will be distributed to you this week.   I hope that you and your staff will enjoy these.   I also received over 1000 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.   I have chosen to distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy Operations who are not my direct reports.

      "body": "\nI got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon.   Thought I would do a quick note to bring you up to date on some things. Commercialization Efforts- Services:   Delayed by several days due to the unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.   I learned about this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her as best we can during this market sizing phase.   Jennifer Denney (who was in Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down additional data on potential customers.   Beth Apollo will be working closely with James and Jennifer.   They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.   Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:   Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for providing risk consulting services to external customers.   Some of his ideas overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas meeting.   Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk operations team.   I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.   Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting company.   Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.   There could be a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us - we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding work - not necessarily a bad model.   Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting and is ready to pay.   Probably okay for him to start this effort in that way.   Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with someone else.   I spent some time with him today.   I want to be sure that he doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and being in agreement with the fee structure.   We are okay for right now.   I will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together if there is a good upside.   I will keep you posted.   Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:   We have to change some business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are selling operational services to their customers.   We must price those and we must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.   Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be sufficient to cover our costs.   We are researching.   To do's here are to create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.   I met with Louise today on this.   I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week of March 19.   Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig teams.   I will get you a draft for your comments. Operational Risk:   Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in Portland.   Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.   I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.   (We lost the manager of that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an Enron job there.   Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday of another risk book administrator from Portland.) Operational Risk:   Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.   End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.   We are working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues with customers after the sale effective date.   We expect to eliminate 46 positions with the sale.   This number was much larger earlier in the year (around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.   Bob Hall is focused on the details around this issue.   Operational Risk:   We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office last week.   (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.)   Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the end.   I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of these reviews.   We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.   He likes the revisions that we have made.   Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.   Spring Break Plans:   My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and the nanny has the week off.   We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.   Patti has contact numbers for me if needed.   I may decide to come back into the office on Thursday and Friday.   I will let Patti know when we get back in town.   I will either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.   See separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out.   \n"

Please note that this is a meeting organized by the IT community, notthe user community.As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in order to provide the IT groupwith an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority projects.   However, the arrival ofEOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those priority projects.   Today, the deal clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such as ClickPaper.com, CommodityLogic, project Thunderball   and a new weather capture and confirmation system.   This has created some internal conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications group is requesting that their projects be set as the top priority project.   This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user community and the IT group supportingthis group.   I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either the meeting or these challenges. ---",

We have over 3000 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.   We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide \"coaching\" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.   It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.   The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.   \n"

Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.   In conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily report from Ted on component V@R.   Ted called me about 3:000 pm today (Houston time) to let me know about this requirement.   Obviously, we want to meet Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and   complete as possible.   Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be excluded from the first run of component V@R.   (Mike:   I assume that you are very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send to the daily 8:30 meeting.)   I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh and me at 4:000 today.   Realizing that the time was very late in London, we tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in the meeting.   Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.   Here is the key fact to know:   It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.   The Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by approximately 10:000 am Houston time.   Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:000 am Houston time (10:000 am London time).   If this time frame is not met, then component V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.   We had hoped to discuss this with you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:000 am London requirement for officialized books.   The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.   Those V@R calculations that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the component V@R calculations.   While there are other commodities that will currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less material than the UK spread options.   Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of days before this is completed.   Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.   I should note that the firm 10:000 am deadline for officializing books in the UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:000 am Houston time.   We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.   It is probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report earlier in the morning.   Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently meeting the 10:000 am deadline in London.   \n"

      "body": "\nIn a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that team.   From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic has been limited.   The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through CommodityLogic.   I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in conversations around CommodityLogic. Staffing Contributions CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):   Carrie Slagle, Manager CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):   Susan Harrison, Manager CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)   Mary Solmonson, Senior Director CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):   Molly Sumrow, Specialist User Requirement and Testing Staff:   Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations) ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.   Both had worked in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.   Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles where they were charged with managing large teams of people.   But knowing both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the operations team who know a lot about the business.   Both have proven in the past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense --- providing gas operations experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most appropriately .   Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very quickly.   One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a scheduler on our gas team (Molly).   Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.   NomLogic was already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.   We started the project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to EOL transactions.   We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.   Tom looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently renamed it NomLogic.   Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange project team, and we transfered her along with the project to CommodityLogic.   Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.   It is input from my group that has created the modules by defining user requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.   I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's participation as a good way to leverage my time.   Previously, she was a senior director managing our Global Databases group.   With an IT development background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on CommodityLogic.   Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her involvement going forward.   During the five months that she was assigned to CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.   Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable operations professionals to be part of the   CommodityLogic team - Leslie Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging products.   They were part of the   CommodityLogic team in the early days, and both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their replacements on CommodityLogic.   \n"

Wanted to know if you would be interested in that.   Told her that I couldn't speak for you.   I'd suggest that you contact her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first interest.   Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time with her.   You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know more and she will know you.   FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate.   ---Sally \n"

      "body": "\nCharlene:   Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our meeting on Wednesday morning.   I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.   Background:   As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner.   Our intent is continued support and improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included the following: Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU Brent Price   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT   Jeff Sommers   CALME   Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida Ed Coats   Corp. Tax   Core Team Member - UT, A&amp;M, LSU and University of Florida Sally Beck   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU Carolyn Barrett   EBS   Howard Selzer   Enron Global E&amp;P Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:One program, or two:   Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an announcement   was made that there would be one analyst program.   Not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed.   In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.   We feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus. SIngle start date:   The single start date of July 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an innovative company.   The July start date does not consider December graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in May.   Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or communication about the program.   We hear rumors of \"tracks\", but no facts or details.   Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some had not.   Commercial focus too heavy:   Presentation materials, the attitudes of support staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.Lack of input from biggest supporters:   Given the time and effort that many of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that decisions (example:   the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us.   MSAP has taken a step backward:   Previously, with a dedicated leadership team and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program.   We feel that the focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.   Summary Concerns/Discussion Points:Disc   \n"

Our primary need is just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.Colorado Springs Utilities   10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWsBPA   10/1/01-12/31/05 NW Delivered 105 MWsWelded Tube   1/1/98-6/30/05 PGE - NW 5.2-12MWsBritish Columbia Power Exchange 1/1/98-1/1/15 COB 85-176 MWsHarbor CogenThank you for your help, Sally,Ken\n"

      "subject": "Doorstep Review Process",
      "forwarded": [],
      "body": "\nDoorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 20001.)   The controls around mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test - i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.   Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of explaining what we think happens.   Doing a deal test tells us what does happen.   And it is when there are differences between the controls that we believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.   As such, they are purposely designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to produce less paperwork.   It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that are valuable in these reviews.   These reviews also look   for ways to leverage success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class practices or practical solutions to shared problems.   Briefly, the doorstep review process would follow this set of steps: 1)   Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.   This is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town.   2)   Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in making information and personnel available to complete the review.   3)   The review is conducted, including information sessions with key commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.   The deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.   4)   The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those which may not be working as designed.   Potential action items are suggested.   This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support the growth of their business.   The doorstep team lets the head of the office know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing so.   5)   Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.   Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.   Ted and I, assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.   Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep findings and plans for the next quarter.   Through most of 2000, the doorstep teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each doorstep review.   This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me sometime late in 2000.   We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more timely manner than quarterly.   Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in Germany.   Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors in charge of the scrap metal business.   Her impression was that they were not concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's practices.   Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley was involved in that session as well.   At my suggestion, she also contacted Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.   I do not know what the timing was for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.   Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.   And if that was the case, I apologize for that.   While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.   If you would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.   In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona mentioned some concerns.   Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked for more detail.   She definitely covered both the teams findings and the integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.   We don't, however, control which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.   To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.   The effort here is to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire Enron organization.   The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, which I believe is healthy.   We purposefully have chosen not to \"over-wordsmith\" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be surfaced through these reviews.   Frankly, I believe that these reviews can reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.   I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with you.   We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.   Mike Jordan and certain members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other businesses outside EEL later in the year.   We are certainly open to any suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.\n"

As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.   I have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 20001 and to recommend any changes in timing and approach.   Beth is in fact in Monterrey, Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.   Soon after she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review schedule.   After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.   With Beth's knowledge of the businesses in London, I am sure we will benefit from her eye towards effective scheduling of the reviews.   \n"

This can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.   The morning on Monday will set the stage:   why we have gathered, endorsement of our efforts (Causey).   Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short \"state of the union of operations\" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and EEL).   Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.   Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could have such an impact.   Each table can report back as we gather to start the afternoon.   Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and lessons learned.   Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going project.   Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool for the operations controllers:   a website tailored for the group.   We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.   Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles Center Field Terrace.   Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.   Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.   He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.   He will make an informal presentation and then will entertain questions.   The rest of the morning will be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office services within Enron.   Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.   Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.   After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 20001 to check progess against our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).

If there is a need to address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road until Brenda returns.   Let me know. I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to go live in London within 5 days.   I am trying to find out if that is true.   If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.   We had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.   Not ideal.   I hope that history has not repeated itself.   Let me know if you have heard anything on this.   \n"

His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as will his leadership on the gas team.

Avril Forster from the Houston office will be providing the training.We will divide the training into three sessions on February 222nd   as follows:10:000 - 12:000 Origination team training1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 3:000 - 5:000 Trading team training All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).   Please make every effort to attend this training.   Hopefully, you will find the EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.   If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.\n"

Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the   underlying. They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the forward price of the underlying itself. We have engaged London based   IT and are looking at the code we have used in Power 999 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 1000% sure given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&amp;L number but what the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem (knowingly or not)   for years. What sign offs were gained for the implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that it is not for a lack of trying.Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.James\n"

      "body": "\nTO:   All EGM and EIM employees affectedFROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management OperationsLast fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.   All wholesale companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.   In that organizational memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality services to Enron wholesale customers.   This alignment also positions us to evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as well.   With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we wait until January 1, 20001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.   Senior management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to Enron Networks.   Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks did not get fully executed.   To correct this, effective April 01, 20001, all EGM and EIM   employees   and non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under   company 083E.   Starting April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping purposes.   This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' structure.There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.   This applies only to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,4000.000 for 20001.   Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does not start over but continues as usual.The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you on your 20001 tax return as withholding.   Therefore, to alleviate the burden of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.   Be sure to ask your tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.   You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-555 to assist you with any questions.   We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best practices that can positively impact all teams.   If you have questions, please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is dedicated:   Business Unit HR Contact Phone#EGM   David Hill 713/853-4218EIM Kathy Neal 713/345-7803EA/Global Services Frank De Jesus 713/345-36662EA/Global Services Hector McLoughlin 713/853-6703Thanks for your continued hard work and dedication to the success of Enron Wholesale Services.   \n"

Both Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.   I know that North America included US drift in its plan and includes \"drift earnings\" in its margin.   I believe you do the same in Europe.   Jeff is adamant that we not   move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has asked for UK drift to remain, as well.   You may want to call Jeff.   Sally and I will do what ever you guys decide.   ---Original Message---From:   Jeffrey A Shankman   Sent: Wednesday, February 28, 20001 2:15 PMTo: Wes ColwellCc: Sally BeckSubject: FW: Changes to the executive ViewerPlease deal with this.

John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed below.   In essence, John would like Enron Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.   If you agree to this change could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate changes.

The group was led by a director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 specialists.   The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday afternoon.   My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive in finding new assignments within Enron through the Enron Corp. Re-deployment Team.   Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the commercialization of mid and back office services.   As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities within my team.   I am committed to investing appropriately in people resources to support core activities.   And I believe that we can become even more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.   The role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the respective business sponsors/end users.   The \"middle-man\" role played by the Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.   I wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the re-deployment effort.   \n"

Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the capacity on the floor.   While these locations are not prime spots, people will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.   Once the window seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.   Susan Harrison is working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition period.   Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and equipment on the 30th floor.   If there are any problems once a move has occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.   If Chantelle is not available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.   Maria can be reached at Ext. 3-55586.I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the window spaces.   We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and supplies on the floor.   Please coordinate with your assistant to have your area cleaned up by December 31.   During this clean-up process, if you have any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a neat and professional work environment.   Between now and the summer of 20001 when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.   I would greatly appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available space effectively.If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.\n"

We have identified our target teams for due diligence efforts around commodities.   While each person on the list has other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted to projects as they arise.   I will review this list continually and update it as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent job as part of a due diligence team.   I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG acquisition.   We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this checklist so that all are prepared.   Let me know if you are interested in the names on my list.   Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence effort.   Dedicated Support Named for Transportation BusinessI met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the executive summary from the consulting team.   I followed up with Brent Price (my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an appropriate infrastructure to support that business.   Currently, Todd Hall and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.   Todd has other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time that Todd would have.   Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.   She will be returning to Houston from the London office by the end of March.   She will be able to split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.   Todd will stay involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.   We will also keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.   Shelley is expected to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week regarding our plans.   I will keep you posted. \n"

For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.   Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 20001.   Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 1000% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it. Kerry Roper (x5-4895)\n"

Since you said that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.

To date, I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types of information and format that he likes.   I will bring you a copy tomorrow and would like your input on content and format as well.   With the recent reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report.   After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can use the same format.   In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track compliance with our fundamental operating standards.   We are in the phase of determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations against the operating standards.   As we get this to a first draft stage, I will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.   ---Sally ---"

Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term \"protocol\" into these discussions.   To clarify, according to Anne, the \"protocol\" is not anticipated to be a formal legal document.   Instead, Anne envisions simply e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.   Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) to Steve Jackson (AEP).   Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally documented.   Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for gas to be delivered in the month of May.   He has worked with Enron's treasury group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's Treasury group for her review.   Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.   We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of you.   This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have to date captured the status of transition issues.   Items that only require actions by Enron will be our \"to do\" list.   Each item has a due date and we will update you weekly on progress.   Those items that fall under the AEP list or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.   I believe that this should satisfy your requests earlier this week for written \"protocol\".   We will also update you weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and AEP.   I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update on the HPL sale.   To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:   1)   Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and their status, or   2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a firsthand update to the two of you.   Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can incorporate that into our schedules for next week.   \n"

      "body": "\nWhile recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made at the Program level to not interview this fall for 20001 summer interns.   In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 20001 interns.   I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's staffing.   When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.   It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs.   I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with no resolution.   When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.   Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do so.   They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information.   I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 20001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall.   While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.   As administrators of the program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus.   I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system.   I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.   I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships.   In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns.   I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you. Please let me know how this can be resolved.   With the help of James Scribner and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships.   I will offer as much of my time as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative ways to turn this around.   \n"

I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but certainly felt as if I worked very hard --- shopping, wrapping, baking, volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 222nd (3 years old - not very good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!   I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of January 15.   I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through Thursday in the office there.   I have blocked those days on my calendar and Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.   How does that work with your schedule?   Will you be in the office that week and what is your schedule like?   I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if   you don't have some time available.   Let me know, and then we can firm up discussions topics and agendas.   (My thought on that particular week is that it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the office during the week of January 222 and thereafter to communicate bonus information.)   I am in the office all of this week.   ---Sally \n"

Much effort has been put forth in   \"cleansing\" the parent/subsidiary information presented in Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except for on an ad hoc, manual basis. What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading positions properly,   let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data population efforts. Your comments and ideas are welcome. Debbie\n"

I have given Sheila my feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank than I have had.   Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with Frank.   Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.

I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it done.   I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.   However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to make sure she has it in readable form?   I will be in London all of next week, and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and dinner.   I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.   I don't know whether or not you included that on your list.   Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!!   I wonder if that could be a problem on the 31st?   You never know with Houston weather.   What do you think?   We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned by Irma's son, Luis).   I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as well.   I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see at the end of January.   ---Sally \n"

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back in the office next week.   My first move will be to sit down with Jeff Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours that James Scribner sent you.   When we look at numbers of confirmations and compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed   to absorb increased business more easily.   I also think that Jeff will be the best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.   All of the advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for implementation.   No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.   ---"

That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be my guest that evening for dinner and the lecture.   I can't think of a better idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright, motivated women!

It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.   Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.   I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.   Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.   Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.   The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.   Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.   The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day   operations of EnronOnline.   With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.   Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.   Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.   Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.

All of her global database responsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his team, under Beth Apollo.

      "body": "\nMary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.   It is with regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.   Mary has contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the development of global information that has been critical in supporting our effective systems development and information gathering.   I do appreciate Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in wishing Mary well.   Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of the group led by Sheri Thomas.   Sheri will now report directly to Andy Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.   The Operations Product Control Team in its early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a smooth one for operations.   Much time was spent initially on the bridges necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.   The role of the team has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day   operations of EnronOnline.   With this evolution, it makes sense to have Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.   Sheri's team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.   Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this organizational realignment.   Sheri has done a great job of leading the Product Control Group over the past 14 months.   Sheri is committed to see that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations are shared with us.   We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri and her team.   \n"

Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on August 28 --- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.   I am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind the curve.   Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.   Brent and Scott Earnest are flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.   Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.   In a conversation with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts are coordinated.   Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic around systems issues that cut across the ocean.   I told him that you and I had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.   That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that down before the end of the month.   What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?   The summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.   I have checked Mark's travel schedule.   He will be in the Houston office next week, with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.   I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL operations.   I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late.   \n"

We will continue to investigate potential misstatements in the system p&amp;l, as a result of data or system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&amp;l values with traders.The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.Middle Office work being prioritised is as followsthe stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordinationan audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiringfull download of contract detail for later referencereconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 thsample tests of vanilla forward transactionsdetailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentationspreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysisthe circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysisthe debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rdI will be in touch directly re the items needing approvalRegardsMike---",

The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS4000, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA/excel reports outside of the AS4000 but using AS4000 data downloads.User requests for additional AS4000 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF.A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 closeA full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source documentation within EnronInspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basisSubstantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium valuesFull reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS4000 Barclays accountA risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movementsA full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )A full reconciliation of intercompany accountsA full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accountsI intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April If you have any questions please call me on x34703RegardsMike\n"

Will he be   able to coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort should be much broader than deal testing.   It should encompass assessing people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.   To do this quickly and effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in operations on a daily basis.   Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York offices.   From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.   Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily operational experience?   I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as well.   \n"

      "body": "\nTwo weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the United Way.   I was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused   Houston children and   the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents.   I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center.   Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge.   Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit organizations.   Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year.   The United Way campaign is the one time each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in Houston.   Each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by Enron.   If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing so as soon as possible.   Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next Wednesday, August 23.   I hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge.   There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.   Log on to http:///unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic pledge.   \n"

His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on July 1.   Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance review being based on his work for ENA.   Stephen is very talented and will no doubt do a great job at EBS.   During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.   It was his failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the relativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that category.   ---"

      "body": "\nTo all Energy Operations employees:ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.   I am especially proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.   I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that you have demonstrated.   We have done great work and I want to recognize you for that.   Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA and Energy Operations this year.   Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization --- S.J. Bashen Corporation --- to survey our organization; to \"take its pulse\" if you will; to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the \"necessary tools\" and breaking down any \"barriers.\"   SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.   SJBC will meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, and the like.   This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.   Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that input.   Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC consultant.   Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we cooperate to the fullest extent.   Of course, given the size of our group, it will not be possible to meet with each of you.   Therefore, if you have not received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.Communication is one of Enron's core values.   I want to stress that only through open communication will this survey be a success.   Please be candid.   Thank you.Sally \n"

This has been changed to November 10.   This event will now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve students from the Fellows group at Texas A&amp;M.   We were given this opportunity through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&amp;M recruiter).   Details will be sent to the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.   I realize this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!   We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive them from Career Services.Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with interviews on day 1 (October 30).   Just to update you on last week's interviews:We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.   I will send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!thanks!lexi3-4585\n"

She hopes to continue to work for Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York office.   It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some feedback on her.   In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.   She came to Houston and   has done a number of different things.   I think that she is well organized and control minded.   Understands Enron's business.   Managing a group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.   I am not sure that people enjoy working under her.   That could be old news, however.   There are a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her based on very recent experience.   Do you know of her?   Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.   Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.   She would definitely represent an Enron point of view.   They have two small daughters - she might be interested in something part time even.   Could mean lower cost that way.   This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.   If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you could go to for some fact finding around her.   Let me know.   ---Sally   \n"

I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.   If you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact them, just let me know.Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management practice.   Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client related), he left the firm.   He is extremely well respected by both the audit and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.   I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend him to Enron.   The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not interested in leaving Denver.   His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 00040.Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in Houston.   We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for Coral Energy and Equiva trading.   Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery itself as an engineer).   Mark was excellent to work with.   Clients are extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.   I would highly recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.   I spoke to him yesterday and he is interested in talking with you.   His direct number is 713 356 42333.   His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).   He works with my husband.   I know him on a personal basis.   He is trying to find opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of accounting for derivatives.   Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 1333 and all mtm accounting entries.   She liases with all book heads (crude and all products).   In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.   She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.   She is extremely diligent and very professional.   I enjoyed working with her greatly and have to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a client/professional relationship.   Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at the alliance and is extremely well respected.   She has had a difficult year as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.   She has mentioned to me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, and has even mentioned finding another job.   However, due to the fact that she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 2777 6280).   If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it due to the PwC/alliance relationship.Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a year, reporting to the VP of risk control.   Before that she was an audit manager at AA.   I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very conscientious.   I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! (713 230 3000 general line).Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred over from KPMG.   I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing what she had expected at AA.   I don't know her number but you could reach her at the general AA line.Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.   I do not know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.   He is the best senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have ever worked with (the top of his class).   Although he only has 4 years of work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.   He worked for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of the best people any of us have seen or worked with).   He is currently working on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office processes .   He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to manager.   I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His number is 713 356 5617.Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting and has work experience of about 9 months.   He is very interested in leaving Koch.   I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.   He is a good guy and very likeable.   I don't have his phone number, but should be reachable through the general number for Koch.Admin assistantsConnie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative assistant.   She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.   She is very interested in Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.   I have not worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC number).Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).\n"

My husband seemed&lt; &lt;&lt; pleased&lt; &lt;&lt; with my enthusiasm to get started.   The club encouraged me to keep a&lt; diary&lt; &lt;&lt; to chart my progress.&lt; &lt;&lt;   Monday:&lt; &lt;&lt;   Started my day at 6:000am. Tough to get out of bed, but found it&lt; was&lt; &lt;&lt; well&lt; &lt;&lt; worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Bruce waiting for&lt; me.&lt; &lt;&lt; He is something of a Greek God - with blond hair, dancing eyes and a&lt; &lt;&lt; dazzling white smile.   Woo Hoo!&lt; &lt;&lt;   Bruce gave me a tour and showed me the machines.   He took my&lt; pulse&lt; &lt;&lt; after five minutes on the treadmill.   He was alarmed that my pulse&lt; was so&lt; &lt;&lt; fast, but I attribute it to standing next to him in his Lycra&lt; aerobic&lt; &lt;&lt; outfit.&lt; &lt;&lt;   I enjoyed watching the skillful way in which he conducted his&lt; &lt;&lt; aerobics class after my   workout today. Very inspiring. Bruce was&lt; &lt;&lt; encouraging as I did my sit-ups, although my gut was already aching&lt; from&lt; &lt;&lt; holding it in the whole time he was around.&lt; &lt;&lt;   This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!!!&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   Tuesday:&lt; &lt;&lt;   I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out the&lt; door.&lt; &lt;&lt; Bruce&lt; &lt;&lt; made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air - then&lt; he&lt; &lt;&lt; put&lt; &lt;&lt; weights on it!   My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but I&lt; made&lt; &lt;&lt; the full mile.   Bruce's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile.&lt; &lt;&lt;   I feel GREAT! It's a whole new life for me.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   Wednesday:&lt; &lt;&lt;   The only way I can brush my teeth is by laying on the&lt; toothbrush on&lt; &lt;&lt; the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it.   I believe I&lt; have&lt; &lt;&lt; a&lt; &lt;&lt; hernia in both pectorals.&lt; &lt;&lt;   Driving was okay as long as I didn't' try to steer or stop.   I&lt; parked&lt; &lt;&lt; on top of a GEO in the club parking lot.   Bruce was impatient with&lt; me,&lt; &lt;&lt; insisting that my screams bothered other club members.   His voice&lt; is a&lt; &lt;&lt; little too perky for early in the morning and when he scolds, he&lt; gets&lt; this&lt; &lt;&lt; nasally whine that is VERY annoying.   My chest hurt when I got on&lt; the&lt; &lt;&lt; treadmill, so Bruce put me on the stair monster.&lt; &lt;&lt;   Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an&lt; activity&lt; &lt;&lt; rendered obsolete by elevators?   Bruce told me it would help me get&lt; in&lt; &lt;&lt; shape and enjoy life.   He said some other shit too.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   Thursday:&lt; &lt;&lt;   Bruce was waiting for me with his vampire-like teeth exposed as&lt; his&lt; &lt;&lt; thin, cruel lips were pulled back into a full snarl.   I couldn't&lt; help&lt; &lt;&lt; being&lt; &lt;&lt; a half an hour late, it took me that long to tie my shoes.   Bruce&lt; took me&lt; &lt;&lt; to work out with dumbbells.&lt; &lt;&lt;   When he was not looking, I ran and hid in the men's room. He&lt; sent&lt; &lt;&lt; Lars&lt; &lt;&lt; to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine -&lt; which I&lt; &lt;&lt; sank.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   Friday:&lt; &lt;&lt;   I hate that bastard Bruce more than any human being has ever&lt; hated&lt; &lt;&lt; any&lt; &lt;&lt; other human being in the history of the world.   Stupid,   skinny,&lt; anemic&lt; &lt;&lt; little cheerleader wanna-be bastard. If   there were a part of my&lt; body I&lt; &lt;&lt; could move without unbearable pain, I would beat him with it.&lt; &lt;&lt;   Bruce wanted me to work on my triceps.   I don't have any&lt; triceps!&lt; &lt;&lt; And if you don't want dents in the floor, don't hand me the &amp;@#$*~&lt; &lt;&lt; barbells&lt; &lt;&lt; or anything that weighs more than a sandwich. (Which I am sure you&lt; learned&lt; &lt;&lt; in the sadist school you attended and graduated magna cum laude&lt; from,&lt; &lt;&lt; Bruce,   you Nazi bastard).&lt; &lt;&lt;   The treadmill flung me off and I landed on a health and&lt; nutrition&lt; &lt;&lt; teacher.   Why couldn't it have been someone softer, like the drama&lt; coach&lt; &lt;&lt; or the choir director?&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   Saturday:&lt; &lt;&lt;   Bruce left a message on my answering machine in his grating,&lt; &lt;&lt; shrilly voice wondering why I did not show up today.   Just hearing&lt; him&lt; &lt;&lt; made&lt; &lt;&lt; me want to smash the machine with my planner.   However, I lacked&lt; the&lt; &lt;&lt; strength even to use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven&lt; straight&lt; &lt;&lt; hours of the *$@#&amp; Weather Channel.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;   Sunday:&lt; &lt;&lt;   I'm having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can&lt; go&lt; and&lt; &lt;&lt; thank GOD that this week is over.   I will also pray that next year&lt; my&lt; &lt;&lt; husband (the BASTARD) will choose a gift for me that is fun - like a&lt; root&lt; &lt;&lt; canal or a hysterectomy.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;Suzanne Cox&lt; &lt;Tenor Networks&lt; &lt;62000 S.

I have also been involved with the Entex contract valuation.   Dave Baumbach has been the real key to providing the data, and has all of the information.   Steve Jackson is talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional eyes and resources looking at this also.   I feel we have done a thorough job, but we do need everyone thinking of \"what if's.\"   Our risk books are complex, with many hand-offs internally.   Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the day.   I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.   After our meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our approach.   There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on (Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).FYI:   I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.   I have made arrangements to ensure that I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the Triple Lutz data room.   In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.   If any issues come up that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @ 713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.   Once again, DO NOT HESITATE TO CALL ME!!!   I do not want anything falling through the cracks!\n"

Nothing may come up, but I think that Tom would feel better with this gesture.   Probably wouldn't hurt to log the same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.   That will give all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on this project.   Do you have contact information for Brenda?   If not, I would get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.

I am scheduled for too many PRC meetings, so I had my dates confused.   I will get you pre-rankings before the 29th.   You have left Brent Price off of the list, a VP who reports to me.   Is Rick Causey planning to pre-rank Brent, or does he want me to handle that?   Do your records not show that Brent reports to me?   I approved his reviewers in the PEP system.   ---Sally   \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Sally Beck   111/27/2000 04:38 PM To: Kimberly Rizzi/HOU/ECT@ENRONcc:   Subject: Re: PreRank Sheets   The Energy Operations PRC meeting will be held on December 8th.   At that time, I will have information for you to load for Rick's PRC meeting on the 12th.

      "body": "\nWhew!!! Your schedule makes me tired!   I am sure that Brigeda is happy that you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!   Work sounds crazy for you, but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.   I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.   The week is kind of crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.   Sunday the 17th we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick friends, etc.   It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.   It will be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to continue.   On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to Longview for a visit.   A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:000 that day has excused us from the trip.   So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin after 4:000 on Monday.   We could be back by the time David and company return to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.   Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A Christmas Carol at the Alley   Theater, sans Tyler.   Thursday I am having all of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.   And Friday is Tyler's birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, but nothing else done yet!).   So I really think that our only shot to make it to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.   I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for Christmas.   I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope that doesn't mess up your Christmas.   They have only been here for one or two Christmases with us since we have had kids.   I think that Tyler at 3 this year will be particularly enthralled.   And next year they will have 2 grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for them to come.   She said she would think about it, and I told her that I wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly okay if they decided that they did not want to come.   How about Dad playing golf this week?   What a difference!!! I am so glad that he is doing better.   I hear you about Mom.   I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly predictable, unfortunately.   She seems to do that a lot at special occassions for Cara, doesn't she?   I will certainly help in any way I can.   And I will be very interested in the gosipy details.   Happy baking!   I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with 27 packages of fudge.   \"Cindy White\" &lt;cwhite@viviance.com&lt; on 12/07/2000 09:25:444 AMTo: &lt;Sally.Beck@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: RE: Baby ShowerGot your message last night---sorry I missed you---must have been in theshower.   We are all going nuts here, too.   We have a huge deadline here atwork.   But I worked most of last weekend so am ahead of the curve.   Goodthing, since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school eventsthis week and next.   LAst night was \"lessons and carols\" by the schoolchoir---with me decorating, baking, and coordinating.   Today I go to schoolto make Christmas stockings with the kids---Sunday is the school ChristmasBazaar at the Four Seasons---need to bring an item for the bake sale.   Alsoneed to start baking 12 gingerbread houses for Brigeda's class.   Did finda matching mold to the smaller one we have so I can at least bake two atonce---twelve bakes is MUCH better than 24!   And then there is that dollhousethat needs my attention by the 25!I am totally ok with us not doing the shower.   We get credit for offeringbut don't have to do anything.   Both money and time are in such short supplyfor me that it works out for the best.   At work we start on a contract forDell in January.   The company is also going to pay for Java programmingclasses for some of us (if I can nail this down then I can jump up to aprogrammer level on that pay scale).   I also have a private contract jobwith a needlepoint store in Memphis to setup their website.Am somewhat concerned that Mother will have one of her dramas when Cara'sbaby comes...you know she will get her feelings hurt somehow.   Not tomention the fact that she will be sharing the grandchild with \"the mostselfish woman on earth.\"   Richard and Brigeda went out to the Lowrimore farm(they sold it and offered us all of the firewood).   Jane couldn't have beensweeter to Brigeda---spent a lot of time with her.   Can just imagine that\"pained\" look in Mother's face at the hospital.   If you are not here mayneed you to carry your cell phone so I can call for moral support---or atleast give you gossipy updates on the drama...Are you planning to come later this month when you are off?   I'm taking offthe 21st and 222nd---they have given all of the technical production staff thedays between Christmas and New Years as comp time so I will be off until the2nd...Cindy---Original Message---From: Sally.Beck@enron.com [mailto:Sally.Beck@enron.com]Sent: Wednesday, December 06, 2000 6:51 PMTo: 'cwhite@viviance.com'Subject: Baby ShowerWell, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?

Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.   Inoticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)Hope you all are doing fine.

I thought that it might be helpful to have this in writing to add to your list.   Beginning with a fiscal year that starts April 20001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. We have over 3000 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.   We run bingo games in local nursing homes, provide \"coaching\" during practices for Special Olympics volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.   It is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only on themselves.   The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.   \n"

      "body": "\nPatti:   I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention later in April.   She says that Ken and Jeff encourage board membership in community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of that.   So according to Cindy, the days at convention will not be counted as vacation days.   I guess I would view this as if I were in LA on business, so no notation on time out of the office.   Thanks. ---"

The kids love our home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate party!) We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the football season very strongly, winning all games to date.   That means that we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.   Meagan is on the drill team and must be at all games.   Last year, we played right up to Thanksgiving in the playoffs.   So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan. We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.   Do you have a list of what is available for those schools?   \"Jacobs, Ted K\" &lt;tjacobs@ou.edu&lt; on 09/23/2000 03:07:111 PMTo: \"'Sally.Beck@enron.com'\" &lt;Sally.Beck@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: RE: Oklahoma TripThanks for the nice words.

Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 5000 employees in the Enron building.   Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?   I have noted below the approximate number of employees per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of operations employees):   29th Floor (trading) 67 employees   EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, settlements and EIM risk   30th Floor (trading) 35 employees   EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various products)   31st Floor (trading) 52   employees   Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., settlements and DPR   and MPR teams   32nd Floor (trading) 1117 employees   Gas risk, logistics (all regions), operational analysis   37th Floor   148 employees   Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global services   Also, given the fact that operations is a relative \"newcomer\" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   ---Sally ---"

We might spend one night or two - plan something&lt; fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad&lt; with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just&lt; go&lt; somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.&lt;&lt; Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a&lt; more&lt; special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San&lt; Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.&lt;&lt; This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but&lt; provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom&lt; and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.

I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her class selection.   Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was thinking!!!   Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 222 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and add a study hall.   She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which is probably exactly what she needs.   I was prepared to go all the way to the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily I didn't have to go that far.   Hope that you have a good weekend!

This finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting.

I instructed him to tell them that we would be happy to set up a meeting for later next week to sit down with them and OA to discuss the process, the April numbers and the reconciliation of those numbers.   As I believe you all know, the entry that we had to book in March was close to $49 million and the April entry was closer to $25 million.   They know how the process works and should understand that the variances coming from the first several months are primarily timing, but experience tells me that they will over react if we simply turn over the analysis showing $49 as they have requested.   In light of the current reconciliation effort do you think we will be able to talk to them about the older items ( I would suggest only discussing things that fall into the 1999 and prior category) late next week?Let me know your thoughts.\n"

If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,   then no further approval process is necessary.   If the sign on bonus amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   In our current case, a $5,000.000 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not require additional approval except your own.

Admittedly the reasons will now be obvious for the request, we can simply tell those checked that it was overlooked originally.   Relative to Ilkka, there is no harm in requesting it as well.

Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who led this effort) and we had mixed results.   The study was designed to cover gas and power.   Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.   Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very useful.   I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.   Thanks for passing it along, however.   I would be happy to convey this directly   to the person that has contacted you.

I personally like Bob a lot, and am very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.   His wife has MS in its most severe stages.   He was a manager previously, and we jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.   He needs to be able to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a caregiver who is with his wife while he works.   I made a personnal commitment to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will personally make sure that works for him.   I would hope for him that if he ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.   Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what impact it would have on gas if he moved.   I suggested that Brent would be better able to address that.   I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that they are not long on people.   I assume that Danny is following up with Brent.   ---Sally \tBarry Pearce @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS\t06/13/2000 03:47 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Bob BowenWhat do you think of him?Danny suggested him.

I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and outside work - either way will work well for me.   ---Sally \tPeggy Hedstrom\t02/05/20001 04:19 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Calgary TripJust wanted to let you know that our weather has turned a little colder this week.   We have a little bit of fresh snow and the temperature is in the high 20's, however with the windchill it's more like 20 F.   For dinner on Wednesday, Laura has a Spanish class at 7:000.   We have a couple of options.   We could go to dinner at Joey Tomatoes right after the meeting at 5:000.   Or, we could go for a drink with Laura after the meeting and you and I could go to dinner afterwards. My preference would be to eat earlier rather than later, but I'm pretty flexible.   Let me know which works better for you.\n"

      "body": "\nThanks for copying me on this.   It is interesting to see your thoughts.   I suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.   I told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.   However, I also told him about my two dark-side fears:   (1)   that IT resources reporting to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on projects that we need, and (2)   taken to the extreme, that this concept would disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this special team for them to handle.   Part of the fun in operations is improving things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the chance to implement creative business solutions.   Richard Sage08/111/2000 10:10 AMTo: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve Whitaker/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: CommodityLogic.comMike,Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as EnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron, but let's put ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely on anything until we see everything working.Handling counterparties not using the systemThe challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.How much resource is leftThe latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through costing for \"What happens if we completely stop development of X project?\". If that shows one would need 2000 clerks for 3 years until something else comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases it is not!Start small to prove conceptE.g. first application in April 20001 only covers 20 fieldsThis is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be years before we can switch off many internal systems.We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 years out?Include European aspects from the beginningThis really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!80-20 rule for types of transactionEOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk (RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of certain deals in Power999 which are approximations of the actual deals, and manually tweaked every so often)TestingTom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not pay) to do much of the testing.EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many external users early in the process. It did have massive resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear \"short people\", that strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional resource, even after MG is absorbed.What else did you come up with?Richard\n"

We had hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two \"test runs\" with Ed Baughman and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.   With any suggested changes from those test runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.   We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual meetings with lead originators and their teams.

Also, from discussions with Fernley the higher grades will form part of Rick Causey's PRC ranking process - so we are left with lower risk post that ( Fernley said he would forward his note to Rick to yourself ).My remaining concern is that any promotions, particularly in the risk group, which are not matched across Houston/London or indeed between EGM London and EEL London may create people risk. Can I suggest we compare promotions from senior specialist ( up to manager ) upwards ?Hope everything is going wellMike \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   Sally Beck   27/111/2000 20:08 To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally   I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be held in Houston.   There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.   The pre-meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups.   (In addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)   The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM and EIM.   We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.   I have asked that the results from the pre-review meetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories.   Assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy.   We will take considerably more time as we review the managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.   This will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.   We will then review and rank the directors and senior directors.   We will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well.   Finally, assuming that I still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.   (We will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing --- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda Herod from EIM.)   I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to attend the December 8th meeting.   I do not know yet if she will attend.   Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this year?   I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this.   Would you like to attend the meeting here in Houston on December 8th?   Is there a planned meeting in London that would make sense for me to attend?   Let me know your thoughts.   -Sally   Mike Jordan111/24/2000 04:28 AMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Cross calibration for Operations people globallySallyI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross calibration done by yourself.

The pre-meetings are necessary due to the sheer size of the groups.   (In addition to the meetings detailed in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)   The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM and EIM.   We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists and below.   I have asked that the results from the pre-review meetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should therefore be in the bottom two categories.   Assuming that appropriate work has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not be too lengthy.   We will take considerably more time as we review the managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.   This will give us a good jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.   We will then review and rank the directors and senior directors.   We will also be discussing suggested promotions during this meeting as well.   Finally, assuming that I still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.   (We will of course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels that we are reviewing --- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda Herod from EIM.)   I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to attend the December 8th meeting.   I do not know yet if she will attend.   Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this year?   I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the year to help facilitate this.   Would you like to attend the meeting here in Houston on December 8th?   Is there a planned meeting in London that would make sense for me to attend?   Let me know your thoughts.   -Sally   Mike Jordan111/24/2000 04:28 AMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Cross calibration for Operations people globallySallyI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross calibration done by yourself.

This could be particularly critical with the Contract Exchange module and might be one assurance customers would want before signing up.For that matter, is there a market in providing disaster recovery / hot-backup capability to companies in high-risk areas?   It has traditionally been thought of as too expensive to warrant implementing such a capability for our own purposes.   Perhaps there are economies of scale that can be recognized when providing this capability for many.\n"

At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs.   With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.   My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall summary of reasons to disband the team.   In addition, Joel and his team had recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the projects in which they were involved.   The update had the exact opposite effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.   After the two hour session, it appeared to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, etc.   If my reaction had been to say \"what a talented group - we have to figure out how to best utilize them\", then the outcome might have been different.   But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.   That two hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious make any other decision after further investigation.   ---Sally Mike Jordan02/27/20001 01:29 AMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Disbanding of Joel Henenberg's Team   Thanks for this - given volume increases and our need to develop and test new systems that is a stretch target !!!

To make the best decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value proposition.As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.   To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end users.   Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.   Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few weeks.   Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.   While it was a tough decision, I feel comfortable having made it.   \n"

Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle the RMT Confirmations?

      "body": "\nI saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis that this will be kept up.   I sent the note below to Kim.   I am sure that she manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the organization.   It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be completed.   That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't address that.   If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing the task.   Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one that gets the phone calls.   The ENA organization must develop confidence in others on our team.   Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly communicate information that addresses his needs.   Thanks.   ---"

They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do so.   We used Enpower as a phrase meaning \"Proper Risk System\".   If there are real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of Enron 75000 miles away that doesn't understand.   That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly hip to having the best platform available.   It was Enron NetWorks that said that they could implement a \"controlled spreadsheet environment\" that would have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.

Although EnPower would be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the transaction volume there is not much we can do.

A couple things to consider...Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location (bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).   Based on this, I want to set South America up on their own instance.   EnPower will have the following instances long term:   EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.   We will continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a production environment that will eventually need to be split.Glad to discuss...

Do they get Enron e:mails?   How often does Lou go to London or someone from London mid office come to New York?

I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.   While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good option.   I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.   After several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no meetings.   That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your document on the list for more careful review on Friday.   I can send you a note then if there are any other comments that I have.   I should have apologized   in the first paragraph for standing you up while you were here in Houston.   Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the calculations (he was over his limit that day --- never any questions when he is under!).   I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person sometime in the not too distant future.   Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business controllers for all commodities and offices.   I am working on securing a location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential dates.   More details to come on that in the next day or so.   I know that is a long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join us.   \n"

Sharron will let me know what Rick says today.   Then, I'll call Sue White to start getting the ball rolling with schedules on campus.

Interviewers were Gene Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.   The four of us met this morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.   Based on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today with the names of the three suggested award winners.   I conveyed this via voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.   She had told me that her schedule would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow morning.   She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.

Bill and I have been working with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a   resource to help insure all internal controls (specific to   trading activities) are in place in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as an origination unit   with the London office being responsible for supplying the coal.   Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to determine the net   MTM   for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.   These books should include both the intercompany purchase from London   and the 3rd party sales.   The commercial group in India   will be responsible for local curves   (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and energy operations (this will probably be you   initially until the trading activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process (including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general ledger and financials.   There will also be a logistics process.   The following questions need to be addressed:   With the increased   coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be required?   My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the   policy, if necessary.

Both Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.   I know that North America included US drift in its plan and includes \"drift earnings\" in its margin.   I believe you do the same in Europe.   Jeff is adamant that we not   move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has asked for UK drift to remain, as well.   You may want to call Jeff.

(None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon or over the weekend anyway.)   Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).   They will likely come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation could be tweaked.   With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).   We can start those next week and finish most next week.   I think that the logistics of any offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we need one.   Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to deliver it.   You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on that day for us to cover this information.   Laura Luce is here today and will be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 111.   I have booked time with her that afternoon to cover the presentation.   That will leave Portland as the other \"out of towner\" to schedule.   I am planning a trip there the next time that Stacey White heads up there.   Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 or 19.   We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk team.   I would   welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.   You and I can discuss the appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch tomorrow.   I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage and input.   Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?   ---Sally From: Greg Piper/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/05/20001 03:25 PMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rahil Jafry/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: FW: Costs/Mid Back office commercializationWhy don't you and Rahil agree on the draft ASAP and then let Rahil send it out in draft form this Friday afternoon to all these individuals for their review and comments.   Rahil can work with these people directly next week on their comments.

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an offsite together.   How about circulating the presentation and then letting them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.   One on ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.

Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.   We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.   Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).   We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.   If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.   I added the Calgary guy and Max.   I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.   They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.   We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.   Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.   ---Sally   Louise Kitchen04/04/20001 03:50 PMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: CostsWeren't we supposed to be having a meeting on costs of back office services with the Heads of Origination?

(this might be the crisis which would drive out the weaker players which would mean that the remaining players would be only dealing with better---organised counterparties which would decrease the number of fails)This last point prompts the thought that the quickest way to generate lots of demand for EEO services from outside would be to have the standard cycle times reduced (have FERC insist?).

        " Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 07/20/2000 07:17 PM ---\tPeggy Hedstrom\t07/20/2000 10:49 AM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1   Thanks for your prompt response.   I really hope that you can convince Mark Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right thing to do.   As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the service to Calgary previously.   This seems to work in the short term, but as soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs regularly, the service level starts to drop.   I would like you to consider the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary when you meet with Mark.First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.   At that time, we had one attorney   who did not have expertise in the financial area.   We now have three very competent attorneys.   Greg Johnston has spent time in Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.   Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by Houston and with the process itself.   At the time of the Project Doorstep audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent out after we had approved them.   As you saw from my memo, confirmations are periodically sent out without our review.   Also, we have found mistakes in the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the confirmation.   The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.   Some of the confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big problem.   We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, which is even a bigger problem.   Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston generate the confirmations.   If you think about what the process is, the transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if done by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron North America.   Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.   If the counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of execution.   For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the follow-up.   All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary office.   If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same pre-approved templates that Houston is using.   It is not clear to me where there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare our own financial confirmations.   If there is some perception that an element of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.   Currently, Houston has staff handling the Calgary transactions.   Because the confirmations are reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on issues or execution.   We are currently following up on all non-trading company financial confirmations.   So, we are both printing and reviewing the transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these documents.   As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for the financial confirmations without adding any staff.Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.   Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the transaction being done.   We feel this time line could be met if we did the financial confirmations here.   This reduces risk for Enron.Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the company in order to broaden their knowledge base.   Given the skill sets of the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to keep them challenged within the documentation group.   Because we review the confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already exists.   However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.As a final note, I report to you.   I am fully accountable to you for ensuring that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function properly.   It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this function to Calgary.   Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.   I hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.   He just needs to look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that exists here.If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in this memo, please let me know.   As you can see, the Calgary office feels very strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.   Please let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.Thanks,Peggy   \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Sally Beck   07/19/2000 04:57 PM To: Peggy Hedstrom/CAL/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1   I got your message and I have asked Brent to get with me when he is back in the office on Friday ( he has been in New York re: MG since Monday night).

Mark Taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to provide excellent service to them.   While I can appreciate that Diane is out, that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the Calgary stuff.   Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen.   While I know that they can't appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still need to be able to deliver top notch service.   Unfortunately, we stub our toe enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service.   That is a terrible internal PR issue.   Let's put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their perceptions) and   can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by   Rob Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).   She responded to Rob quickly and handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with you at the time.

Can we delay until then?   We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our revenue line to date.   I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.   Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.   I suspect that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost centers.   By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as revenue?   Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should be pure margin.   Hey, you have to start somewhere!   I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.   I don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated to the business units.   Next week I can give you more info on that.   From: Kerry Roper/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/03/20001 01:555 PMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Forecast for 20001Sally,One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT for the remainder of 20001.   For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.   Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 20001.   Do you have a feel for an amount I can put into our analysis and will 1000% of your costs continue to be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know in a few days I would appreciate it. Kerry Roper (x5-4895)\n"

      "body": "\nThanks for your comments on the standards.   Our approach in creating a global exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.   Our initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical standards by the end of this year.   That will be a first, to on a daily basis have a view into the exceptions outside the global   standards.   Many of the measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence of those that are managing these services.   Some of these may be more appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the wholesale merchant services companies.   Give me a call and we can set a time to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with you.   We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.   Shona has taken a stab at the format of these exception reports.   It is likely that we will have a rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these reports.   Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for these activities.   My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as needed to clear the exceptions.   It is invariably the deals that are exceptions in some way that create the problems.   For instance, small power deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.   These were \"on the side\" and not captured in total power exposure because they didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).   If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.   By having a prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate attention to correct them.   The spur for making sure that all exceptions are appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the appropriate operations controller.   I will make sure that as we start this reporting process that this is well understood.   The other impetus will be that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged against these standards.   The AA internal audits should also access adherence to these.   From:   David Port @ ENRON   111/10/2000 01:46 PM\t   To: Shona Wilson/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Fundamental Operating StandardsThis is the first time I have seen these - have they been rolled out ?I would be interested to see the format of the exception reporting that attaches to these standards that you mentioned - did you have anything particular in mind ?I had a few of my own ideas for some diagnostic measures of the extent to which these standards are being adhered to - see what you think:Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)Daily report of \"holdovers\" by commodity group (trades not booked in time for daily cut - off, including counterparty, volume, price etc)Report of P&amp;L effect of booking errors as they transpire, including responsibilityDaily Management P&amp;L and Position reporting is accurate and timely (completeness, accuracy)Periodic qualitative review by RAC (i.e. Is it sufficient by reference to the Risk Management Policy - does it show delta gamma vega as a term structure etc...)NB: the point about \"Reports issued on next day of trading at a commercially pre-determined time\" conflicts with the Risk Managemet Policy, which says \"...before any subsequent trading ocurrs\". I think the diagnostic measure should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as final (note I do not neccessarily mean \"officialized\") after the relevant market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, existence)Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) - outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) - outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmationsshowing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, agedSettlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non Dashed deals)Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal reference if anyUnmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward MTM valueOne additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment will come into play here. Perhaps the \"pilot\" report should be put together somehow independently.Views ?DP\n"

These standards are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the operations process.   Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.   Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.

I had a meeting arranged for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so there is going to be no further progress on this front.In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston (and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be completed as part of the curve validation If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.James\n"

I agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this.   I believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.   I know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled   that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that momentum.   I am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait.   I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines.Please keep me up informed on this matter.Thanks and good luck with the students.mike \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Sally Beck   10/02/2000 07:13 PM To: Charlene Jackson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Celeste Roberts/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer InternsWhile recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made at the Program level to not interview this fall for 20001 summer interns.   In talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for summer 20001 interns.   I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's staffing.   When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.   It would seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for our Analyst and Associates programs.   I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with no resolution.   When they could not provide the competitive data to either confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.   Lexi and Shelley either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do so.   They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this critical information.   I now have information at hand with regard to firms that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring top students as interns for the summer of 20001 if we do not interview for these positions this fall.   While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.   As administrators of the program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to carry the Enron message to campus.   I believe that we also have an obligation to make this a two-way messaging system.   I strongly believe that we must address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.   I suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer internships.   In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the decision on interviewing summer interns.   I have copied both of them on this note to the two of you. Please let me know how this can be resolved.   With the help of James Scribner and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that should be targeted for summer internships.

I am also grateful for the opportunity to get back to work!!!As to your visitI will try to clear the week - the only potential curveball is my desire to be in NY when we do the NY doorstep( timing is uncertain ). I want to hammer home the need for absolute clarity re the remote office control structure and to review the SAP implementation work - both should be in place .I will put together a list of issues/subjects that I would like to update you on over the next day or so   - we should be able to use that as a working agenda and a start point for scheduling time.If there is anything else you would like to review specifically, I will get the necessary preparation done.Cheers and Happy New YearMike \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   Sally Beck   27/12/2000 23:12 To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Holiday Wrap Up and January PlansHope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for shopping were fruitful.   I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but certainly felt as if I worked very hard --- shopping, wrapping, baking, volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 222nd (3 years old - not very good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!   I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of January 15.   I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through Thursday in the office there.   I have blocked those days on my calendar and Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.   How does that work with your schedule?   Will you be in the office that week and what is your schedule like?   I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if   you don't have some time available.   Let me know, and then we can firm up discussions topics and agendas.   (My thought on that particular week is that it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the office during the week of January 222 and thereafter to communicate bonus information.)   I am in the office all of this week.   ---Sally \n"

I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.   They are the logical experts for that discussion.   Your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.   Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.   I believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP.   James and Mary (I refer to both because James has only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss how this process works.   If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.   As is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 6000% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do.   Your input will help James in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.   I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today.   With your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Much effort has been put forth in   \"cleansing\" the parent/subsidiary information presented in Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except for on an ad hoc, manual basis. What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading positions properly,   let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data population efforts. Your comments and ideas are welcome. Debbie\n"

I assume that you have talked with both Mary Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.   They are the logical experts for that discussion.   Your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.   Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.   I believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from Entelligence into GCP.   James and Mary (I refer to both because James has only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss how this process works.   If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.   As is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 6000% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do.   Your input will help James in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.

      "body": "\nThanks for your list.   I have talked with Brent and of the three names that you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.   I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they should be included.   While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are depending on to stress and enforce controls.   Heidi particularly does have active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day basis.   And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their locations - weather, coal, etc.I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting to him when I saw him in San Antonio.   He can certainly respectfully decline!

After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me with a beautiful daughter!   Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 111:18 am in San Antonio.   She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.   She is so tiny and has a head full of dark hair!   I brought her home last night at 8:30 pm.   Our first night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.   It's going to take some time for me to get used to the noises she makes.   I must admit, there weredays when I never thought this would happen.   I appreciate all the kind words of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few yearsas I have gone through this process, especially during the really low points.   I am truly blessed.I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm sure I'll be logging in often.   Also, if I left someone off the list here, please have them forgive me.   Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.   Please feel free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.   Thanks.Dianne\n"

One of the programs that he would like to continue at Enron is the Job Shadow program.   This program entails a half-day commitment once per month beginning with the fall school semester.   The high school students are first given an overview of Enron and then a tour of the building.   The students then spend approximately 1-1/2 hours directly with individuals within specific departments.   Cliff would like to have as many departments as possible participate since this may be the only exposure these students have to the business world.Please advise if you are willing to have your department participate, who your contact person is, and how many students that you would like to host each time.Thank you for your consideration.Susan\n"

Thank you.Mark Frevert &amp; Cliff Baxter___\tCliff Baxter\t08/222/2000 111:07 AM Subject: We Need YouSome of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, Enron's representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding participation in Enron's Junior Achievement program.   Since so many changes have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and broadening it to reach more departments.One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job Shadowing.   This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to succeed in the work place.   A successful Job Shadowing program requires your department's commitment and participation.The Job Shadowing program consists of the following: 9:000 - 10:30 AM   Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour   10:30 - 12:000 N   Job Shadow Experience with Enron Employees and/or Departments 12:000 - 1:000 PM   Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing CommentsEnron has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 20001.   We need your assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 12:000 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.   Employees participating in Job Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and closing comments.   If enough departments participate, it is possible that each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.   Please advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by August 30, 2000. Department Name: Job Shadowing Contact Name: Number of Students: Individual to Assist With Tours:We appreciate your consideration and participation in promoting Junior Achievement and Enron.Cliff Baxter and Mark Frevert\n"

Have you seen Brent yet?   ---Sally   \tFrom:   D Todd Hall   04/10/2000 12:20 PM To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: LondonSally,I wanted to give you a quick update.I met with Fernley last Friday and we had a good discussion.   He wanted to know my initial assessment of the project and a rough time-line.   I admire the fact that he took almost 30 minutes of his time to show his interest in this project and myself.   I told him that it would be prudent for me to return a month after implementation of the book splits.   This way I can ensure that the processes and tools are in place and used by both the traders and the support staff.   If Brent needs some assistance at that time, I could stay for a 2-week span and meet two needs on one trip.I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk.   When I asked Mark about the impact of the traders leaving, he said that they are probably trading even more.   Tim Norton is meeting with Mark today and assuming things go well, he could began training almost immediately.I'll try to call you tomorrow,Todd\n"

While I am familiar with most if not all of these employees, I DO NOT know all of the above criteria for everyone.   These are the types of issues I anticipate being raised at the larger PRC and I need to make sure that I can answer any question raised.I will sit down with each one of you and discuss each employee page individually after the PRC.   I would like to use this page as the PRIMARY feedback form for us to deliver to each employee.   This should supplement the system feedback form that we have used in the past.   At that time, I plan to roll out a group strategy and what is going to be expected from you and your groups in order for all of us to accomplish the known goals and objectives of our business.   I anticipate having these meetings completed by the end of July with feedback beginning around August 1st and finished by August 31st.   This will give us plenty of time to plan around any issues that arise, however I would encourage you to get the feedback completed as soon as possible.Last but by no means least, I would like to thank each and everyone of you for all of your hardwork and dedication to our business.   We have had many achievements and accomplishments and have taken on many new challenges and opportunities.   This is a direct compliment to you and I wanted to say THANK YOU!Have a GREAT Holiday Weekend!Scott \n"

Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in London on May 8th.Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more week, to May 15th.Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 111, but apparently his plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize my plans around his leaving on May 111, and he relocate to a hotel if he needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out with him instead of returning early.Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out   date to him, I guess we work around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 222 as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may continue to drag on day-by-day.Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how strict \"two full working days\" is, we may actually need for him to be out no later than Wednesday, May 17---or even Wednesday, May 10.)Cheers,Tom x333926 \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. - Europe \tFrom:   Mark Pickering   05/03/2000 12:222 PM To: Tom E Moore/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Beth Perlman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: MoveTom,I just heard today that you're not arriving until the 18th as Todd Hall is in the apartment.

I have to leave for the airport after the meeting (off to exotic Dallas) and that will just make it that much easier for me if the meeting is at my house.

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.   Another thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to an Astro's game.   I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of tickets for games.   I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.   We could discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.   I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.   If not too many are tied up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.   Thanks for making the calls.   I am making up this quarter for only a little travelling at the end of the year.   Report from the Calgary office today is that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime tempurature reading!).I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.

If all else fails,   Sarah Marshall (yes, that is right) probably knows more about car care than   anyone I know...the girls call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory   is that the first thing is to turn down the___ radio as you are backing out   the drive, so you can hear your car...pretty basic.?Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house??? I   will email agenda for that meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with   girls about nominations and let you know when they can meet...we will go from   there.? Is this okay with you.?

I would be glad to call them and make arrangements if you let me know.   Any ideas on car care?   Seems like Joy Martin mentioned her husband as a possible \"expert\" there.   Or should we try to call Firestone or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?   I am headed to Calgary for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls before I leave.   On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.   I would be glad to meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from Calgary around 6:000 pm), Friday night or Saturday.   I can get you this list if you need to meet with the committee before then.   It may be tough to get the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?   The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy tickets at the door ($4).   Problem is that SAT's are given that day.   Meagan is signed up to take them.   I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT that day?   If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay if Meagan misses.   If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work.   Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she contacts them about this weekend's meeting.   They could check their schedules and then we could get a count.   I will also look into other possible dates and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.

Many of Enron's Executives and VPs recognize the importance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for these interviews.   However, many more offices are needed.   The interview process begins at approximately 9:000 a.m. and will conclude by 1:000 p.m. that Saturday.   If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the materials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential documents to one side of your desk and/or credenza.   We will see that the materials are turned \"face down\" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as not to disturb their original state.   Unlike previous years, the Enron interviewers will be in the designated offices at all times with the candidates.   All offices will be locked after the completed interview process.   Please let me know the availability of your office for interviews at your earliest convenience.   We encourage your participation and appreciate your support.   \n"

The spreadsheets that they are getting that information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.   The value is captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would be doublecounting credit risk.   The spreadsheet download has a specific download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name   (which in this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)   I am working with Debbie to figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty at all from the spreadsheet.   It will be done as quickly as possible.Thanks\n"

I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year.   I would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU this last time.   I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago office.   I will let you know what I hear back from him.   Consider Shona Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 &amp; 31.   Finally, I have noted November 10 on my calendar for the management overview.   Keep me posted on details.   ---Sally   \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Lexi Elliott @ ENRON   10/16/2000 06:333 PM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Edward Coats/Corp/Enron@ENRON, James Scribner/Corp/Enron@Enron, Tamara Hopkins/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON, Edward D Baughman/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick Wade/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark McConnell/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Eric Moon/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephen Plauche/Corp/Enron@Enron, Angie Zeman/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Justin O'Malley/HOU/EEES@EES, Jody Crook/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Patrick Maloy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rafael Avila/HOU/EEES@EES, Nate Blackburn/NA/Enron@Enroncc: Cathy Phillips/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patti Thompson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Donna Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Beth Miertschin/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: OU UpdateDear OU Team:I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting season:According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View on October 19 and 20.   This has been changed to November 10.   This event will now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve students from the Fellows group at Texas A&amp;M.   We were given this opportunity through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&amp;M recruiter).   Details will be sent to the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.   I realize this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!   We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive them from Career Services.Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with interviews on day 1 (October 30).   Just to update you on last week's interviews:We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.   I will send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!thanks!lexi3-4585\n"

These change=\rs=20\rare intended to accomplish four key objectives:\r First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=\rl=20\rbusiness model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\r=20\rThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\raround a relatively small strategic asset position.\r Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\rrelationships.   Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=\r=20\rdirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=\r=20\rhas become increasingly difficult.\r Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\rg=20\rthe ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20\rhindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\rg=20\rasset positions.\r And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=\r=20\rredeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.\r ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\r Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=\r=20\rour global wholesale businesses.   The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\rbusinesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20\rcoordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\r=20\rhigher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20\ropportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=\rf=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=\rd=20\rmarkets.\r Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=\r=20\r(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\roperations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=\rnit=20\ras well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.   In addition, Enron=01,s me=\rrchant=20\rbusinesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=\r=20\rnew structure as described below.\r Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=\re=20\rthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.   Greg Whalley,=20\rcurrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=\r=20\rof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.\r Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\r=20\rinternational business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\rp=20\rpositions:\r Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=\r=20\rand CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=\ry=20\rfor managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=\rorth=20\rAmerica and Europe.   Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=\r=20\rwill be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.   Rebecca and Jim will=20\rreport to the EWS Office of the Chairman.\r Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\rhe=20\rMiddle East and Asia region.   Sanjay will be responsible for building our=\r=20\rbroadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=\r=20\rwill report to Sanjay.   In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =\rof=20\rthe Chairman.   In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=\r=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=\rness=20\rinto Enron Global Assets in the near future.\r=20\rDiomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\r=20\rEBS as Chief Commercial Officer.   Diomedes will be located in London and wi=\rll=20\rfocus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20\rattention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.   Diomedes will report to=\r=20\rthe EBS Office of the Chairman.\r Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=\rS=20\rto lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.   In or=\rder=20\rto ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20\rfacilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=\r=20\rat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\rh=20\rAmerica.   Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=\r=20\rthe Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.   Following the=20\rtransition, Jim will join EES.\r In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20\ractivities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=\r=20\rbusinesses and the commercial support functions:\r Enron Net Works\rLouise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\r and=20\rCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\r Enron Americas\rConcurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=\r=20\roperating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20\rmarketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=\rt=20\rinto a new entity, Enron Americas.   Enron Americas will have responsibility=\r=20\rfor all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20\rAmerica.   Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\rOperating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20\rAmericas.\r Enron Europe\rThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=\rralia=20\rand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\r=20\rSherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.\r Enron Global Markets\rEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=\r=20\rCEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20\rresponsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.   With the=20\rexception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20\rassociated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=\r=20\rEnron Global Assets.   Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=\r=20\rcommodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20\requities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.\r Enron Industrial Markets\rEnron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=\rahon,=20\rPresident &amp; CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.\r Commercial Support for EWS\rThe commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=\ry,=20\rthe individual business units.   We are creating no incremental overhead in=\r=20\rthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\r=20\refficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.\r To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=\r=20\rEWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.

This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P and A/R.   SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie was able to block or net the payment.   When SAP came back up the next day, the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.   If you have any further questions about this, call me.   Thanks.

You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.Thank you,Russell\n"

Cindy said you would be in town andthat would be a fun celebration, and Cindy and family will join us.   I amalso going to invite my cousins, Fab and Mary Anne.

With this change, we want to promote Jeff Gossett to Manager effective May 1.   The following describes the reorganization and justification for the promotion.The Risk Management, Operational Analysis, Transport Rates and Deal Validation groups will be realigned into four regional teams and managed by Business Controllers.   There will also be a centralized Controls group with 2-3 individuals that will be managed by a different Business Controller.   With this realignment, we are creating five new manager positions (four regional and one Controls) and eliminating the two manager positions for the Deal Validation and the Operational Analysis/Transport Rates groups.   The regional Business Controllers will be responsible for managing the day-to-day activities of their regional teams, including interacting with the Trading Desk Directors, and the Controls manager will work across the regional teams to ensure consistency and efficiency in our processes.The new Controller positions will be filled as follows:West - Jeff Gossett Central - Carrie HollomonEast - Will Kelly (Senior Specialist)Controls - Kathryn CordesTexas - TBD (Brenda Herod to hire)We are promoting Jeff Gossett at this time due to the responsibilities he will be carrying in the Controller role in addition to his current responsibilities for the NGP&amp;L and Benchmark functions.   Will Kelly's performance will be evaluated during the next few months to determine if he will be the permanent Controller for the East region.   If he performs well in this role, mid-year promotion will be pursued.Please let me know if you have any questions.   I will follow-up next week to discuss a salary adjustment for Jeff Gossett.Thanks,Susan   \n"

After graduation, Ispent   the first four months of my rotation program in Enron at the Asia PacificStructuring   Group. There I honed my analytical skills, commercial knowledge andcross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk assessment.I   provided   robust   analytical   support that resulted in a successful bid for a$5550   million   power   project in China.   In the past five months at the BusinessDevelopment   Group   of   Enron   Broadband   Services,   I   managed   the   strategicrelationship   between   Enron   and   Microsoft.

As this report contains the same information as the Rick Buy report, I suggested to Ted that we stop duplicating work and simply use this report.The report is usually produced on Monday mornings UK time, so should be ready when the Rick gets in the office.People to contact wrt co-ordination are, Michael Kass or his superior James New.Please let me know if this report will be used in this week's Rick Buy report.Homan Amiry From:   Cassandra Schultz @ ENRON   13/111/2000 19:56\t   To: Homan Amiry/LON/ECT@ECT, Jitendra Patel/Market Risk Management/LON/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Ops Weekly UpdateTed mentioned to me that you guys receive or participate or just know of some type of weekly Enron Europe update on Fridays for Sherriff??? or some top guy over there, and that Risk Operations (New/Jordan etc.) prepare a report for that update.   Meanwhile, back in Houston we (MRM) independently prepare a weekly update for Rick Buy on Thursdays.   I'd like to get a copy of the report done last week, and talk to whoever in MRM participates, if anyone does, or if it's just Ops then whoever that is.   I think Ted was thinking we could leverage off this report and maybe move Rick Buy's weekly update back a day to coincide.Do you know what I'm talking about?   Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver? I'd like to discuss after the morning meeting tomorrow if you have a minute - maybe you can also fax or e-mail the report?   Thanks,Cassandra.work 713 853 0429fax 713 646 2194\n"

I'm sorry we didn't have the opportunity to work together in any of the groups.   As you may know,   I have just completed the SAP HR Implementation Project and my current role, working for Andrea Yowman, is to maximize our investment in SAP HR. To that end, next Thursday, 9/14, two people from SAP will be here to interview non-HR managers on a new project as described below.   You have been identified as an excellent resource to participate in this effort, and I would appreciate it if you would be able to spend 1/2 hour with this team and have your admin spend another hour with them as well --- times noted below.Please let me know if you are available and willing to participate in this initiative.   It is the beginning of our ongoing relationship with SAP to develop what Enron needs, and your input is considered invaluable to this process.   Please respond with your availability at the times noted below and I will prepare a final agenda and itinerary early next week.Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort.   If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to call me at 3-0363.Thanks.Jo AnnProposed agendaWe would like to interview managers and their administrators. 9:30 - 10:000 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#1110:000 - 111:000 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#1   1:000 -   1:30 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#2 1:30 -   2:30 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#2 2:30 -   3:000 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#3 3:000 -   4:000 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#3What is this project?SAP is developing new software for managers that will be integrated with theWorkplace. It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers atall levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by theHR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughoutSAP in the U.S. and Germany.SAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get closeto our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eightSAP customers in the U.S. Enron is one of the eight companies we would liketo visit.Who do we want to interview and observe?In a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types ofmanagers.* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budgetresponsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends todelegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or smallsubsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget andpersonnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also haveproduct-planning responsibilities.* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such asaccounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but alsoinvolved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel andlower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.What can you expect during a site visit?We have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is tomeet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then escort us to ourinterviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain theirobjectives.   Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstationswhere our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/herdaily work and asking questions.   We will then spend the next hour with his/heradministrative assistant.Interviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview peoplewhere they work because often the work environment can give us a lot ofinsights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people tobe completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitiveinformation with utmost confidentiality.There will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and administrative assistants from various areas in various business units. \n"

Call Patti and ask her to schedule   a time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk about rotations.   I will look forward to it. Definitely put January 31 on your calendar for a tour of Enron Field and dinner (someplace downtown with heat --- any suggestions?).

She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.

Todd's tendency (remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the work himself.   He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself.   If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.   We have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.   If you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all of the work.   I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as the contracted hired help!

I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.   I don't know about the one month timeframe.   I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed.   It might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.   I don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly without the family.   Can we still use Todd ?   ---"

I am working on an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next day or so to confirm some time with you there.   ---Sally Barry Pearce03/13/2000 08:37 AMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Todd &amp; Things...To recap.1.

Spoke to Bernie A - Edith is going to be here for a week in the middle of Todd's month.3. I'll be in Houston w/c 8th April - lets get together then for an update. Though I believe you may be here sooner than that?4. Astros' - any chance of tickets for Wed 10th (v St Louis). I guess - to be extra cheeky - can I have 4 - to take Jo and kids?

I was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at that point.   Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week: review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the issue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change systems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&amp;l, new activity p&amp;l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of books on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring processAlso I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at same time - more for information on this   - because when we 'solve' market risk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure reporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this to replicate, if appropriate,   an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (you and I can   review early in the week what we are doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) Would defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues trying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is MetalsI would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on Wednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for Metals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be the presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December. discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input   on how to continually improve the process), Would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, self assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a small group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome some more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be successful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your 'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPRAs explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the implementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross prioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark and Fernley on this would be useful do some planning with you for the February 12 &amp; 13 ASE - certainly in calendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! ) discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London   - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of   mid and back office services - The below is a section of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I would like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence of vision/strategy documentation for CLLead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note this is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-Changing Market practicescreate cashflow messaging within each transactioncreate payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and liquidation re-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes to terms of tradeModule/Application developmentsSynergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation together )elimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic messaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of payment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement   ) and at liquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement ) In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you think would be beneficial.   Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.   I will also spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.   And I plan to meet with Fernley as well.   Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?   Can I suggest we also cover Remote offices with Naomi ConnellThe ledger control process - similarities and differences with HoustonStatic reference control processes - ( Global Counterparties/Companies/Contracts/Facilities etc )Themes from our business process reengineering reviews prior to Christmas - similar to bottom up Op risk assessmentA gap analysis for the risk management team - explaining the 'legacy' work that James New has been leading on Our plans for EAS in Europe I shall call to discuss / prioritise and then I can instruct Fiona to organise meetingsMike I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday - as above but would you also be available for dinner with the controllers and Fernley ?\n"

James and I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting this changeThe revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve input validation processes on trade date.Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to deliverOfficialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( Houston 4 AM )Flash p&amp;l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( Houston 111AM )James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in delivering a trade date control process.I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.RegardsMike---",

We are today implementing a flash P&amp;L process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start today with the P&amp;L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston.   I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most serious problem.James From:   Rick Buy   15/12/2000 21:59\t   To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: UK Submission of PositionsNeed your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, p&amp;L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD   interest rate curves before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business London.

Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be signed off by risk management before end of day.3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.   On completion, a comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be reported to technical support in the event of a failure.   The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning of the next trading day.Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each business area/valuation system for the following:a) current stateb) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/bookingc) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full commercial signoffRegardsMike Jordan, James New, Mark Pickering, John Paskin and Brian Hudson---"

But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.   ---Sally From: Karen Marshall on 03/28/20001 08:12 PMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gene Humphrey/Enron@EnronXGate, Wanda Curry/HOU/EEES@EES, Brent A Price/Enron@EnronXGate, Charlene Jackson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Christie Patrick/HOU/ECT@ECT, Loftus Fitzwater/NA/Enron@Enron, Roger Ondreko/Enron@EnronXGate, Andrea V Reed/Enron@EnronXGatecc: Kristin Gandy/NA/Enron@Enron, Gwynn Gorsuch/NA/Enron@ENRON, Elyse Kalmans/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Laura Schwartz/Corp/Enron@Enron, Bert Frazier/Enron@EnronXGate, Billy Lemmons/Corp/Enron@ENRON, eloy.garcia@bus.utexas.edu Subject: UT/Enron MBA Excellence 20001 Scholarship Winners Announced!I am pleased to announce the recipients of the 20001 University of Texas Enron MBA Excellence Scholarships:Christopher Cashman SooPang Tang Holland Brown Each student will receive $10,000 in scholarship money based on their essays, interviews and on how they exemplified the vision, values and beliefs of Enron.I have already notified   the winners, so   please join me in congratulating each one on a job well done.

As you know, the Enron Endowed scholarships are part of a $3 million gift to the school   with $1 million earmarked to endow the Enron UT MBA excellence fund.   Our scholarships are among the largest at the McCombs School of Business and it is important to seek the highest level of involvement for the selection of this prestigious award.   Because of your knowledge of the company, your   judgement and your leadership ability, I am soliciting your help again in selecting the recipients of the 20001 scholarships.   The school has submitted sixteen outstanding candidates for Enron's consideration and are confident that we are reviewing the very best out of over 1000 first year MBA students who actually applied for our scholarships.   It is now up to us to determine who the final 3 recipients of the $10,000 scholarships will be.   We are seeking the best and brightest students who exemplify the vision, values and beliefs of Enron, regardless of commitment to a career in energy.   In order to expedite the process, I am sending you   the package   with the 16 applicants for your review.   I would like to get your feedback in rank order of the top 8 candidates no later than March 16th.   After we have narrowed the pool down   to the top 8 candidates, I will contact the students and arrange for a face to face interview in Austin with the Enron team members that are able to travel to UT   to make the final selection of the winners.The school has a very tight deadline that we must comply with for the selection of candidates.   Below is a timeline of the process: March   6, 20001   - Send applications to Enron Team for reviewMarch 16, 20001 -   Reply to Karen Marshall with the ranking of the top 8 candidates based on the applicationMarch 19,   20001 - Schedule interviews on campus with Enron team and scholarship applicantsMarch 26, 20001 -   Week of March 26 students are interviewed and winners selectedMarch 29, 20001 -   Announcement of Scholarship   Winners April 16, 20001   -   Week of April 16th, schedule a small intimate luncheon with Enron executive and the scholarship winnersSept 10, 20001-   Week of Sept 10th, schedule Scholarship Award Dinner for winners and their family, the faculty, the Dean and the Enron team If your schedule does not allow you to participate in the selection process this year, please let me know immediately so that we don't miss the deadlines.

The instructions that we got from Donna were that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then on to Causey for his review.   Considering our schedules and the large number of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by Thursday at noon.   I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.   I asked Patti to make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening first.   I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training class.   We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.   I believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will pass the resumes along to you.   Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.   Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the resumes as well.   I would suggest that in the future that your team should make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the review.   The plan of passing them from one person to another is not practical,   and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.   If you are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.   If someone from you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.   Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not Analysts interviews.   Please give us organized information to react to, not simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.   All of us want to participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and organizational work.   I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being critical.   I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.   Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated \n"

When ECT became ENA, I changed my e:mail address to drop the ect reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck.   So I can see why you would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated guess on the address or referencing my old card.

Barbara counsels patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.   If you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to contact Barbara.   In addition to having been through her own battle with a brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy meeting.   I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly welcome a conversation with you.

We expect that she will remain in NICU until approx. this afternoon and it is hoped that she will be able to come home on Monday.   As Frank has probably already told you, the Surgeon could only remove 50% of the tumor.   He believes it was benign and we'll have confirmation today.   Brenda will need several MRI's and Gamma Knife therapy (radiation) treatments.   We don't know the particular demands of this therapy but, we do look forward to having it provide a long term solution.   I anticipate at this point that I will need to work from home or stay in touch from home on Monday and that I will be able to return to your good company on Tuesday.

As well as discussing putting on the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter   modules. Although they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 21-222.Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October onwards - but that may be less of a fit).How does this fit with your group?Let me know if you want to discuss this furtherTim366698\n"

We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market, user managed, tariff based calculation engine and customer expense / revenue allocation application.The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets.   The current application has gone through the following evolution:Project Definition &amp; Design documentationDatabase Design / DevelopmentUser Interface Design / DevelopmentCommunication layer (COM) Design / DevelopmentHardware requisition / Implementation (Development / Test / Production)Arthur Anderson Audit (Passed Audit review - Application meets all minimum requirements)The Major Functionality / Action Items which have been delivered to date:Security Management (Only IT Resources to have access)Event / Task Management &amp; ReportingComponent / Equations Management &amp; ReportingEstimation Generation Management &amp; ReportingCounter Party Profile Management &amp; ReportingSettlement Entity Profile Management &amp; ReportingDeal-Upload Management &amp; ReportingIntegrated Dispute Management &amp; ReportingCustomer Generation Charge Profile &amp; ReportingHistorical Data Conversion mechanism95 % of Calculation Engine Original Functional RequirementsThe Major Functionality which is under it's final steps of Development and User TestReconciliation (Exception Identification, Allocation &amp; Reporting)Settlement Entity - Settlement Statement / Invoice Parsing &amp; ReportingRemaining 5% of Calculation Engine FunctionalityOver the past 12+ months a total of $3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS.   We are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that everyone is still on board with this being OUR (Enron) Volume Management strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets.As of March 1, 20001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish.   Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the Enron Networks IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year.   These resources have been key in helping us get to where we are today.   In addition we had originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 20001 (03/20001 - 12/20001) to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West &amp; East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office.   Without a contract in place and currently working on good faith.   The project has come to a serious point of action.   Razorfish is asking for a total of $728,000 for services rendered between 3/1/20001 and 6/30/20001.   They will keep the resources dedicated to the project and will deliver the following:Finalise base product development, assist in unit / user testing and Implement base VMS Product in Production.Application Production Support for 30 Days post ImplementationTransition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to Enron Networks IT resourcesRazorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist Enron throughout the remainder of the year.   However,   I don't feel that everyone is ready to make that decision.   We do however need to make a final decision on this first implementation.As I have stated prior in this document,   \"We have accomplished a lot over the past year.\"   Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion of the VMS team.   I don't see any of us meeting our 20001 Volume Management (VM) Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical fashion.   In some cases I don't see it being possible at all.It is time to make a decision.   Do we all agree that we need to move forward and retain Razorfish services for the additional $728,000 and incur each of OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to determine who picks up the $3 MM already spent.Please provide me with your response by 5:000 PM PT to allow me to get back to Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday.Thanks - MO\n"

I am the CFO in Sydney and am currently running the settlements work done down here and I would also like to go over the results of the audit. At the moment I have time available both on Wed and Thursday and would appreciate it if we could meet up on either of those days if you are available.

I thoroughly enjoyed the week of vacation that I took before Christmas.   It was fun to be home with the children, although I certainly worked hard --- up every night until very late either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas cards.   I plan to be in the London office next week.   I will leave Houston on Sunday evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.   After a stop by the hotel, I should be in the office after lunch.   I plan to be there through Thursday, and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.   I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.   Some of the major goals for the trip are: to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same   day, to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (we are doing this in Houston   on January 111 for managers and above within Operations for EA, EGM and EIM), to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the London office who will participate in   Doorstep reviews this year,   to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPRI also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office services.   Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like for me to meet.   Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.   Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this week.   I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.   In addition, I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.   Also, if you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.   I have been in the throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to finalize my calendar for next week.   ---Sally \n"

The attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.   The meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 222 at 1:30pm in EB33321.The purpose of this meeting is :1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might derail the closing of the deal, and2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global accounting issues, and3) To create/maintain a \"Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet\" comprised of Wholesale's Top Ten critical dealsThe meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting (i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).   I believe Wes still plans to hold a Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.

If this is the best time to put that in writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.   If there is an efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, then that would be great.   It simply helps put the London initiative in the context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.   ---Sally Mike Jordan09/27/2000 02:58 AMTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts on the cover note ?   Comments in red \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   Sally Beck   26/09/2000 23:57 To: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECTcc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts on the cover note ?   I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.   On the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.   Is there an article to be included in an Enron publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)?   Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?   ( Yes - apologies if there is confusion )With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities.   With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide.   These global standards also should enable Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations.   I am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.   Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity to work on this with you and Shona )Finally, a question regarding timing.   The last I knew after you and Brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) for comments to all business controllers.   I don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.   And not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards.   My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have that global report in production by the end of the year.   There is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.   Shona has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has already been working with James New.   So I question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.   Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?   Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to ShonaSorry that this response looks so long.   I have been interrupted 20 times while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.   Thanks for sharing this with me.

      "body": "\nNot too mountainous, but I am sure that would be fun.   It's kind of hard to fly to Bermuda from Texas.   Easy from New York, but not that much traffic between Houston/Austin and there.   A few years ago when we went with David's family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.   I think that our round trip from Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.   Hopefully we could arrange something like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that could be tough.   Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or three and rank them?   Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, etc. to see what would be most feasible.   Or should we research a few places and present those choices for them to consider?   What do you think?   Seems like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.   And what do you and Cara envision --- a weekend, a few days, a week?   Our kids will get out of school on Friday, May 25.   The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.   We are having a great year here at Enron, especially in the business unit that I am in.   Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early February.   I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for everyone.   \"Cindy White\" &lt;cwhite@viviance.com&lt; on 08/25/2000 10:28:04 AMTo: \"Sally\" &lt;sally.beck@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: anniversaryJust talked to Cara who talked to Mom about the anniversary trip---Carathinks she wants Bermuda...\n"

I have a preference for Western mountains --- big, open sky   (Grand Tetons could be great), but if Mom pictures North Carolina as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.   We were in Ashville a couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.   We stayed at a place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.   I am sure that there are other places in the area to research.   There may also be some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.   I think that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around and see if there are any good suggestions.   In magazines, I have seen pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains) that look nice.   I will see if I can find the names of those places.

We might spend one night or two - plan somethingfun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dadwith champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just gosomewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a morespecial (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in SanFrancisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - butprovide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Momand Dad would still get to go someplace fun.

I found the name of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.   Another place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.   Both meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.   I will get info on both and we can look at it.   I worry a little bit about having such a range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is plenty to do for all --- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc.   These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough variety.   I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the whole family.   One of those might catch their interest as well. I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the thought of this trip could wear thin.   I would like the opportunity to be together with everyone --- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!   Even though Dad is doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get everyone together on a trip like this.

I've been meaning to call you for several days - but it's been abit of a madhouse, so I thought I might fire off an e-mail:I don't know if you've talked with Cindy in the past few days - but, if it'sokay with you, I'd like to decline your very sweet offer of having a babyshower.   Here's the deal:   A couple of friends had already offered to doone - and I'm having trouble coming up with a vibrant mix of people to splitamongst two showers.This seems to be a good decision for Cindy, too, since may be a bit short ofcash and energy right now.However, I would LOVE for you to come to the one shower - if it's convenientfor you.   I would love for you to meet my friends, and for them to meet you!If it doesn't work for you, I'll certainly understand - especially since youmay want to come again when baby is born.   But, if you'd like to considercoming, I'd like to know your schedule.   We're talking about a weekend lunchor afternoon thing I think.   In January or February, I\"m available on thefollowing weekends:Jan. 20Jan. 27Feb. 17Feb. 24.I think going any later than this might be cutting it close!   What I needfrom you is to know which of these weekends you might be available.   The\"shower planners\" are getting eager to plan.

It will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.   Yes, the bed and changing table match --- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table.   Our bedding could probably go either way, boy or girl.   If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim.   It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a look when you are here.   We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for you to look at and a great baby swing.   As the baby gets older, we also have an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.   I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them.   Yes, good news on Dad.   I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement.   It is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.   It is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.   I think that he dodged a bullet on this one.   We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.   No big plans yet.   I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.   I have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November birthdays that evening.   Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).   I will have the whole week off from work.   The kids are off starting on Wednesday.   It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.

I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs. psychiatrist.

I believe that she and Dad will each see a counselor type on Tuesday this week.   I hope that they will begin to find some relief.   Sounds as if they are really having a hard time - at least Mom.

They arereally TINY gold studs, in the shape of very gold hearts.   Does that soundright?   (She said she has silver ones just like them but wants gold.)   Ifthose are the ones, I'll have those sent to her.Hope you had a good weekend.   We had a social one - friends over for drinkson Friday (we have christened the bucket, by the way!); dinner party onSaturday; babtism/brunch on Sunday . . . I pulled up Enron's web site theother day and printed out an article about the company just for fun -thought I should learn more about it.   Interesting stuff.   Love, C. \n"

Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was thinking!!!   Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 222 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and add a study hall.   She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which is probably exactly what she needs.   I was prepared to go all the way to the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily I didn't have to go that far.   Hope that you have a good weekend!

Like Mary Gosnell, I've been alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.   Coincidently, the application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, so it looks like there is an Enron element connecting the two of cases together.   I've called the director of security and Enron's in-house police officer (who works from the Enron building M/W/F).   Security is looking into churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's a leak.Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data Management.Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the country and have no established credit rating...I have taken the appropriate action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.Thanks,Avril\n"

This memo serves to convey our deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 8am meeting)7:45 - 2:000 - preparation of the violation/notification memos2:000 - finalization of the DPR &amp; memosIn order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to meet the following deadlines (Houston time):before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)4:000 (London):   officialization and sending of feeds to IT7:20 (all): export of preliminary information7:20-3:000: support on explanations of violations/notification memos111:000 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for Merchant Asset group)12:000 (Houston only): export of final information Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.   Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.   Remember, the DPR cannot go out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the whole process.Thank you,Shona Wilson\n"

Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.   I set my last date of work for Friday, May 111.   Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of days until Meagan was born.   With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.   She was a week late, so we just didn't know what to expect.   Tyler's due date was December 18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.   Of course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.   A lot of this probably depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have everything at the house ready.   I still had a lot of energy at the end of my pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed working as long as I could.

      "body": "\nAlong with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst Program at the University of Oklahoma.   We became involved in recruiting there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.   OU transformed their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management Program in the School of Business.   This undergraduate degree retains the geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a trading floor course.   With the added plus of many of these students growing up in or around \"energy\" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.   Our recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy Management graduates have done well at Enron.   Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody Crook.   He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 graduation.   His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book administrator in gas trading.   He is in the process of looking for a second rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you should consider for a rotation on your team.   In addition to this last year's risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for Burlington Resources.   I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.   I think very highly of him, and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program.   His background and your business seem to be a good fit.   Please visit with Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.   It will be well worth your time.   Thanks.   ---Sally   x35926 \n"

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in place at 31 Dec 2000 when Enron Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: MGMR and Bergman.   Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was level 2 (below average controls).   We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)   or 5 (excellent) in each case,   along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.   The revised controls assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our progress.   If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will organise.Many thanksNaomi \n"

While room for this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.   By being within the same elevator bank, we can now employ \"squawk\" boxes between the traders and this scheduling team.

Best in Category awards are given for each category of team dance entered, regardless of school size.   Klein won best in category for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean sweep.   Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first place in the duet category.   Also won first place in officer dances for super sized schools.   They also won two special judges awards - not given out every time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.   They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 1000 awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).   The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).   The girls were pretty excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.   They all work so hard and spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!!I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines sometime.

When I asked if he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.   His read is that she is very bright, creative, and innovative.   She has worked on many special projects at Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist role as she learned Enron and would then \"earn\" her way into managing special projects.

Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail.   We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these players away.   Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our competitor, which will require that he have good people.   He will be moving to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.   He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or childless, their mobility factors could be high.   Enron would not want to lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.   ---"

As we could miss new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak time.Regan Smith, x39291Manager, Unify AccountingUnify/ SAP Interface\n"

I work with members of her group and we have successfully managed to take care of trader's wishes for more flexibility related to logging in one time and having the trades mapped to the appropriate system depending on commodity traded.   The process is still taken care of through 'back-screen' programming and in my opinion should be easier to apply to all traders with cross-commodity portfolios.   The only one on one contact I have had with Sheri was to request that Power Risk be involved in the approval process when a trader was requesting an EOL login id.   There have been instances when traders will get set up on EOL but have not been set up in Enpower.   When this happens their transaction will not bridge because there is no place for them to go as Enpower has no way of recognizing them as a trader.   Sheri talked to one of her group members and had them include myself and my leads (for back-up) into the approval process of EOL trader setup.She was understanding and responsive to my request.   I do not feel that I have had the appropriate exposure to her work to give her a formal rating, but I wanted to share the minimal experience I have had for your reviewal process.Stacey\n"

I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off chance that you might be in Houston at that time.   It would be fun for all of us to get together.   I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, who was on his first day here.   We could also schedule a First City reunion if you could be here.   If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects for a lunch or happy hour.

Big push, after an over percentage completion rate of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.   Some of those unfinished reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).   I wrote three last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:000 am and gave all three reviews this morning.   I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver tomorrow morning to be at 1000%.   I will try to call you on my way into the office tomorrow morning from the car.   If I miss you then, it will be late afternoon Houston time before I could call you.   Next week shapes up to be MUCH better.   I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.   Would love to have to over here and involved in operations.

Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 5000 employees in the Enron building.   Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?

Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 5000 employees in the Enron building.   Do you want all of them to choose one of the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this segment of Net Works?

Also, given the fact that operations is a relative \"newcomer\" to Enron Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   ---Sally ---",

While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our commercialization effort.   They are not in the habit of considering the 5000 people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.   Floor meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and yet my group has added over 5000 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with our reorganization late last fall.   I will diligently work with Philippe and Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key Enron businesses that we support.   I suspect that motivating and managing in this environment will become increasingly challenging.   This is an FYI more than anything else.   ---Sally   ---"

The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page &amp; home #'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information for every pipe we do business on.   The schedulers were also instructed to call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and cell #'s.If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a pipeline of market emergency could occur. Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob---",

Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible for much of what we achieved.As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss whether Todd would be available come over.Thanks and regards James\n"

I don't know about the one month timeframe.   I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed.   It might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.   I don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly without the family.   Can we still use Todd ?   ---"

      "body": "\nBrent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday morning and returning to Houston on Friday.   The purpose of my visit is in regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has hired.   Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.   We will also map out an Enron trading operations introduction   for Michael Jordan, which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.   My goal is to provide a strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as possible.   Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his   business controllers   to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we would commit to for 2000.   I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron locations with trading operations.   My earlier trips to London this year were focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on leveraging worldwide operations experience.   I value input from other trading operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.   I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as she moves into her role in Global Products.   I have not heard   from Tani, but I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.   It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.   I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role over Global Products.   I trust that she will contact me for that support as needed.   I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your business efforts in London.   I look forward to meeting with you next week.   This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.   There will be a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.   The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a large ownership position.   It is likely that the continuation of this effort in London will occur in mid April.   Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.   We hope to finalise those drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.   Fernley suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.   The Sydney and Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip in London with regard to support for SIngapore.   The Houston team returned the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.   I can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was out of the office last week).   We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.   They understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.   \n"

Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be signed off by risk management before end of day.3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.   On completion, a comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be reported to technical support in the event of a failure.   The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning of the next trading day.Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each business area/valuation system for the following:a) current stateb) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/bookingc) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full commercial signoffRegardsMike Jordan, James New, Mark Pickering, John Paskin and Brian Hudson---",

We'll see in a few days if this helped on contributions.   Text of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the United Way.   I was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused   Houston children and   the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents.   I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center.   Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge.   Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit organizations.   Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year.   The United Way campaign is the one time each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in Houston.   Each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by Enron.   If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing so as soon as possible.   Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next Wednesday, August 23.   I hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge.   There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.   Log on to http:///unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic pledge.   \n"

It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim Fallon.   The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.   May be the end of this week, may be next week.   I think it will still be good for you and Kristin to talk in person.   Kristin and Todd are both very qualified and you would love working with both.   Kristin's established working relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.   I don't want to lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same time.   So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.   I got your message on housing/location in Houston.   I am headed out of the office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.   I will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some options on housing.   \n"

On Thursday, we discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we had found that were \"show stoppers\" as far as releasing the product for Beta Testing.

Today during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.   I talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.   She said that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.   We plan more testing in the morning.They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to introduce the module.   They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to postponed further.We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were comfortable that the items that we identified were working.

      "body": "\nToday was the final ENA PRC.   Relative ranking results up through the Senior Director level are final.   You and your management team can begin the process of giving performance reviews to your employees.   I spoke with Sheila Walton today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting the employee reviews.   She indicated that the target completion date should be the end of July.   Promotions will be effective August 1st.   It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.   This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.   I will keep you updated on this as I get direction from him.   Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.   In order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups who will be giving performance reviews.   It is important to note, however, that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view of that employee's relative ranking.   In other words, an employee in the Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.   Also please note the following: Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given to the employees.   This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with the relative performance of that employee.   (This has been the stated process for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process as well.)Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced members of your management team, or those management team members where you have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and perhaps tough performance feedback.   I believe that we have spent some time in identifying these situations.   I ask your help to ensure that we follow through on this commitment.   Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a meaningful one.   It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0\n"

They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.   I have provided copies of your accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey for reference during that process.   Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be completed before the end of July.   I will schedule an August date with you for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.   Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact course that is required of VP's.   I thought that the course was very good.   All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.   It is a 2 or 3 day course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.   I would contact Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.   \n"

Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).   If you would prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from December 20-23 while I am on vacation.   My home number is 281-370-8568.   I will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 1)   January 1:   Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all systems to give you a status update?   I can leave a voice mail for you at your Enron number.   Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you will provide me with a number where you will be.   Cliff Baxter and several key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we trade in North America.   I will make these phone calls myself, and will naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.   Please let me know your preference for notification.   2)   Definition of a global focus for trading operations:   Attached is a draft memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.   This memo describes a coordination role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that should be coordinated in all trading locations.   Please let me and/or Rick know if you have any comments or suggestions.   I had hoped to briefly discuss this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:   (1) This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the needs of ENA.   I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control and service in ENA operations.   Through that hard work, I believe that I have your confidence in my ability to deliver results.   I   would do nothing to jeopardize that.   (2)   There is a need for this coordination function, and some one will play that role.   If I play that role, I can be in the best position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.   3)   Gas Logistics:   I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants logistics to report to him.   His stated reason to me is that he wants it to \"look like power\".   I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what   the criteria should be on which we make that decision.   I will propose to Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable information about the pipes and capacity.   ( We have that now for the Central and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is built out for gas.)   I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and West regions.   Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.   Without a continuing focus in logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our ability to deliver our projected cost savings.   I also believe that Brent will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.   While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 19996 when we had an earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding logistics accountable for their part in this.   I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on this issue.   \n"

I will try to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.   I start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 to about 7:15. I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.   I don't think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of June 27.   Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?   I have scheduled dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the trip.   Just let me know.   Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?   Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG acquisition.   That should make life fun for you!   I wanted to talk about resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence efforts and longer term in the assimilation.   As in my voice mail, I believe that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they run their business.   It seems that might help jump start the plans around how best to assimilate the business.   I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and in other locations.   Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell   who seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.   We can hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.   \n"

It was fun to be home with the children, although I certainly worked hard --- up every night until very late either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas cards.   I plan to be in the London office next week.   I will leave Houston on Sunday evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.   After a stop by the hotel, I should be in the office after lunch.   I plan to be there through Thursday, and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.   I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.   Some of the major goals for the trip are: to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of London books to same   day, to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts (we are doing this in Houston   on January 111 for managers and above within Operations for EA, EGM and EIM), to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the London office who will participate in   Doorstep reviews this year,   to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPRI also plan to visit with Mike on the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London and his thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around potential commercialization of mid and back office services.   Mike also has some members of the London team that he would like for me to meet.   Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.   Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this week.   I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.   In addition, I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.

Would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed.   However, in my role over Global Risk Management Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.   Brent Price, who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping me updated on progress to date.   His return soon to Houston, however, will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill.   Thanks in advance to your attention to this.   \n"

This meeting has been replaced by the Wholesale Deal Meeting to be held at the same time and location.   The attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.   The meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 222 at 1:30pm in EB33321.The purpose of this meeting is :1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might derail the closing of the deal, and2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global accounting issues, and3) To create/maintain a \"Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet\" comprised of Wholesale's Top Ten critical dealsThe meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting (i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).   I believe Wes still plans to hold a Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.
