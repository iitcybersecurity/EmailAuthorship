      "body": "\nThe Following are our   recommended changes to the agreement( I would also like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you):Page 2, item (3) should read \"The payment of a \"project fee\" of $175,000 upon the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.Item (4) should read \"The payment of a \"project fee\" equal to 2% of the project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in Exhibit B to this letter.Exhibit A should read as follows:Individual milestones subject to \"project fee\" payments:1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. (\"Haywood Power\"), the abandonment by the Tennessee Valley Authority (\"TVA\") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of its Haywood County, Tennessee facility (\"Lagoon Creek\"), which results in Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 5000kV open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement.2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of $5 million.   Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the $175,000 project fee shall be paid.3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. (\"Calvert\"), the elimination of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 5000kV transmission line from Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Calvert.Exhibit B should read as follows:The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a \"Development Project\"). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively   to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be deemed to be an approved Development Project (an \"Approved Project\"). For purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an Approved Project as defined herein.   \n"

Two weeks ago I met with the Mayor and City Attorney on the Mayor's political business and they told me of their concern about the future of Azurix.   They wanted some assurance from Ken or Jeff that Azurix would be around as a part of Enron if it were awarded the Northeast Water Plant Project.   I believe they had some communications with Azurix officials but they really wanted to hear from someone at Enron.I sent the word back to Enron through Joe, that someone high up should contract the Mayor and the City Attorney to give them whatever assurance they could concerning their concerns. I believe Joe discussed this with Steve.Last Wednesday night I saw the Mayor and asked him if his request through me had any results.   Had he heard from Enron?   He said no, and that he needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix.I assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my conversation I would think we need to give some communication to the Mayor from someone high up in the Enron organization.George\n"

Apparently these were   on CNN.   These are the same positions we an=\rd=20\rthe\rInvestors Group have been discussing with government officials.=20\r=20\r The second article is on the rationing situation which will result in cuts=\r=20\rof over 20%\rover the next 6 months.\r We are preparing a summary of the impacts on our business for discussion=20\rwith =20\ryou this week.\r   AES Suspends Brazil Investments\rUS-based power company AES Corp. has put on hold plans to invest between\rUS$2 billion and US$2.5 billion on energy projects in Brazil, alleging that=\r=20\rthe\rgovernment=01,s policy on pricing is jeopardizing its operations.\rAES President Dennis Bakke, on a brief visit to Brazil, said the company\rsuspended indefinitely its plans to build as many as 10 thermoelectric powe=\rr\rplants.\rBakke criticized Brazil's electricity sector regulator Aneel for maintainin=\rg=20\ran\renergy policy that charged what Bakke said were ```unrealistically low price=\rs=20\rfor\rconsumers,''' forcing AES to carry the burden of rising costs.\rHe said investments would remain on hold until the government came up with\ra solution.\rAES has already invested US$6 billion in Brazil, primarily in electricity\rprojects, making it one of the country's top private foreign investors.\r Energy Blackouts To Begin June 1\rThe government announced Tuesday that it will begin a policy of programmed\rblackouts starting June 1 as part of its energy rationing plan.\rMines and Energy Ministry officials had at first hoped to delay any blackou=\rts\runtil August, concentrating first on a program to induce consumers to reduc=\re\renergy use. The critical level of reservoirs in the country=01,s main=20\rhydroelectric\rplants, however, forced Tuesday=01,s decision to accelerate the blackouts w=\rhich=20\rwill\rlast until the end of November when the rainy season begins.\rThe blackouts will occur in the Southeast, Central-West and Northeast regio=\rns\rof the country. At the same time the government will introduce a program=20\rproviding\rincentives to consumers to reduce their energy use. The goal of the plan is=\r=20\rto lower\relectricity consumption by 20%.\rAlthough the general outline of the rationing plan was announced Tuesday, t=\rhe\rdetails have yet to be worked out due to differences between the government\rministers who compose the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). A new\rmeeting of CNPE was set for May 23 by which time it is hoped that an agreem=\rent\rwill have been reached on how to implement the plan.\rThe initial proposal from Mines and Energy was for a 15% reduction for\rindustry, 20% for residences and between 18% and 20% for commerce. The\rministries of finance, planning and development, however, asked for more ti=\rme=20\rto\rconsider the impact of the energy cuts.\rThe principal concern among government officials is with the impact on the\reconomy of the proposed blackouts. According to a study to be released toda=\ry=20\rby\rthe Get?lio Vargas Foundation, a 20% energy cut would slow economic growth =\rby\r1.5% of gross domestic product and would have a direct impact on 850,000 jo=\rbs.\rProduction costs for industry would rise 1.5%, government tax receipts woul=\rd\rdecline by R$6.6 billion (US$2.9 billion) and Brazil=01,s trade deficit wou=\rld=20\rincrease\rby US$1.6 billion, according to the study. The study=01,s authors also said=\r=20\rthere was\rno guarantee that the effects of the program would be limited to this year.\rBusiness leaders reacted with apprehension to the prospect of obligatory\rblackouts. Most defended a policy of separate reduction goals for each=20\rindustrial\rsector, sparing industries that depend heavily on electricity. The S?o Paul=\ro=20\rState\rFederation of Industries (Fiesp) said that sectors who are major consumers =\rof\renergy such as steel should be exempted from any rationing.\rWhile details were lacking in the government=01,s plan, officials said that=\r the\radministration of the energy cuts would be placed in the hands of local=20\rutilities\rwhich would determine the locations and schedules for daily blackouts.=20\rAccording\rto national energy secretary Afonso Henriques, a 20% reduction in consumpti=\ron\rwould amount to a cut of six hours a day.\r   \n"
