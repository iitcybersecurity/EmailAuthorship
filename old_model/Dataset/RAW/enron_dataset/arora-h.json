Philippe would like to arrange 3 or 4 bidders to compete in a live, online DealBench auction.   He mentioned that you would be in charge of contacting Compaq, NEC and the other suppliers of these displays and would be the primary Enron person involved in this procurement (I'm estimating it at a $2 to $4 million contract).I wanted to offer to have one of our Marketing professionals spend some time with you to walk through a sample auction to make sure you are comfortable with our platform and that we can meet all your live auctioning needs.   Please give me a call at 3-5629 when you have a minute to discuss.   If you want to arrange a demo, please contact Vanessa Carranza (3-5030).thanks,JeffJeffrey M.

Of course, I do see the area for contractors, however, I was curious what these classifications are.   Can you please let me know what these are?New Power Company/Azurix/EDS EmployeesI just want to be sure on the correct fees prior to making a commitment to join with them.   Also, have you ever been to the Body Shop in the morning?   Do you know if it is super crowded or not?   I can't imagine too many people arriving at 5:30am.Thanks ahead for your input.
