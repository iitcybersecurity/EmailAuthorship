AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the people of Houston.   Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.   These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .   (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 111:30 a.m. - 1:000 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.   Tickets are not required for the lawn area.   About CoppeliaCopp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: \"Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.\"Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 19992 featuring breathtaking d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, \"It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.\"   (The Houston Post, March 21, 19992)Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe --- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in   the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.\n"

They have agreed to raise allocations by 8000 MB/D on aprorata basis beginning October 1st. The increase is until the next meetingwhich will be November 12th in Vienna. This rather early data was chosenbecause of the already scheduled Producer/Consumer Dialogue in Saudi ArabiaNovember 17-19 and the beginning of Ramadan religious observance beginningNovember 27th and lasting for approximately one month. The price band andOPEC output response mechanism (20 consecutive business days above $28/BBBLbasket price, increase output 5000 MB/D, 10 consecutive days below $222/BBBLbasket, decrease 5000 MB/D) will remain in effect with obviously a cleanslate to start the price tracking process.Saudi Arabia pretty much got its way at the meeting, asking for a 1 MMB/Dincrease and compromising on 8000 MB/D. Of course the increase is proratawhich implies an increase in the Saudi allocation of 260 MB/D, bringing itstotal allocation to about 8.5 MMB/D. Saudi crude output is estimated to havebeen almost 8.8 MMB/D in August(including 140 MB/D Abu Safa output producedon behalf of Bahrain). PIRA expects Saudi Arabia's crude output increase tobe on top of its current over-production bringing total output to nearly 9.1MMB/D. Since with the exception of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all the OPECmembers are essentially at capacity, the 8000 MB/D OPEC allocation increaseshould translate into a production increase of only around 4000 MB/D. SaudiArabia and the UAE have allocations equal to 41.2% of the OPEC total(now26.2 MMB/D excluding Iraq).   With August/September OPEC crude output ataround 29 MMB/D, fourth quarter crude output will be around 29.5 MMB/Dassuming Iraq at 3.0 MMB/D.MARKET BACKGROUNDCommercial oil inventories remain quite low with the three major OECDmarkets---U.S., Europe and Japan--- ending August with the lowest level inover 10 years. PIRA would not be surprised to see inventories revised upsomewhat for Europe for the end of the second quarter, but this will notmaterially change the likely end August position.In addition to low inventories, the world is operating with very littlespare producing capacity. With OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D in the fourthquarter, there will only be some 0.5 to 1.0 MMB/D of instant spare producingcapacity remaining. This number will certainly increase in time, but for atleast the first half of the fourth quarter there is not much room for anyinterruption in expected supply for any reason (hurricanes, Iraq saberrattling, earthquakes, etc).Also, the lead seasonal product distillate(gasoil/diesel) is in great shapeand with substantial refining margins there is plenty of headroom for crude.Add to the mix very low PADD II crude stocks, positive technicals andseasonals, at most only ten million barrels of current net speculativelength in the NYMEX crude contract and continued strong economic growth andyou have rather impressive positives for price.SHORT TERM MARKET BALANCES &amp; PRICESWith fourth quarter OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D, world onshore oilinventories should draw only 1000-2000 MB/D in the quarter. Thus assumingnormal early winter weather, stocks will remain very low but not, onaverage, decline significantly. For the three major OECD markets, commercialinventories should end the year 1-2% above the year earlier.In these circumstances and given the very positive market factors notedabove, it is hard to see oil prices taking a big hit downward as a result ofthe OPEC agreement. PIRA would expect the very initial market reaction to benegative given that the agreed increase is somewhat more than anticipated.The market will then probably consolidate given that there is a good deal ofconfusion about the impact of the agreement. Given the current very strongfundamentals an upward price bias is likely to quickly return. However, onemajor wildcard negative for price first needs to be sorted out.THE POTENTIAL U.S. SPR SWAPIf the United States is going to use the SPR to swap current barrels fromthe strategic reserve to be replaced in the future, the market will find outthis week. With the U.S. Presidential election on November 7th, Octoberpipeline scheduling completion on September 25th and probably ten days tocarry out an auction, this is the last window of opportunity to have ameaningful impact before the onset of winter and the election. With SPRbarrels being short haul, as opposed to 45 days away for any incrementalOPEC oil, its impact on oil prices would be far greater than OPEC's currentagreement. Moreover, if the decision is made to use the reserve in thisfashion, the Secretary of Energy is likely to decide to make sure it has thedesired impact of bringing prices down substantially by offering to swapvery substantial volumes. PIRA rates the odds of a swap at 555%.\n"

The change will result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.000 puts) - which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index -1.000 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to reflect the difference in strikes.If   anyone has any questions please call me at   3-6731.Thank You,Larry May\n"
