He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no value for either of the deals.

Mike originally entered this deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should have been Cal'03-Cal'04. So we changed it, and it must have messed up the strips somehow. Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good enough for me.Thanks again,Kate \n"

I'll try to drop you a line tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold of you, but I had no idea where to look.

Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.   We=\r=20\rwant you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=\r =20\rPlease spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=\r=20\rand our position on California energy issues.\r What happened in California\r The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=\rly=20\rand demand.   California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 19998.   This incr=\reased=20\rthe demand for electricity by 24 percent.   At the same time, regulatory=20\rrestrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.   So=\r=20\rdemand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.   The resul=\rt,=20\rpredictably, is a shortage.   This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20\rpercent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.\r In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=\r=20\rfactors that led to the current crisis.   First, the state=01,s regulations=\r=20\rforced all sales and purchases into the spot market.   The spot market for=\r=20\rpower is extraordinarily volatile.   The way firms behave in a free market=\r=20\rwhen faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=\rng=20\rterm, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.   I=\rn=20\rCalifornia, state regulation prevented this strategy.   This would be the=20\requivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=\re=20\rmost volatile interest rate environment imaginable.   Everything was fine=20\rwhile the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=\rt=20\rwas purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.\r Second, retail markets were not deregulated.   Regulated retail rates remain=\red=20\rin effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20\rcompetition out.   This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=\rle=20\rprices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20\rregulated retail rate.   They are now nearly bankrupt.\r In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=\rion. =20\rRegulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=\r=20\rgeneration from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=\r=20\rspot prices.\r At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=\r=20\rthe state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=\rhich,=20\rif adopted, would have averted the current crisis.\r Enron=01,s Role\r Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=\rix=20\rthe problem.   Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20\rpoliticians and the media.   Here are the facts:\r ? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=\r=20\rstate of California.   Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=\r=20\rsame market available to other California purchasers.   Because we are a=20\rmarket maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.   We ar=\re=20\rinterested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=\rts=20\rfor our customers.\r? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=\r=20\rthe problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.   We=\r=20\rprotected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.\r You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20\rpower directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=\r=20\rthe open market.   Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&amp;turnback=018=\r of our=20\rcustomers to the utilities.   Here are the facts:\r ? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20\rmarket, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=\rly=20\rfrom the utilities.   This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20\rallowing EES to access lower utility rates.\r? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =\rto=20\rreceive the financial benefits of their contract prices.\r? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=\r=20\rwith other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20\rreducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.\r Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=\r=20\rcrisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20\rcontinues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=\r=20\rpower markets.   Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=\rers=20\rwith solutions customized to meet their needs.   There has never been more=\r=20\rdemand for our products and services.\r The Solution\r The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.   In summary=\r, the=20\rstate must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=\ret=20\rand shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.\r Increasing Supply\r California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=\r=20\rshort of Byzantine.   Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=\rs=20\rthan a year.   In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.   California simpl=\ry=20\rmust streamline this process.   Ironically, while many of the regulations=20\rgenerators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=\r=20\rregulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20\rdisplacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.   California can=\r=20\rhave abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20\rfacilities.\r Reducing Demand\r Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =\r=20\rThey pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.   An open retail=\r=20\rmarket would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=\rd=20\rat lower prices than today.   California should fully open its retail market=\r.\r Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market\r In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20\rvolatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=\r=20\rterm, fixed-price basis.   The state has instead left procurement in the han=\rds=20\rof the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=\r. =20\rOpening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=\rir=20\rprice risk.\r Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions\r The utilities in California are not paying their bills.   This has led to=20\rgreater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=\r=20\rarrive at lasting solutions.   California must permit its utilities to recov=\rer=20\rtheir costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=\r=20\rdistribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=\r=20\rneeded.\r Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=\r,=20\rwhile politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=\r=20\rworse.   Price caps have been proposed.   They don=01,t work; have never work=\red;=20\rand they will not work here.   Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=\r,=20\rwhich then have to be allocated among competing users.   Imagine how=20\rineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =\rit=20\ris better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=\rey=20\ror Silicon Valley.   Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20\rshortage worse.\r The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20\rCalifornia.   There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=\r=20\rthe state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20\rconstructing, operating and maintaining assets.   This will also result in=\r=20\rCalifornia tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20\rgeneration --- which the private sector can do --- instead of education, road=\rs=20\rand other public goods --- which the private sector cannot do.\r As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=\rhe=20\rcrisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:   We at Enron=\r will=20\rcontinue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20\rsolutions to the state. \n"

Please let me know if this plan suits you - 1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.Kate \n"

I will talk with Nicolay Kraltchev, the Houston IT guy in charge of fixing it, on Friday, Dec. 222. It should be up and running again by Friday afternoon.

Hey, one thing I probably did not clarify to you yesterday on was that when the new deal ticket was set up for the $140 price strip (Deal #576468.1), the deal should only be in for (4/6/20001) according to APX's statement (not including 4/7/20001).

A few times over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk have entered off peak deals by choosing the \"off\" selection under the \"Hours\" heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and Holidays, round-the-clock hours.My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them in Deal Entry.Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure either way.Thanks for your time,Kate\n"

He killed 571920 and kept 571801, but the trade was actually for Cal'03. (Is everyone still with me?) So I restored 571920 and killed 571801 to reverse what he had done. But in my rush just before your calc last night I neglected to look at the volumes of the deal I was restoring, which incidently had been zeroed out, thus leaving Mike with no value for either of the deals.

A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals. 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when \"Desk to Desk\" is selected. 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done cross portfolio.I don't think \"both sides\" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our sale when we query for our point.

      "body": "\nI'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on for the past few weeks. Also, deal 4984888 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. Am I missing something?As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do their jobs - do you know anything about that?I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised.

Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the index prices in order to run one of her reports.I'm wondering if it   would be possible to give these people access to your database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you.

Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones daily index price. And that's the long and short of it. The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:Participant List   NP-15 Purchases   NP-15 Sales   Reported NP-15 Purchases Reported NP-15 SalesSempra   Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250   Avista - $270   Sempra - $250Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260   Duke - $260Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270   Avista - $270Now that's simple!Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.

Here is the error message it gives me:Cannot create file c:\\eolJF.txt.It responds this way no matter what combination of requests I give it. One interesting detail is that it began doing this on 12/21, the night before I left for vacation (thus my delay in dealing with this problem), and on that same night I noticed that the report looked different than usual. Actually, it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today. It had the new section at the bottom titled \"Uncheck 'Desk Summary Only' to enable\"; whereas the version I had been using did not.Our IT guys deferred to you on this subject, so I'm still at a loss as to how to test the new stage version of the EOL report, as I have nothing to test it against. My feeling is that, even though the new version has a few quirks, it would be better than nothing and so should be put into production - because in the meantime I'm going to have to use it anyway - it's all I have now!Thank you so much for your support on this so far.

It was extended for HE 9 through 222 at a price of $160. In the spreadsheet Real Time sends to EES each day, it shows the deal as a sale at a price of $130, not a buy at a price of $160.   My first instinct was to simply modify the spreadsheet to match the deal in Enpower, but EES claims they see the price coming across as $130.

      "body": "\nKate SymesStudent No. 56943066681. The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for potatoes - that is, the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward. This would result in an increase in price, and a corresponding increase in supply. As the supply curve comes up to meet the new, higher demand curve, we would actually see an increase in overall demand, supply, AND price. The statement is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price.2. a. The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is 8 bottles of soda.b. I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B, because they both allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction.c. Bundle E must include about 216 bottles of soda in order to make me indifferent between it and bundle D. This follows from the logic that, when I have 1000 bottles of soda, it would take about 8 more to make me give up one bottle of beer in the bundle. Here I have 2000 bottles of soda - I would need AT LEAST 8 bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle with the same frequency of use.3. Firstly, this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs associated with flying. Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the highway, and you might find more families taking road trips on their next vacation. This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could actually increase injuries and fatalities - secondary because it would not be directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes, but because it would incent people to find other, possibly more dangerous, modes of transportation.4. Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as safe as possible while still maintaining a profit. It also narrows consumers' choice sets when buying a new car. A person buying a car in a country with no auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision. In a country indoctrinated by Nader's book, the choice between whether to buy a safe or unsafe car is taken away - all cars are made equally safe. Because of this, car-buyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to choose their car for other reasons. Soon, safety in a car becomes a moot point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other incentives. Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive to drive safely - legislation has made cars, in consumers' minds, indestructible. If cars are indestructible, so then are the people in them.5. a. My demand curve shows that I would purchase 1 gallon of soda at a price just under $10. So when I purchase 5 gallons at $5 a gallon, I am better of by $12.50.b. I can purchase 3 more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at $3 a gallon than when it's priced at $5. Therefore, I'm better off by $2.50 - a gain of 3 gallons times a decrease of $2 divided by 2. c. If Diet Coke was free, I'd consume up to 10 gallons of it before it wouldn't be worth it for me to consume anymore. My consumer surplus is $50.6. a. A will sell chairs to B. A can make 5 chairs in the time it takes him to build 1 table, while B can only build 3 in the time it takes him to build a table. (A's chair-to-table time ratio is greater than B's - 1/2 to 1/3.)b. A will buy tables from C. C can make a table in only twice the amount of time it takes him to build a chair, while A takes five times as long to build a table than a chair. (A's table-to-chair time ratio is greater than C's - 5 to 2.)c. B will do neither. Since B can make chairs faster (rate of 1/3 for B to 1/2 for C), B won't buy chairs from C. And because C can make tables faster (rate of 2 for C to 3 for B), B can't sell tables to C.7. a. The equilibrium price is $3.96.   -10 + 50P = 2000 - 3P 53P = 210 P = 210/53 $3.96The quantity is 1888 textbooks. -10 + (50)(3.96) = 1888 2000 - (3)(3.96) = 1888 1888b. The sticker price becomes $6.79. -10 + 50(P-3) = 2000 - 3P -10 + 50P -150 = 2000 - 3P 360 = 53P P = 360/53 $6.79The market quantity stays at 1888 textbooks.c. The sticker price becomes $3.79. -10 + 50P = 2000 - 3(P+3) -10 + 50P = 2000 - 3P - 9 201 = 53P $3.79Market quantity decreases marginally to 179 textbooks. d. If the seller pays $3 per book in taxes, the seller charges $6.79 and receives $3.79 per book. If the buyer pays $3 per book in sales tax, the buyer pays $3.79 per book. The costs are equal despite which party is paying the tax.e. The government collects $564 ($3 tax times 1888 books) in tax revenues for this set of terms.8. a. The equilibrium price is $42. -10 + 5P = 2000 5P = 210 P = 42The market quantity is 2000.b. The sticker price becomes $210 - t. -10 + 5(P-t) = 2000 -10 + 5P + 5t = 2000 P = 210 - tc. The government takes in a tax revenue of 2000t. There are deadweight costs associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand for insulin. Therefore, consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax.9. a. Affects supply; supply curve will increase; price and quantity exchanged will increaseb.

Several items are outdated or have gone through many different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to stay in the system. I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just tests that are no longer used. Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. Just checking.Thanks,Kate\n"

Her number is 703-853-30001.I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, she said. I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to \"no confirm,\" but until that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check that they've marked their deals \"NO\" under the Confirmation heading.

I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.&lt; 2.   I have plenty of talent and vision. I just don't give a fuck.&lt; 3.   How about \"never\"? Is \"never\" good enough for you?&lt; 4.   It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.&lt; 5.   I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in&lt;   public.&lt; 6.   Ahh, I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again.&lt; 7.   You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.&lt; 8.   Stop, I'm already visualising the duct tape over your   mouth.&lt; 9.   The fact that no one understands you doesn't mean you're an artist.&lt; 10.   Someday, we'll look back on this, laugh nervously and change the&lt;   subject.&lt; 111.   I will always cherish the initial misconceptions I had about you.&lt; 12.   I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to&lt;   pronounce.&lt; 13.   Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.&lt; 14.   I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.&lt; 15.   What am I? Flypaper for freaks!?&lt; 16.   I'm not being rude. You're just insignificant.&lt; 17.   Thank you. We're all refreshed and challenged by your unique point of&lt;   view.&lt; 18.   It's a thankless job, but I've got a lot of Karma to burn off.&lt; 19.   Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.&lt; 20.   No, my powers can only be used for good.&lt; 21.   I'm really easy to get along with once people learn to worship me.&lt; 222.   You sound reasonable...time to up my medication.&lt; 23.   I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.&lt; 24.   I'm out of my mind, but feel free to leave a message.&lt; 25.   I don't work here. I'm a consultant.&lt; 26.   Who me? I just wander from room to room.&lt; 27.   My toys! My toys! I can't do this job without my toys.   So just leave them alone before you make them want to   leave as well.&lt; Useful Expressions for those HIGH STRESS days&lt; 1.   Well, aren't we just a ray of fucking sunshine?&lt; 2.   Not the brightest crayon in the box now, are we?&lt; 3.   Do I look like a fucking people person?&lt; 4.   This isn't an office. It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.&lt; 5.   I pretend to work. They pretend to pay me.&lt; 6.   You!!! Off my planet!!!&lt; 7.   Practice random acts of intelligence &amp; senseless acts of&lt;   self-control.&lt; 8.   I like cats too. Let's exchange recipes.&lt; 9.   Did the aliens forget to remove your anal probe?&lt; 10.   And your crybaby whiny-assed opinion would be...?&lt; 111.   How many times do I have to flush before you go away?&lt; 12.   Aw, did I step on your poor little itty bitty ego?&lt; 13.   How do I set a laser printer to stun?&lt; 14.   I'm not tense, just terribly, terribly alert.&lt; 15.   When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you.&lt; 16.   Earth is full, please go home.&lt;&lt;&lt;\n"

        " Kate Symes/PDX/ECT on 02/28/20001 01:13 PM --- \tEnron Capital &amp; Trade Resources Corp. \tFrom:   Jeffrey Oh   02/28/20001 01:01 PM To: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Todd Perry/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Joke of the DayFor anyone who didn't see David Letterman the other night, this is a true story. A little long, but not dirty (for those who might be offended) and totally worth the read: On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of quarters at a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for dinner with her husband in the hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash the quarters in her room. \"I'll be right back and we'll go to eat,\"she told her husband and carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator. As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men already aboard. Both were black. One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob me. Her next thought as: Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice gentlemen. But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. She stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered and ashamed. She hoped they didn't read her mind but Gosh, they had to know what she was thinking!!! Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was all too obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't just stand there, so with a mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, and the another second, and then another. Her fear increased! The elevator didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought, I'm trapped and about to be robbed! Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. Then one of the men said, \"Hit the floor.\" Instinct told her to do what they told her. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and collapsed on the elevator floor. A shower of coins rained down on her. Take my money and spare me, she prayed. More seconds passed. She heard one of the men say politely, \"Ma'am, if you'll just tell us that floor you're going to, we'll push the button.\" The one who said it had a little trouble getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a belly laugh. The woman lifted her head and looked up at the two men. They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet. \"When I told my friend here to hit the floor,\" said the average sized one, \"I meant that he should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't mean for you to hit the floor, ma'am.\" He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious he was having a hard time not laughing. The woman thought: \"My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself\". She was humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving as though they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say. The three of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket. When the elevator arrived at her floor they then insisted on walking her to her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she might not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter as they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed herself off. She pulled herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her husband. The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses. Attached to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card said: \"Thanks for the best laugh we've had in years.\" It was signed; Eddie Murphy &amp; Michael Jordan \n"

The autoscheduled deals are:5333090 - 3/1/01-3/31/01535419 - 3/2/01535420 - 3/2/015666081 - 3/1/01-3/31/015550208 - 3/15/01The last deal I'm checking on is #5355568 - in your spreadsheet you said EES saw the on peak hours totalling 1070.75 MWH and believed the on peak hours should actually total 1016.75 MWH. Below are the volumes I see both in the EnPower deal and in the March Dailies spreadsheet. +___=   1016.75 Maybe we need to autoschedule this one as well? Please let me know how the CARP report looks now, and call me with questions. Hopefully this wraps it up for March!Thanks,Kate503-464-7486\n"

Hourly deals will not be confirmed.   So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are entering deals.   The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact name.   It stops the whole process.   We are not going to be able to put names in every time they do not.   If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,   put the correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for contacts.Thanks!\n"

      "body": "\nTo all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning:Qwest Communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit. We don't know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.Bell, Alexander Graham   b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh   d. Aug. 2, 19222, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Can.   Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor of   the telephone (1876). For two generations his family had been   recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction,   with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing through   nearly 2000 editions in English. Young Bell and his two brothers were   trained to continue the family profession. His early achievements on   behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his 30th   birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.   Alexander (\"Graham\" was not added until he was 111) was the second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds Bell. Apart from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High School (from which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family trained and self-taught. His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in Elgin, County Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution. In 1864 he became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted his first studies in sound. Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life---as a teacher-scientist. In 1868 he became his father's assistant in London and assumed full charge while the senior Bell lectured in America. The shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell. Concern for their only surviving son prompted the family's move to Canada in August 1870, where, after settling near Brantford, Ont., Bell's health rapidly improved. In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston, lecturing and demonstrating the system of his father's Visible Speech, published in 18666, as a means of teaching speech to the deaf. Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way. Young A. Graham Bell, as he now preferred to be known, showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf. His astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture. Even while vacationing at his parents' home Bell continued his experiments with sound. In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of the deaf, edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer, and continued to study and tutor; in 1873 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University. Never adept with his hands, Bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire Thomas Watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity. Their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results. The fathers of George Sanders and Mabel Hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits. Nevertheless, during normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands. It is scarcely surprising that Bell's health again suffered. On April 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while maintaining his daily professional schedule, Bell had to return to his parents' home in Canada to recuperate. In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the telephone. On March 7, 1876, the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent Number 174,465 covering \"The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds.\" Within a year followed the commercial application and, a few months later, the first of hundreds of legal suits. Ironically, the telephone---until then all too often regarded as a joke and its creator-prophet as, at best, an eccentric---was the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history. The two most celebrated of the early actions were the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement. The charges and accusations were especially painful to Bell's Scottish integrity, but the outcome of all the litigation, which persisted throughout the life of his patents, was that Bell's claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current. In 18777 Bell married Mabel Hubbard, 10 years his junior. The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone; indeed, in many ways it was a beginning. A resident of Washington, D.C., Bell continued his experiments in communication, which culminated in the invention of the photophone---transmission of sound on a beam of light; in medical research; and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. In 18880 France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize; and the 50,000 francs (roughly equivalent to U.S. $10,000) financed the Volta Laboratory, where, in association with Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin, Chichester A. Bell, Bell invented the Graphophone. Employing an engraving stylus, controllable speeds, and wax cylinders and disks, the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording. Bell's share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American Association to Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (since 1956 the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf ). May 8, 1893, was one of Bell's happiest days; his 13-year-old prodigy, Helen Keller, participated in the ground-breaking ceremonies for the new Volta Bureau building---today an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf. In 18885 Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. There, in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland, he established a summer home, Beinn Bhreagh, complete with research laboratories. In 1898 Bell succeeded his father-in-law as president of the National Geographic Society. Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures, he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few. Again he found the proper hands, Gilbert Grosvenor, his future son-in-law, who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world. As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century, he experimented with giant man-carrying kites. Characteristically, Bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories. Always an inspiration, Mabel Hubbard Bell, wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group, soon founded the Aerial Experiment Association, the first research organization established and endowed by a woman. Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor Bell. At Beinn Bhreagh, Bell entered new subjects of investigation, such as sonar detection, solar distillation, the tetrahedron as a structural unit, and hydrofoil craft, one of which weighed more than 10,000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per hour in 1919. Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf, Bell never lingered on one project. His research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements. The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings, often totally unrelated to the subject at hand---reminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate. It was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end. Many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition; indeed, some undoubtedly have yet to be developed. The range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, 4 for the photophone, 1 for the phonograph, 5 for aerial vehicles, 4 for hydroairplanes, and 2 for a selenium cell. Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his journal. During his last dictation he was reassured with \"Don't hurry,\" to which he replied, \"I have to.\"\n"

You should be able to see ver 3.0.0.36 in production and ver 3.0.0.38 in stage,   if not phone David Poston for support. Ver 3.0.0.38 is newer and includes insignifficant changes on the form for selection desks, which   Corry Bentley requested here. They don't allow us to promote now things like that to production the last five days and the first day of the month.   Now the report is able to show both the term and schedule (liquidation) data. The term data are the way the deal was entered with   Deal Entry, Deal Blotter or EOL bridge, signed and confirmed. The schedule data should be very much the same with all the changes   in Deal Scheduling. There is no difference between schedule and liquidation data, schedule data is a subset of liquidation one in time and   it is about 2-3 weeks. At the moment the schedule strips for WEST contain data from 3/222/20001 to 4/5/20001, and the liquidation   the same data from 4/2/19996.   Because we don't schedule normally desk-to-desk deals (I think we schedule between EAST and WEST only) we don't have schedule   (liquidation) data for desk-to-desk.

I was not included in the testing phase of the new version and apparently the report is still not doing what the \"fix\" was initiated for.   Originally, my discussions with Doung Luu was for the Obligation report to capture: 1. All deals with any changes made in Deal Scheduling and   2.   All Desk to Desk deals.   Number (2),   I believe was the difficult one.   When selecting the option on \"Show Deals\"   in order to capture schedule changes you must select \"Liquidate\".   This does work, but it does not give you the option to select \"Show Desk to Desk\", which like I said before, was the intent of the changes.   Please contact me for further discussion.   I apologize for not participating and wasting your time.

It is now possible to run the report showing term, scheduled, or liquidated deals. In the past I've always run the report showing term deals, then entered my desk-to-desk deals from those numbers. Now I believe the report is designed to pull data from our scheduling database, so I'm wondering what the difference is between the term deal report and the scheduled deal report. Each produce completely different numbers! Please let me know when you get a chance.Thanks,Kate SymesTrading Support503-464-7486\n"

It looks like, for our purposes, the most accurate way to run the report is showing only term deals. The \"Schedule\" and \"Liquidate\" versions of the report do not capture desk-to-desk deals, and therefore will not show our traders' positions in relation to each other, which I believe is what we're looking for. Am I right? Or totally crazy? Let me know what you think.Thanks,Kate---"

      "body": "\nHey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept \"sticking it out another month\" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we know, or would like to know.It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think you'll know if Denver is really \"your kind of town.\" In the meantime, just take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to explain: when you walk into Mimi &amp; Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a habitat, but you get the picture.Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces of...well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk - away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was soo sweet, soo smart, soo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as \"Brian's Trip to Portland.\" It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew it...constantly. Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile \"the rest of our lives\" are slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, \"Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans.\" Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.Love,Kate\n"

Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one...I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me blankly and said something like, \"Don't be so overly dramatic,\" and then rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with \"us.\" I just assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse about how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. NO WAY! So that was that...or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man himself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date and then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride and didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a lame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told him that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the other night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is where he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't remember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're home in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things Amber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap stories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if you see anything you want back, just let her know.

I'm tryingto get John to do it, too.   Maybe we should all take one together!   Anyway,the website is uosummer.uoregon.edu (no ww), but unfortunately none of theinfo is posted yet because they're all a bunch of lazy pot-smokingsuperfreaks over there in Eugene.   Usually you can choose from any generaled courses - I'm taking polisci because I need it for my major.   They'llhave journalism and stuff like that.   We could crash at John's house andparty till the wee hours with all the wee freshmen!I feel bad about Kitty, too.   Is she getting more nuts than ever?   I wouldlove to bring her out here if it wasn't for the obvious obstacles (she couldnever go outside, she would rip my face off on the ride over, etc.).   If sheis still doing bad next year when my lease runs out, we could considerbringing her out here.   I could move into a house.   Anyway, I'm sorry tohear about the whole thing.   I feel really guilty too.   Hopefully Mom isavailable for the five minutes a day that Kitty actually wants contact withhumans.Well, have fun getting your hair cut and tell Brett I said hi!   I got myhair cut here and the man confused me with Jennifer Aniston circa 19990.   Ilook like a freak, and my hair is oily, and I don't want to go on this date.Have a good night!Anna---Original Message---From: Kate.Symes@enron.com [mailto:Kate.Symes@enron.com]Sent: Wednesday, March 14, 20001 1:444 PMTo: annas@cobs.eduSubject: RE:Hey - what the heck is zero week?

How's it going?Are you feeling better?   Is the roommate situation improving?   Mine is SOnot.   And to add to the drama, lonesomeness has once again driven me intothe arms of a man with whom I undoubtedly have no future.   He launched asurprise attack on Valentine's Day - when my guard was obviously down.   Yes,it's still the colorblind starbucks guy.   We were just going to go out for Adrink, but 9 vanilla stoli and cokes later we were making out like teenagersin a prom limo.   Even his baby poop green blazer-style leather jacket hadstarted to look like an acceptable outerwear addition to his camel-coloredwide-whale corduroy and pumpkin orange sweater ensemble.   It was madness.So anyway, I shacked, and unfortunately now a precedent has been set, so nowI pretty much spend most of my day coming up with various believable reasonsfor not spending the night at his house.   It's been almost a week so Ithink he's starting to suspect something.   Little does he know that by thetime this whole debacle is over, he will wish he had never heard the name\"Anna Symes\".   He's great and fun and everything, and yet I feel thatfamiliar desire to kill this relationship - and not just kill it, but shootat it and kick it in the head even after it's dead.   Think I have issues?Other than that, not a lot happening over here.   I like my new job, althoughright now it's really dead and I find myself wondering what I'm supposed tobe doing a lot of the time.   I have been playing phone tag with Monica, butI think I might start stalking her a little more intensely as I am indesperate need of some friends.   Actually, starbucks guy and I had aninteresting conversation about this last night.   I have been feeling so downlately, and I finally realized that this move was a million times harderthan London or Argentina were because I am literally starting from scratchin the social department.   Michelle is scary and therefore does not count asa source of moral support or even pleasant conversation.   I'm trying to seethis as a positive thing, like a challenge to see if I can be happy withoutthe network of people I have always had around me.   I know it's not thePeace Corps or anything, but it's still kind of scary.   Anyway, that's mydeep thought for the week.   I'm sure soon enough I'll be crying yet onceagain about how I want to come home, but for now I'm great (I think!).By the way, have you heard Ben Lee (singer)?   He Claire Danes' boyfriend, soyou may have heard of him before.   Anyway, you have to check him out - he'sawesome!   The cd I like the best has the word hurricanes or volcanoes orsomething in the title (sorry, I can't remember exactly).   It's a goodfeel-good cd.   So let me know how it's going out there in P-town, and whenare you coming to visit?

Molly and I already want to boot Amberout, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics wheneverpossible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out,and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather isfoul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of coursethere's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've gotto admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore.I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVEour house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets toDenver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Eitherway, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs,friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work andhustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'llgive you a call from my sick bed, 'kay?Take care,Kate\n"

      "body": "\nI'm so stoked you're going to Buena Vista Social Club. I can't believe you are such a rotten \"bik\" that you didn't invite me. What's up with that?My advice on the Outward Bound thing is to hold off. Not for selfish, wine-swilling reasons, of course; but because I know how tiring it gets to be living out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time. I have to say that sticking around Portland for the last six months has given me a renewed sense of mental health. Granted, I'm not totally sane yet, but at least I can imagine what it would be like. If you came home and turned right around and went to Colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed. Think carefully about how much Outward Bound would pay you in comparison with how much money you actually need to get by. Then add $5000/month to that figure, and you'll be about right. It always sounds easier than the reality - I'm only speaking from Maui experience here. If you want to do a whirlwind Denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally broke time, then totally go for it. But if you feel like you're getting to the end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind of sounds like you are - then hang in P-town for awhile. Like I said, I'd feel SOO much better about taking off on my next adventure NOW than I would have even a couple months ago. And it's only been six months since I got back - that's not really too long to wait. In the meantime, you don't have to live with mom. The Malachowsky's room will be open, although for all the help I've given them I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want a Symes there anymore. Then there's always my future apartment. I'm thinkin' downtown for sure.Anyway, we'll talk more about it in Mexico. Don't stress - whatever you're meant to do, you'll end up doing whether you like it or not.Love,Kate\n"

Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me know.2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals:   1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected   2) 5244481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.000] - added   3) 5244482 - same terms - addedLet me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.Thanks,KateEvelyn Metoyer@ENRON02/15/20001 02:56 PMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: 2/15 Bloomberg CheckoutJeff Richter:deal 5238777Bloomberg shows term as 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18I am missing the following deals:1)   Enron sells to   Reliant Energy 25 mw of 2/17-2/18 off-peak NP-15 at $2952)   Enron buys from Duke 25 mw of March'01 NP-15 at $2653)   Enron buys from Duke 25 mw of March'01 NP-15 at $265\n"

So to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 5867775. Each day Heather will take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 5867775, and she'll average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 5867775 - doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's just split between two deals temporarily. Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should be apparent to everyone that 5867775 does not need to be confirmed at any point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value properly.Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you more than less!Thanks,Kate   \tFrom:   Sharen Cason   04/20/20001 06:31 AM To: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: 5867775Can you check and see why we are not confirming this deal with Deseret?

We had to ch them to match the broker confirms, because APS showed the deals as APS on there side.   They are trying to segregate companies little by little.   We have been told by Rhonda, our contract administrator that trading under both names are legally correct, both are under WSPP.   DeeDee from Pinnacle said all trades are with Pinnacle unless Bloomberg trade; then cp should be APS.   DeeDee said shortly all trades will be under Pinnacle, but did not give me a specific date.   Please let the traders know that all trades should be with Pinnacle West, and APS that are transacted with Bloomberg.

I'll let you know for sure as soon as I talk to the traders.Thanks,KateFrom: Kimberly Allen on 03/29/20001 03:52 PM CSTTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Automated Power ExchangeHey Kate! I received a phone call from a Jim Cross from Automated Power Exchange. Now that we are confirming daily's he mentioned that he did not want to receive dailys per the APX Master Agreement. He told me that all trades are anonimus under the APX agreement and we should not be confirming theses. Examples: #563948 and #5633381. Some of the trader doing these trades are Chris Mallory and Les Rawson. Could you ask them is we should continue to confirm these daily's or not?ThanksKimberlyEnron Power Marketing, Inc.Kimberly Indelicato Office:713-853-3031Trading Support Fax:713-646-24443kallen3@enron.com\n"

I've entered the following comment in the six deals still in the system with Constellation at the old index:Constellation and EPMI have agreed to leave deal at PX Index. Counterparties' positions tie out - index price should not be relevant; however, index offset will. Per Bob Badeer, 4/18/01. KSThis is exactly how Bob explained it to me, and he said it was exactly as Constellation understood it as well. So if this sounds good to you, I think we're set. If not, please let me know and we can make whatever changes are necessary.The deal numbers, for reference, are - 453152/453175/453294/462109/471888/4718889Thanks for your patience on this,KateMelissa Ann Murphy04/17/20001 111:02 AMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Constellation Cal Px trades   Hello, I guess if he wants to leave the deals as they are in the system then the accounting group will see zero for an index price and they will see the index off set price.   If he and Constellation both agree to do nothing to these trades (not to revise the confirms or change the index on the trades) then we can put notes in the trades explaining that.   I just want to make sure that Constellation agrees with however we handle this.Thanks for your help,Melissa   Kate Symes   04/17/20001 12:28 PMTo: Melissa Ann Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Constellation Cal Px trades   I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.   But I suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint.

Basically, Idaho got their scheduled cut by the Cal-ISO, which in turn means we have to cut our schedule flowing to Idaho. So Jeremy Morris, one of our California schedulers, cut the first Idaho deal he found and passed the remainder of the schedule to Real Time to fill, which they did in a separate deal. So EPMI and Idaho are in agreement that the schedule got cut, but that we kept them whole by selling the remainder to Idaho in the hour-ahead market. Now the question is, how do we confirm the deal? From your side, is it better if we leave the deal as-is, or restore it to the original 25 mw off peak and kill the real time deal (which wouldn't really be an accurate representation of what happened)? Just let me know, and we'll do what we can to help.Thanks,KateStephanie Piwetz   04/02/20001 12:000 PMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Deal 565759.01Kate, please check, deal 565759.01, I verballed the trade with APB on Friday 3/30/01Enron Sells Idaho4/2-4/2220.000   total mw s4000sp 15Looks like it has been changed, each hour a different mw.

We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, (January 12, 20001).Thanks, Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863...   \n"

An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.Participants attending this seminar will be able to:Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines that are characteristic of energy prices.Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and transportation.Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of price curves and their components.Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship between basis and transportation/transmission.Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using embedded options.Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum prices, etc.\n"

A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals. 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when \"Desk to Desk\" is selected. 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done cross portfolio.I don't think \"both sides\" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our sale when we query for our point.

Again, I'm more than happy to help get this forward obligation report up to speed and producing the kind of data we need - just let me know.Thanks,KateCara Semperger02/12/20001 03:48 PMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-Portfolio   I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the \"killed\" feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular) in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying to do that.As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff through a few different channels of TS.   Even as we speak, I am running one report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one locally.   I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served me well.I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.   I have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times.   How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not a physical deal?I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.   It's not the best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.c   Kate Symes   02/12/20001 03:35 PMTo: Cara Semperger/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Desk-to-Desk v. Cross-PortfolioI'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on for the past few weeks. Also, deal 4984888 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. Am I missing something?As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do their jobs - do you know anything about that?I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in any way.Thanks,Kate---"

These are the start of the EES differences for March.   Both of these have to do with the ST-Whourly desk where we are lower by $5.000 then what EES has.

      "body": "\nYes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions regarding that time frame.Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions.

I tried to close my account on Thursday in a last ditch effort to get at my money, and they politely told me I could close it on the same day I could get money out of the ATM, which will be on Wednesday. Until then my hands are tied. I'm really sorry about this - I know Anna needs help, and believe me, this isn't very convenient for me either.

Then I talked to Matt Motley, who talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully solve this once and for all.You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties.

Right now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this \"Rocky Mountain High\" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this \"normal\" guy. You've got to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration with candles. Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need DETAILS, I need DIRT.

I will be writing this procedure.   There have been some confirms sent out recently that were inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.   More importantly, however, Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.   He also will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being created.   To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please immediately start doing the following:1.   On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.   By doing this, you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.   Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.   2.   I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.   When received, I will indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it and making sure it is accurate.   An accurate confirm generally means the deal was entered correctly into EnPower.3.   For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as soon as possible.ThanksChris\n"

I'm not sure how this works in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana reach an agreement.

Tracy is in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a deal is \"pending credit approval\" it's a little vague as to when the decision will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's case, I think sometimes deals get lost in the shuffle.

Unless I'm really invited to opening day?Kate\"Bill Symes\" &lt;wjsymes@home.com&lt; on 02/19/20001 111:40:57 AMTo: \"Bogden, Barbara\" &lt;bbogden@ix.netcom.com&lt;, \"Conerly, Bill\" &lt;Bill@ConerlyConsulting.com&lt;, \"Ewers, Sue\" &lt;EWERSSF@aol.com&lt;, \"Dal Molin, Tony\" &lt;tonydalmolin@home.com&lt;, \"Feldman, Christin\" &lt;feldmacc@excite.com&lt;, \"Hodson, Marilyn\" &lt;mhhodson@hotmail.com&lt;, \"Jones, Jenni\" &lt;JRoseJones3086662@AOL.com&lt;, \"Norris, Tony\" &lt;tasar541@msn.com&lt;, \"O'Brien, Jeff &amp; Liz\" &lt;oretasar@europa.com&lt;, \"Peet, Jennifer\" &lt;peet@bmsc-law.com&lt;, \"Poe, Amy TQO\" &lt;apoe@tqs.com&lt;, \"Salas, Steve\" &lt;smsalas@concentric.net&lt;, \"Symes, Kate\" &lt;kate.symes@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: Proposed date change for WSC Opening DayAfter some discussion about WSC Opening Day date,   Marilyn and I would like to propose moving it from Apr. 1 to Apr. 222. Our   reasoning is as follows:?1. Apr. 1 is last day of spring break which will be   a conflict for many WSC families. It's also just a week after the board chili   feed on Mar. 25.?2. Apr. 222 is the last Sunday of series sailing   before we go to evenings. It's the week after Easter, chances for good weather   are marginally better, and there are no conflicts that we are aware   of.?If you have any suggestions pro or con, please let   me know by Wednesday (we need to publish date in Mar. Telltales). If not, we'll   go with Apr. 222. Thanks,?Bill\n"

      "body": "\nSo didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the \"library\" on Thursday night and came home...four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the $5000 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for Food &amp; Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $1000 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.Kate503-2888-6546\n"

When I pull up my account information from the \"Savings Plan\" website, it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is not the retirement plan, what is?I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I thought they were automatically given to me.Thanks,KateAmy FitzPatrick01/16/20001 09:43 AMTo: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Re: Savings Plan v. 401K   Kate - 401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.   You are automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to participate for the year 2000.   Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these funds).   This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you leave. Does this help?Amy   Kate Symes   01/16/20001 09:34 AMTo: Amy FitzPatrick/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Savings Plan v. 401KI'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in advance for your time.Kate\n"

But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just bathed in a life-sized ashtray.

I wanted to write and see if youreally got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!   Itotally want you to come down!!!   I'd be so excited.   If you don't, though,I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill inSunRiver and snowboard a little!   Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/me at my parents house?   Ash is going up for sure.   If you're coming downhere, that's GREAT!   I'd be SOO excited.I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.   I have carpal tunnell, too.Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night outand he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over myentire shelf, tv, etc.   Then he started babbling about nothing, passedstraight out and started totally snoring.   So I didn't get back to sleepuntil like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.   I was livid this morning.   I'msuch a bitch, but I need my sleep!   Dammit.Anyway, write soon!

I can send you lists of all the people who work in each of these groups, but not all of them use Enron Online. To make this information as efficient as possible, I want to be sure of what you're looking for before I send you a huge list of names and make it more confusing than it needs to be. The other thing I just thought of is that I run an EOL deal count report every night which includes the West Desk's EOL and brokered deal counts for the day, month-to-date, and sometimes year-to-date. So I may already have this information or may be able to get it very easily. For now, I'll send you the list of our traders who use EOL. And please let me know what else I can do to assist.West Power TradersTim BeldenMatt MotleyMike SwerzbinMike DriscollBob BadeerSean CrandallDiana ScholtesTom AlonsoMark FischerJeff RichterChris MalloryJeremy MorrisPhil PlatterAgain, these are the traders in this office who currently use Enron Online.

I just had the most hectic week of my life!   I had such a greattime with Dad and Laura - is it just me or does he get cooler every time yousee him?   He took me, Nathan, Michelle and Monica out to this awesomerestaurant and totally paid for everyone.   I was so touched, especiallysince I think they're kind of trying to watch the funds.   My car is great!It's so little and perfect.   Then as soon as they left I went on my OutwardBound weekend, which was incredible.   We went snowshoeing, did a ropescourse, and learned how to use a map and compass (the last thing was SO fun- I want to buy a compass and carry it around with me everyday).   Anyway,I'll have to tell you more about it on the phone since it was kind ofcomplicated, but super fun.   I had SUCH a great time, and I'm even moreconvinced that this is the right job for me right now.   Nathan is still good- I'm installing a toothbrush at his apartment, which I think is a goodsign.   He's great.So what's going on in your life?   Call me tonight if you get a chance!Love, yo sista\n"

Things are still goingwith the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.   It was only amatter of time, you know.   Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying atworst.   Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers andtalks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi cab,and while eating dinner with his friends.   I just can't stand those things.It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by yourselfor in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in thecheckout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, Ijust think it's so rude.   But I'm going to try to get over it, becauseotherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earthwho has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.

      "body": "\nwhadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is soo in the air lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs (it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over it had his name on it and the word \"owner\" underneath. do you think that means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab where they give all the employees stock options and call them \"employee owners\"? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of unmolded flesh for any other reason...why would i, the proprietor of a running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your evening such as the one i just sent you.kateAnna Symes &lt;annas@cobs.edu&lt; on 03/15/20001 09:47:21 AMTo: \"Kate Symes (E-mail)\" &lt;Kate.Symes@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: Okay so my date was SO amazing!

He was just interested enough but kind of aloofwhich is the only thing that ever keeps me interested.   Kate, this is soweird.   Oh and he mentioned having a family twice, like as in working at arestaurant isn't good for having a family.   HOW CUTE IS THAT?   I am in love.Just thought I'd let you know . . .love, anna\n"

      "body": "\nDearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going really well though (Rocky Mountain \"highs\") and that you've made it through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain \"lows\"). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do not enjoy such things as \"Spring Break Mania\" anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in \"Dude, where's my car?\", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington and ends in...are you sitting down?...Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 1000 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!Love,KateAnna Symes &lt;annas@cobs.edu&lt; on 03/13/20001 02:555:09 PMTo: \"Kate Symes (E-mail)\" &lt;Kate.Symes@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: Hey Lady!What do you think you're doing?

I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.   Andnow I have a date, so I'm excited.   I'm still in contact with Mr.Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.   Infact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!   Anyway, that's crazy newsabout Mom's house!

I always knew thePacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with thatol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and Iknew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed orI'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realizedthere would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details ofwhat's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and moreimportant nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues -mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the \"library\" on Thursday nightand came home...four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-outsession on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known,including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that MarkyMcCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other thanDenver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous atthe beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that sheDIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarmingparty this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WASLEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told ourlandlords or paid the $5000 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHEWAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but nonemore than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let'sjust say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thoughtabout her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychoticallyself-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back thatshe didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmm. Not only did shenot want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Mollyand I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent andwidespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothingI'd rather be doing.Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that justbecause we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've neverbeen good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarmingparty. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant theywere all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there wereabout four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, nolove connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my newM.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives inSeattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writingan article for Food &amp; Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentiallyin the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up toSeattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $1000 bottles of wine atsome Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should Iwear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like theend of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the otherhand will be there five times before that because some psycho over therekeeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do therumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting aroommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.Kate503-2888-6546\n"

      "body": "\nBend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, \"Small Time Crooks,\" last night. I'd give it an unenthusiastic \"mediocre.\" Rent it if you've exhausted all other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out \"Traffic\" - I've heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's \"Cinema Paradiso\" for the sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor will be money, and beer. \"Traffic\" will cost twice as much as \"Cinema,\" but the theater showing \"Cinema\" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end up spending twice as much as I would at \"Traffic.\" Do you see the moral dilemma here? I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.Kate\"jordan mackay\" &lt;jordanmackay@hotmail.com&lt; on 02/20/20001 10:40:01 AMTo: Kate.Symes@enron.comcc:   Subject: Re:I can't believe that bitch would just wander into the house full of ire and phasers set to kill. I hope you let her have it. Some friend! She was just trying to get your goat. Knows to how to press your buttons and will continue to until she grows up. If I were you I'd follow the Buddhist path---extend compassion to her, don't let your state of mind be controlled by what she does, bend like a reed in the wind, etc. Anyhoo . . .I started to get a little sick last night. Think I might have been running a fever, so I came home and went to bed early. But I don't always sleep so well. The bed I'm?using gives me the distinct impression that I'm sleeping on a grade, that I'm slipping into a pit or a valley. My dreams?are always about climbing out of things. And then Hector the dachshund sleeps on the bed with me and even though he's only about a foot and a half long, it always seems like he takes up all the room. Oh, I'm just complaining. Cross your fingers that I don't get sick.\"Croupier \" I've always wanted to see. Glad you give it the thumbs up. I think I'm going to head downstairs and watch a movie myself. Perhaps Woody Allen's \"Manhattan,\" an old fave I haven't seen in years.Talk to you soon. Oh yes, and about the weekend. Of course I give you the \"flaky\"?time allowance you need. I would demand the same for myself. If you decide to come down, you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday. You don't even have to tell us at all. You could just come and not see us and head back Sunday if you want. We are that tolerant of flakiness here. No, seriously, if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you. If not, another time will come.jordanGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:///explorer.msn.com\n"

      "body": "\nThanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree. It's always nice to arrive at work Monday (or in this case Tuesday) morning and receive something other than urgent, faceless messages demanding my immediate attention. I received those as well this morning, of course, but being who I am decided to respond urgently to the frivolous ones and frivolously to the urgent ones.Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity. After a quick survey of the very little mess left after you two left (THANK YOU!), Molly and I decided to bag any further cleaning and instead go for a drive through some of the nicer Portland neighborhoods, admiring gardens here and paint colors there. Everyone was out enjoying the crisp sunshine and inhaling our exhaust fumes. But watching from our comfortable car seats was about all we could muster after the weekend's debaucheries. Then we returned home for a movie marathon that did not, you correctly assumed, include the Philadelphia story. We did watch two fabulous films - \"The Virgin Suicides\" and \"Croupier,\" both of which I highly recommend. We built a gigantic bed out of couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out. Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon, and I was amazingly more angry than I had previously thought, mostly because she walked into the house smacking of defensiveness, ready to fight. So rather than disappoint her expectations, I gave her what she wanted, only with more volume. If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night, they can be sure somebody lives there now.I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr. Down Under Wine guy. In my slightly more sober state, I'm starting to feel like he may own a winery in Australia, not New Zealand. We'll find out for sure later today. And I'll let you know when I hear from him.Thanks again for making the trip DOWN to Portland - you guys were great company. I'd love to come to Seattle this weekend; however, I never make plans more than one day in advance. I've found myself to be much too flaky for that. Let me know if you need notice sooner than that. Take care,Kate\"jordan mackay\" &lt;jordanmackay@hotmail.com&lt; on 02/19/20001 111:39:16 AMTo: kate.symes@enron.comcc:   Subject: I know you won't get this until Tuesday, I just thought I'd write for the purposes of consolidation. It was great meeting you and thanks for your hospitality and easy-going ways. I wonder if you watched the Philadelphia story. Probably not, but it's not going anywhere. It's a bright sunny day here in Seattle and, over a couple?of cups of coffee, I wrote all morning. At some point I'm going to go outside and do something today. A walk around the lake perhaps or a hike through the woods. ?Anyway, I don't have a lot to say. Thanks in advance for your help in getting me in touch with the New Zealand dude and do think seriously about coming down for dinner next weekend.

I was going to go on a company ski trip this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and not eternal grayness. Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home.

But don't worry about getting upset - you have every right. I am really sorry that I haven't helped you with Anna's finances, but I've felt so overwhelmed just making it to and from work everyday that I haven't managed to fit in much more. Just when I think I might be getting on top of things, I do something like lose my glasses, which then takes priority over everything else I thought I would finally be able to do, as I cannot see a word I'm typing at the moment. IThe madness is neverending! I hope it's comforting to know that no one has it anymore together than you do.Kate\n"

Sorry it's taken me a while to respond but it's chaoshere as we prepare to head off for the next part of our trip today.   Glad tohear the glow of the screen still has you enthralled.   Keep hitting F9 andall will be well.   The bit when the screen flashes like a disco ball meansyour pay is being cut.   I hope all those hideous applications I built thatyou were using haven't blown sky high.   But you know I did put little bugsin all of those things so that they would stop working about 4 months afterI left.   Sorry!   I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/ifI come back.Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.   But what you should really do iscome out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.   We're planning adebauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.   Shouldbe fun.   Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.   Bythe way, have you seen the movie Office Space?   I'd recommend it.Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.   He doesthis routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but hiseyes are actually closed.   Whenever you see that, just throw something athim.   Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.Hope all is well in sunny Portland.   Keep me posted on any unseemly officegossip.Talk to you soon.Winston&lt;From: Kate.Symes@enron.com&lt;To: wgoodbody@hotmail.com&lt;Subject: bananas and other things you can call me with&lt;Date: Thu, 222 Mar 20001 12:08:06 -08000&lt;&lt;Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes&lt;the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot&lt;that you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted&lt;sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I&lt;made up, but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.)&lt;All's well here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping&lt;expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all&lt;since you left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed&lt;positions, some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just&lt;the nature of this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable&lt;list is the status of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I&lt;still stare at the computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the&lt;dark window-less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly&lt;questions like, \"What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen&lt;starts flashing at me like a disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking&lt;noise and finally goes black?\" They are incredibly helpful. I am still&lt;pretty much clueless about most things, although I've learned to talk about&lt;them with a semblance of authority, as in, \"No, you twit, the 25 megawatt&lt;off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of&lt;the illiquidity of SP's market right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge&lt;their position in California at a time like this?\" It all sounds very&lt;exotic and important to me, which is why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely&lt;jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors. I suspect my&lt;forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle&lt;of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown. I&lt;haven't decided between a road trip through the western United States or&lt;just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, and way beyond my budget,&lt;therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to say practically nothing&lt;for long enough now. I do hope you're having an amazing time, rambling on&lt;toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac&lt;once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as&lt;\"my good friend Winston who's skiing across the state of Wyoming, which was&lt;my idea.\" I'd love to hear about your trip direct from the source, although&lt;I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and killing wild animals for&lt;sustenance and whatnot. But please do write back...if you can still move&lt;your fingers.&lt;&lt;Sincerely,&lt;Kate&lt;(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to&lt;look constantly busy)&lt;___Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:///explorer.msn.com\n"

I hope this helps.Thanks,Kate   \tFrom:   Sharen Cason   01/24/20001 01:000 PM To: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: more on #50009666This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending status.   This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.   I have put a note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised confirmation.Let me know if you need anything else.Thanks for the phone list.   Kimberly Hundl is soo jealous!\n"

There are A LOT of deals that need to be changed to \"no confirm.\"   I'd like to fax a list of them to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to \"not to be confirmed\" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to enter them correctly.   Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to get these deals to automatically be \"no confirm\" when the traders enter them.   You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the logic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.

Here's what I've done:On the first deal, #481619, I'd feel more comfortable if Mike Swerzbin, the trader who did the deal, gave his okay to change the price. I've left a message with him to verify the price, and at the very latest I'll see him tomorrow morning.Deal #4804333 cannot be killed because it contains liquidated strips; however, it looks like Phil Platter, the Short Term California scheduler, has alreday zeroed out the deal. Will this work? Or is there another method by which I can go about killing a deal? (Sorry to ask so many questions, but 90% of our office is already gone for the holidays and quite difficult to get ahold of.)I've changed #481620. I think the trader just overcompensated for the change back from Daylight Savings Time. I'll remind these guys to always enter PPT for the time zone, to be on the safe side.I hope this solves at least some of the problems for now. I'll let you know as soon as I talk to Swerzbin tomorrow.

We have tried to get them straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.   Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.Deal #481619 should be $145.000 even.   The trader says the deal was done direct and they are not paying the 5 cent chargeDeal # 4804333 should be killed.Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.   This is another one where the hours have been duplicated.   The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for the same hours.   This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount that flows that day which is 4000.Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas, ya' hear!\n"

It was very interesting, although it did lose me for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send another book along with it called \"Liar's Poker.\" I just heard about it and it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get \"Heartbreaking Work...\" She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come to her senses and quit being evil.Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one that comes after \"One Meellion Dollars...\") But study up and make us all proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study...or pay the price later.KateP.S. What the heck is your address anyway?\n"

      "body": "\nJudy -I just heard from Kim Hundl in Confirms that you had a discrepancy regarding a Short Term West Hourly deal entered for 4/4/01. Deal 570892 was originally entered as a buy of 5 MW for hour ending 111. Then the trader extended the deal, which is something Real Time traders do often, but when they do they rarely modify the deal in EnPower Deal Entry. They simply make the change in Scheduling. Because of that, unfortunately, you can only see the true total volume of the deal in our scheduling system.At any rate, I've corrected the Real Time sheet for 4/4 to show the correct volumes for the correct hours; and I'm terribly sorry for the confusion. Please feel free to call me or e-mail any questions you have regarding EPMI's coverage of EES's load. I'm noticing that nine times out of ten, the discrepancies originate when Real Time is hurriedly sending spreadsheets to you guys and not making sure that they match the deals we have in EnPower. Also, I was wondering if you could tell me what database or report you're looking at to tie out our deals with your records. I think if I knew more about your perspective, I'd be able to help more efficiently.Attached is the revised Real Time spreadsheet for 4/4. And again, please call with questions.Thanks,Kate\n"

Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through \"alternative\" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning. As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in bed. Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by the time he calls.Kate\n"

I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, but that's what makes everyday interesting.Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in (or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? Or ugly?Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 222nd, and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.Kate\n"

I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, \"What does it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?\" They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of authority, as in, \"No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at a time like this?\" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and constantly refer to you as \"my good friend Winston who's skiing across the state of Wyoming, which was my idea.\" I'd love to hear about your trip direct from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write back...if you can still move your fingers.Sincerely,Kate(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look constantly busy)\n"

The social schedule just never lets up. I don't know how feasible it would be for me to spend two months resisting the temptations of hand-holding boys and shadowy bars. But I will think seriously about the idea. Have a safe trip back home. Oh, and my Christmas plans still stand - gone from Dec. 222 to Jan. 2. Maybe it's you who needs a schedule rearrangement.Kate\n"

We go into each trade and change them to not to be confirmed.   The other hourly deals do not appear on these reports.   I think perhaps his defaults are not set correctly.   Can you check with him on this. I don't know why his are appearing on the reports and not other hourly deals.Thanks!   \n"
