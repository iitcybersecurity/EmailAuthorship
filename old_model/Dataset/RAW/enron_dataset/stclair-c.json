Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.3. Madison Gas &amp; Electric - will not agree to the \"or otherwise\" language in the setoff language.   Again, this is a credit issue.4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting a master in place with them.   Sara expects this to happen in the next few days.5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -   same as Cargill.   I am working on this one and their attorney owes me a response.   This one may take a few weeks.6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening letter.   It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial derivatives with them recently.7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to tell me specifically what they object to.   I will continue to follow up with their attorney.8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.   I will follow up with their attorney.10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.   Credit should be alerted.111. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.13. Public Service Gas &amp; Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an ISDA with them.   If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA negotiations.   I can prepare a mark-up.\n"

With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are waiting to hear back from Derek before we send them the letter.3. We need to receive from Mary a list of any additional new Omnibus Counterparties, if any, that have done trades with us since the date of the list that she gave us last week so that we can include them in the mail-out.   It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to those counterparties.   Hopefully, that group will be small.4. The plan is to roll out the new Annex A's to everyone beginning on May 1.

Due to the Moratorium that was in place here at Azurix, unfortunately, I could not speak to anyone at Enron in reference to possible employment opportunities.   The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your area or of possible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is detail oriented and possess strong analytical,   communication and interpersonal skills and proficient when it comes to ethical and professional responsibilities within the corporate arena.   Thank you for reviewing my resume and I hope to be speaking to each of you in the future.   Many thanks, Barb\n"

I am assuming that any vacation time that I still have left I can use up at 1000% pay.2. My understanding is that in order to go beyond the 6 week period I would need a letter from my doctor indicating the medical condition that exists and justifying sick leave pay at 90%3. If I want to take after the 6 week period an unpaid leave of absence, whose approval do I need?   Does unpaid leave affect any of my current benefits (i.e., options that are due to vest, medical, parking etc.)   If I am on unpaid leave and Enron offers a stock option program at year end, am I still eligible?I will contact Carmen about the forms that I need to fill out.

Are you ready?   Well, we are, and we're excited about it!!!   Here are some details that will hopefully answer any questions you might have about your child's experience in Enron's Kidventure summer camp.Camp officially begins each morning between 7:30 a.m. and 8 a.m.   You must bring your child to the Energizer private dining room by 8 a.m. (at the latest) each morning.   You do not need visitor badges for your children.   Enron security is fully aware that you will be bringing your children in each morning.   We will have five dedicated Enron security guards helping us with the camp each day to ensure your child's safety while in the building.   When going from the Energizer to the bus, your children will ride a dedicated elevator escorted by an Enron security guard.   Kidventure camp counselors will be active with your children as soon as you drop them off in the morning until the bus leaves at 8:15 a.m.   Your children will return to Enron at 4 p.m. each afternoon, and will continue their Enron-site activities until you pick them up between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.   All children MUST be picked up by 5 p.m.   A fee of $1 per minute after 5 p.m will be charged.At the beginning of each week of camp, you will pay the remainder of your balance to Kidventure Camps.   Your children will also receive their official camp t-shirt on the first day of camp.   You may purchase additional t-shirts for $10.000 each.   Each child will also make a name tag on their first day which they will use for their camp term.   Also, if you have not sent in your liability release forms, I must have them by tomorrow. Thanks!Hopefully I have answered all of your questions, if not, please call me at x37514 or e-mail me.Thank you and have a great summer! Michelle\n"

There are leagues at our club almost every morning and with Bill at home, it has given me the opportunity to get out of the house and play with the \"girls\" which is alot of fun for me and is helping me get back into shape.   I hate to admit it, but between playing tennis and doing some volunteer stuff at Arthur's school, I could actually get used to this sat at home stuff although I still really miss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in a few months.Charles is doing great.   Wait until you see how much he has grown.   I can't wait for my parents visit.   I just wish that they would stay longer!   Alos, don't be bashful about stopping by here when you are in the neighborhood.   The only bad times are after 7 at night.   Charles gets pretty cranky around that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleep more during the day.   Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during the day but I need to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.Before I forget, do you remember packing my gym bag, and if so, is that something that you can retrieve easily and bring with you next Sunday?   Some of my tennis shorts are in there and if there is a way for you to find it, taht would be great.Well I've got to go.

Alos, there may be some defined terms that are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined (i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)   Finally, should we upper case \"affiliates\" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or some other def?Carol\n"

Have you had a chance to think about what I e-mailed to you?2. DB, pursuant to our request, is considering refining the \"materially weaker\" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger to specify a ratings test.3. Insertion of our Rider 7 into the ISDA Schedule regarding confirmation procedures.4. DB reviewing LC language and our comments to the Enron Guaranty.   I guess we still need to discuss the :defenses\" language because as I indicated to you, I'm not sure that your compromise works for us.I look forward to hearing from you and sorry for the delay.Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

In Part 1, Section (e) of the ISDA Schedule, right after the definition of PSE&amp;G Reorganization Transaction you need to delete \"S&amp;P\".   I also need to see what you are planning to put on Annex C.2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you added to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at $7,5000,000.   In addition, in the proviso after threshold, the term \"Specified Condition\" should be changed to \"Material Adverse Change\".   A Mac would be triggered if Credit Ratings were below BB-.4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of collateral are cash or LC's why is consent required to substitute?5. I would like to discuss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13, Section (h)(ii).6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(ii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?7. I need to discuss with you just a few issues on the LC provisions.   I will send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.Hopefully we can get this resolved next week.   Tuesday through Thursday of next week work best for me. I will fax to you a mark-up with my nits and comments on the lC language.Carol\n"

Looks like some type of price protection mechanism is contemplated in the Master Derivatives Agreement and I'm assuming it would go into this confirm2. In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments and supplementsHarrier/Talon Schedule1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 132. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc.3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not Enron Corp. 4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please add after the word \"parties\" the phrase \"in connection with the Transactions hereunder.\"5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the class of permitted discloses in clause (iv) too broad?Talon/Enron Schedule1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added?2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule?3. Same comments as aboveMaster Derivatives Agreement1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the $4000,000,000 limitation?   For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should be reversed.Talon Note1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule applies since the setoff rights only benefit Enron and its affiliates.   Also,   what does it mean to refer to the Enron Guaranty here?Enron Guaranty1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setoff only apply to the Guaranteed Agreements and unless I'm missing something, I think we can give on that point.That's all that I have.   Have you discussed with Ben the point that we talked about last week concerning the difference between the calculation of \"Net Talon Loss\" versus \"Loss\"?I'm available tomorrow to talk about these points.Carol\n"

He is in the process of compiling information for all counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.   I have asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.   I think that the main issues to cover on Friday involve:1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to whether NY or Texas law applies.2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.   For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree with the terms of such deals.   I'll have David D. send up a sample.3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.I'm available anytime to talk about the above.Carol\n"

We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default provision.   We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and second-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that.   2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for \"materially weaker\" as below investment grade.   Is that a problem for you?3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to Transactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).   Is that a problem for you?   We thought that your operational issue had to do more with netting across product lines.4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to resolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.   I am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules and will get back to you shortly on remaining comments.Carol\n"

They claim that this conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which allows for recovery of attorneys fees.2. They want to delete   subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process.Can we give on these points?   They owe us back payments on financial swaps that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what we owe them for the crude that we purchase.   It's a long story as to how we ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done, that would be great.Carol\n"

In some cases, an entire month of data (temperatures, rainfall, and/or snowfall) may be missing.   For our internal purposes, our research group uses analytical tools to determine a \"best guess\" at what the actual data was.   We replace the blanks in our files with our best guesses.   We usually highlight derived data in our files, but we cannot be sure that we have highlighted derived data in every case.A customer is requesting some historical data from us.   We would like to send this data to them, but I am concerned about the legal liability of misrepresenting our analysis as fact.

I'm not sure that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is to acquire from another third party the name \"weatherdesk.com\" , register it and use it with respect to the products that they offer.All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.   We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead us to the right people that could.   It seems odd that we would be wiling to transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering these other names.

I'm not sure that this will be acceptable to them given their future intentions which is to acquire from another third party the name \"weatherdesk.com\" , register it and use it with respect to the products that they offer.All of these discussions that we have had over the past week with respect to our domain name have lead Seth, Scott and I to question what Enron's intent is with respect to the name or any variations thereof given the fact that according to Scott we have submitted applications to register similar names.   We were hoping that you could help us answer this question or at least lead us to the right people that could.   It seems odd that we would be wiling to transfer this name and yet feel that it is important to pursue registering these other names.   I look forward to hearing from you.Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)\n"

Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.   Since we have no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations required under each transaction that we enter into with them.   Specifically, the CA does the following:- calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash Settlement Amount payable- gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates- determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurredAlso, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty   cap to $25,000,000 from $15,000,000.   Is that okay with you?   They had initially requested no cap.On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following credit issues:1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.   You were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.

Netting - they are saying that operationally they cannot net across product lines.   Are you okay with this?2. Calculation Agent - they want to be the Calculation Agent.   Since we have no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing all of the calculations required under each transaction that we enter into with them.   Specifically, the CA does the following:- calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash Settlement Amount payable- gives notice of Settlement and Payment Dates- determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occurredAlso, my notes indicate that we agreed to increase the Guaranty   cap to $25,000,000 from $15,000,000.   Is that okay with you?   They had initially requested no cap.On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the following credit issues:1. Specified Transaction - they want to include physical energy deals.   You were going to think about this and whether we needed a cap.   They wanted to amend the definition of Specified Indebtedness to deal with this, but I think you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified Transaction.2. Cross Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?3.

She is going to address this with MarkTaylor and call us back. I believe it is a matter of finding words tosatisfy both of us.Please note that our requests in section 2 (b) and (d) will not be included,as section 3&amp;copy; governs.Enron also advises in section 6(b) the assignment and consent will onlyapply to assignments made by TLM not Enron, and our remedy would be to stopusing the website until we were satisfied with their assignee.Carol and I also discussed the possibility of having a letter agreement withthe Amended ETA attached,(rather than an 'exceptions' letter), which wouldbe the governing doc once we 'click'.I believe we are very close to concluding this.Best regardsAnneAnne LovePhone   403-237-1623FAX   403-231-2871Talisman Energy Inc.34000 888 3rd St. S.W.Calgary AlbertaT2P 5C5\n"

The trades will be performed based on indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of including Mexico into the EOL system.Thanks and regards. ---",

Jerome (Jerry) L. Francis, Esq., Sr. Real Estate Specialist   -   (713) 241-1823 [PLEASE NOTE, I TRIED TO CONTACT JERRY THIS MORNING AND HE IS ON VACATION. HE WILL RETURN TO THE OFFICE ON THURSDAY, MAY 4, 2000]; and2.   Gary W. Dzierlenga, Esq., Real Estate Specialist   -   (713) 241-1813.In addition to the above, you may contact the references listed on the Enron Job Application that I completed.After your conversations with the above references, if you feel a need to speak to my current employer references, please advise.Again thank you for your continued interest in me. I look forward to hearing from you real soon. I look forward to becoming a part of the \"swaps and derivitives\" group at ENRON!Have a great day!Don\n"

We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.4. We prefer the Loss method.5. We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for defining the \"materially weaker\" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as the timing for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well as the Credit Support Annex.   We believe that 7 Business Days is too long for posting an LC.6. We would like to make the GP of Encore a \"Specified Entity\".   We need to discuss with you your request to modify the definition of \"Specified Transaction\" to include physical transactions.7. In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose a cure through the posting of collateral.8. We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).9. We need to discuss the arbitration language.10. We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions of Default Rate and Interest rate.111. Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the Commodity Definitions Supplement?12. In the \"Recording\" section we would like to add the phrase \"To the extent permitted by applicable law\" at the beginning of the last sentence.13. We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.14. We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to secure financial obligations. Looks like LC's would be the only form of acceptable collateral.15. We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as the rounding amounts.16. We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer.

I noticed in the physical master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although the language in the physical says \"the exposure\" and it is not clear whose exposure they are talking about.

The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:   (i) align the legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (ii) achieve greater efficiency and consistency across the organization. To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets. The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.   More comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke\n"

      "body": "\nRussell:Based on my review of the 6/23 draft of ISDA Schedule here are my credit questions:1. There is no Credit Support Provider for Equitable.   Should there be?2. What should the cross default thresholds be and who should they apply to?3. Are you satisfied with the Additional Termination Event?   I'm assuming that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense to take \"future\" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it asset sales made during the current year?   How will we know what assets sales are made?   Will the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report that we receive annually?   When will this calculation be done?   Are you satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?4. In Part 3(a), looks like we would only receive an annual reserve report.   Is that sufficient?   When should we get it?   Alos, whose financials do you want to receive?5. In Part 5&amp;copy; - Setoff, I'll just note that this only applies to amounts due and owing between the parties and does not include \"affiliates\".   6. In Part 5(f)- Assignment,   we need to decide what conditions precedent we want to apply to the limited partnership entity that they assign it to given the fact that once assigned, we will have no recourse to the partners, even the GP.   For example, should the LP have a minimum asset value at the time of the transfer?   It is not clear to me what assets this LP would own at the time of the transfer and I'm assuming that we would want it to meet some minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.   In addition, are you satisfied with the debt and asset sale limitations?   On asset sales, I think that they need an annual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000 limit currently works.   Alos, I think that all of these limitations in Section (f) should either be additional Events of Default or Additional termination Events.Please call when ready to discuss.Carol\n"

My doctor needs to wait until he gets the other doctor's report before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning when I see him.   All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about what might happen.   There's not much I can do and the only way that I will know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.   The baby is fine.   He's almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!   Needless to say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!   The one funny thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there so she used the word \"relations\".   Bill couldn't understand   what she was saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.   I also had a good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.   She looked me right in the eye and said \"no more running\" which is what I expected.   Again, you had to be there!Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take it one day at a time.Carol---"

At his last visit last week he was 111 1/2 pounds and 222 inches.   Needless to say he likes to eat.   He is gradually starting to sleep more at night but is still pretty unpredictable and I've just gotten used to not getting alot of sleep.   Having Bill home with me is a big help and it makes it alot easier for me since we can trade off.Physically, I am feeling almost 1000%.   I started running a few weeks ago just to keep my sanity and have started playing tennis again although it is going to take a long time for me to get back into playing shape.   Arthur is very much into tennis and I am enjoying getting to watch him play.   He played in his first tournament over the weekend and did very well.   Bill and I are hoping that he keeps it up.   He has been great with the baby as I expected.   He is a calming influence on him and really interacts well with him.   I feel very, very fortunate.How are you doing and how are the boys?   I miss work and the interaction with everyone, but at the same time I am enjoying my time at home.   I think that you know how I must feel and I'm glad that I still have some time to think about it.   I can't imagine having to go back after 6 weeks as I am just beginning to feel good physically.   Carol St. ClairArthur is back in school and is a big help at home.   I'm enjoying being home with him when he gets home from school and its nice to be able to visit him while he is in school.I hope that you are doing well and not killing yourself up there.   How are your parents doing?   Please give them my best.   I keep promising to come up for a visit and I will soon.   Tomorrow (Thursday) may be a possibility.   Hope to see you soon.

I keep trying to pick a good day to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.   By the way, you and anyone else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!!   I know that it is far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?   How are you doing?   I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.   Charles is doing great.   He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.   He is growing like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he has started to sleep some more at night.   We are slowly but surely getting into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.   It's hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!   Time flies when you are having fun.Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.   Say hi to Mike for me and if he ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

I'm officially brain dead today so I thought that I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.Things on the baby front are progressing well.   On our last ultrasound we got the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so I've got the green light basically to do whatever I want to do although I am still taking it easy and swimming alot.   The baby weighed about 4 pounds a few weeks ago and everything looked great so I was quite relieved.   Now I'm trying to spend what little free time I have getting ready.   the people here at work are having a baby shower a week from Friday so hopefully that will help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.   Work is going well although I am looking forward to winding down in a few weeks.   I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time off but we will see how that goes.   I really feel great except for being uncomfortable at night and not getting much sleep but i suppose that this is good practice for when the baby comes.Arthur is doing great.   We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger pet!   They're pretty cute, small, clean and so far easy to maintain.   He is still heavily into baseball and was just selected for the All-star team which we were absolutely thrilled about as was he!   He called dad practically every day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping that dad can fly down for the tournament this weekend.   Arthur would   be on cloud nine if he came.   We'll see.   Mom and dad offerred to keep Arthur for a week over the summer and we are looking into that.   I'm toying with the possibility of sending him when the baby is born, but   I'll just have to see how it works out.   I would really love for you and mom to come once the baby is born.   Do you have any thoughts on that?   You are obvious;y welcome at any time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in august.   Let me know what you think.How is Cindy doing?   Do you know what she needs for her new addition?   Do you want to get her a joint gift?   Let me know.   I'm happy to do either something on my own or jointly with you.   How's Cate?   Give her my best.What's new with you and your career situation?   I hope that you are enjoying what you are doing.   I certainly am and   I am still undecided about what I am going to do once that baby is born, although I would really like to take the rest of the year off.I've got to run to my \"baby class\" tonight.   Take care and I will try to catch up with you sometime.   I love you!Carol\n"

Before I forget, what is the name of the breast pump that you are using?   Looks like the one that I have is not that great.   How many ounces should I expect to be able to pump?   I'm trying to judge whether I should keep this pump.   Anyway, back to Charles Eugene, he is pretty much of a night owl so i try to sleep when he does when I can.   We are ion a feeding frenzy every 21/2 to 3 hours and I'm hoping I can extend that at night soon.   Any suggestions?   What type of formula do you use?   Alos, do you have any secret methods for putting Jillian down to sleep?   Do you let her suck on a pacifier?   All Charles wants to do is suck on me.   Arthur was better at falling asleep on his own.How's Jillian doing ?   I can't wait to see a picture of her and I will be sending out pictures soon.   Arthur is adjusting well.   He is really into tennis now which I am thrilled about.   We were able to convince Bill's mother not to come this weekend because I am not quite up to a visit.   I think she took it well but you never can tell, but at this point I really don't care what she thinks because i am not ready for her to visit until I'm more mobile which hopefully I will be in another week or 2.Sue,How are you and Cate doing?   Can you talk to mom about scheduling a   visit so that we can schedule a christening date?   Bill's older sister's husband Bill is the godfather.   Mom mentioned late August but I would like to pin something down soon so that we can make the necessary arrangements.Well, I've got to go as I hear Charles waking up.

With respect to the Guaranty amendment that we had requested, it is just meant to clarify in the termination section that if the Guaranty is terminated then the Guarantor is still responsible for all of the Counterparty's obligations with respect to any transactions that were entered into prior to the termination date, even if such obligations are incurred after the termination date.   I do not feel that the termination language, as currently written in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys clearly reflects this concept as the language as currently written states that the Guaranty \"is revocable only with respect to liabilities occurring on or after the termination date.\"   I look forward to hearing from you.Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

In such asituation, the Tax would not be an IndemnifiableTax and therefore would notbe grossed-up.   Further, although such a change would be a Tax Event andtherefore the Payee could terminate the Agreement upon learning of the Tax,the Payee, because of its inability to learn of the tax law change mightnot be able to terminate in a   timely manner and would be precluded fromchoosing not to enter into the Transaction. The worse-case scenario wouldbe a Transaction entered into shortly prior to the Change in Tax Law, inwhich case the Tax would not be grossed-up because it is not anIndemnifiable Tax, and the Payee could not terminate the Transactionbecause a Tax Event is triggered off of a Change in Tax Law occurring on orafter the Transaction has been entered into.   We think this risk isreciprocal in cross-border transactions. The Indemnifiable Tax revisionsimply shifts this incremental risk from the Payee to Payor.   I can alsoprovide alternative language whereby we maintain the same gross-upprovisions as in the standard ISDA Master, but extend the \"notice\" periodto sixty days prior to the date a Transaction is entered into (rather thanon the date in which a Transaction is entered into), thus providing awindow for learning of legislation in other jurisdictions.On other open issues, I believe you are to check on (i) CEUM, (ii) theEvent of Default, (ii)   Payment Netting, (iv) Securities Act Reps (v)Transfer language, and (vi) Arbitration.

(except if the circumstances in the definition occur).   It thus results in the payer having to gross up for such taxes.Do you think that we can or should accept this?Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)\n"

Here is my understanding of the remaining open issues:1. Whther termination is automatic or elective on bankruptcy.   You are considering our request to make it elective.2. Loss vs. Market Quotation.   We are considering whther we can accept your proposed language.3. Time period for posting collateral.   You are considering how long you need.4. Cash collateral.   I am checking with our office in Canada about this.5. MAC clause - you are considering whther this should be an Additional Termination Event with the ability to cure by posting collateral or an event that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.6. Default rate definition -   Ed is considering what we can accept in lieu of the ISDA definition.7. No Fault Termination - we are considering whether we can accept this.8. Credit thresholds and Rounding amounts - you and Ed to discuss.9. Acceptable LC Issuers - Ed to consider whther limiting it to US and Schedule 1Canadian banks with a certain credit rating is sufficient with language that the parties can agree to add foreign banks.Let me know if I misstated and of the above issues.

In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae \"as it relates to the Assigned Interest\" has now been deleted.   Pursuant to my earlier comment on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens to Pelican .   Is that the way it is supposed to work?   If so, plaese explain why.3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the first sentence of such Section \"the amount determined...\" shouldn't it say \"the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the Transaction\".   Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Matters and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or Termination Event occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur.   What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?   Does each party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

I'm seeing in the credit system that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.   Secondly, is there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?   In pulling the mtm monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.   Kaiser is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how quickly this out-of-the-money position can move? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or Master ISDA)? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a Netting Agreement for UK and US financialCan you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.   Please let me know your thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points addressed.   In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton about the concept as well.Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in setting up a conference call to push this forward.Thanks,Tracy\n"

Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (\"Kaiser International\") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?   If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off of it for trading liquidity in the states.   Secondly, does the netting need to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as well?If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.   Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.   ENA is looking to enter into a power swap for June '01.   I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.   However, if we can't do a June swap, then we'll try for a July swap.Regards,Tracy\n"

We can discuss further what this means, but I really feel that it would not be good for me or my family for me to start off working full time.Next, I would like to talk with you about what my responsibilities would be in the swap group if I return and have a clearer understanding of the areas in which you would want me to work, particularly now that we have more people.   I know that alot of chnages have occurred in the last few months and I'm hoping that there are specific work areas that I could devote my attention to.Those are my thoughts for now.

We talked about the possibility of having a group offsite meeting in early January to talk about group goals, work assignments/areas of responsibility for each attorney etc.   What do you think about that idea?   As I mentioned to you at our lunch, I need some direction as to what my responsibilities will be when I return to the group and given the fact that we have acquired more people and more work areas, it seems like some planning and discussion as to who is responsible for what work is in order.

On the latter issue, I explained to her that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it made perfectly good sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's training especially since Tana was now out of the day to day stuff.   I am very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training process given her attitude toward the whole thing which I really feel is ridiculous.   The only possibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't tell her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.   I explained to her that both she and Tana had different roles to play with respect to Samantha's training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to work better is through \"communicating\" to each other.   I firmly believe taht there are 2 sides to this and taht all 3 of them are guilty of treating the other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.   Tana of course will not admit this.   I have no answers for this issue other than the fact that I am tired of hearing about why they can't get along.   I also told Tana taht it was my perception that Susan Bailey has been under alot of pressure given her increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her attitude which even I have noticed has been a little different lately.I'm letting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.Carol   \n"

Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review.   Please note the following as you review:1.   The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services --- all of our midmarket   forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&amp;D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.2.   I did not include a \"Setoff\" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers.   If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so.3.   The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form --- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).   Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a \"force majeure event\" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs).   Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does --- again, more in the interest of \"saving space\" than anything else...Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.   If you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.Thanks again for your help with this project,MarianneP.S.   Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response --- they will be taking this project during my \"hiatus\"   ---   I am moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16.

Attached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review.   Please note the following as you review:1.   The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services --- all of our midmarket   forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&amp;D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.2.   I did not include a \"Setoff\" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we will not, nor will an affiliate, have another agreement in place with these customers.   If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so.3.   The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form --- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).   Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a \"force majeure event\" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs).   Also we do not address calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does --- again, more in the interest of \"saving space\" than anything else...Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.   If you are comfortable, we will drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.Thanks again for your help with this project,MarianneP.S.   Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennifer Hillegonds on your response --- they will be taking this project during my \"hiatus\"   ---   I am moving to PA on Friday of this week, and will be out of pocket through approximately 7/16.   I will start up again in mid-July...\n"

Just a few additional thoughts:1. Since we will be redoing all of the existing confirms to refer to this Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts between the Confirms and the Agreement are resolved in favor of the Confirm.   I think that the language as written works.2. On the setoff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only pull in other agreements between our affiliates and inland so I don't see how this language would impact any agreements between ENA and guaranty Bank unless Inland is the Non-Defaulting party.3. With respect to Disruption Fallbacks, our view is that if the Confirm specifies a Fallback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use that price if available.   I think that the language works as drafted.4. On cash collateral, the Qualified institution concept only applies when the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the threshold.   Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the collateral and do whatever it wants to with it.   Your are correct that in practice this cash gets commingled with corporate funds and swept into the party's bank account but there is no requirement taht it work that way.We look forward to having a call with your group next week.   Please e-mail me with some days and times so that I can alert our people.   thanks.Carol St. ClairEB 38889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

We have tried to incorporate all of the changes and comments we have received in our last three offsite meetings.   We have left some questions and open issues in brackets.   I addition, we have highlighted some areas for extra attention, some of which are explained below:Section 1.2:   The term of the master is month to month; each transaction will have a specific term, as set forth in the applicable confirmationSection 1.3:   We need to make a final decision on whether all credit terms will be in the master or whether some will be in the confirmationSection 1.4:   We have made the usage bands monthly by account; this can easily be changed if there is business consensus to do so.Section 2.7:   Instead of utility non-performance (physical or financial) being an event of force majeure, we have added a new section addressing that.   It provides for a free termination by EES in such event; we need to consider whether there should be a payment.Section 3.1:   subsections (v), (vi) and (vii) need credit review as indicatedSection 3.3:   termination payments are now bilateral (defaulting party gets paid if non-defaulting party has a Gain).Sections 3.6 and 3.7:   Probably can be shortened while keeping the concepts; is the first sentence of Sec. 3.7 needed?Section 3.9:   Need input on highlighted language; need to decide whether we want a bilateral early termination payment here.Special Utility Charges definition: we pass through surcharges here.Assignment: do we want to give customer right to assign without consent in any circumstances (like to an affiliate)?Confirm: Transaction Term:   need to confirm that this is how we want start/end dates to be determined.\n"

This is the portion relating to Nohires. The memo I've been working on is a summary of Jim Derrick's 10/27/999 memo regarding required approvals plus other ENA policies and language re these provisions.   THis language is the same as the memo from Lance that you mentioned. Regarding approvals, since business persons (Detmering, Metts) must make them there is much feeling among attorneys I work most with that business persons should secure these approvals.Let me know if you have comments, questions or need anything else.K\n"

These change=\rs=20\rare intended to accomplish four key objectives:\r First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=\rl=20\rbusiness model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\r=20\rThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\raround a relatively small strategic asset position.\r Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\rrelationships.   Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=\r=20\rdirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=\r=20\rhas become increasingly difficult.\r Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\rg=20\rthe ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20\rhindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\rg=20\rasset positions.\r And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=\r=20\rredeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.\r ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\r Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=\r=20\rour global wholesale businesses.   The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\rbusinesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20\rcoordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\r=20\rhigher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20\ropportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=\rf=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=\rd=20\rmarkets.\r Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=\r=20\r(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\roperations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=\rnit=20\ras well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.   In addition, Enron=01,s me=\rrchant=20\rbusinesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=\r=20\rnew structure as described below.\r Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=\re=20\rthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.   Greg Whalley,=20\rcurrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=\r=20\rof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.\r Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\r=20\rinternational business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\rp=20\rpositions:\r Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=\r=20\rand CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=\ry=20\rfor managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=\rorth=20\rAmerica and Europe.   Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=\r=20\rwill be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.   Rebecca and Jim will=20\rreport to the EWS Office of the Chairman.\r Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\rhe=20\rMiddle East and Asia region.   Sanjay will be responsible for building our=\r=20\rbroadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=\r=20\rwill report to Sanjay.   In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =\rof=20\rthe Chairman.   In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=\r=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=\rness=20\rinto Enron Global Assets in the near future.\r=20\rDiomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\r=20\rEBS as Chief Commercial Officer.   Diomedes will be located in London and wi=\rll=20\rfocus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20\rattention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.   Diomedes will report to=\r=20\rthe EBS Office of the Chairman.\r Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=\rS=20\rto lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.   In or=\rder=20\rto ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20\rfacilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=\r=20\rat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\rh=20\rAmerica.   Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=\r=20\rthe Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.   Following the=20\rtransition, Jim will join EES.\r In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20\ractivities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=\r=20\rbusinesses and the commercial support functions:\r Enron Net Works\rLouise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\r and=20\rCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\r Enron Americas\rConcurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=\r=20\roperating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20\rmarketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=\rt=20\rinto a new entity, Enron Americas.   Enron Americas will have responsibility=\r=20\rfor all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20\rAmerica.   Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\rOperating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20\rAmericas.\r Enron Europe\rThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=\rralia=20\rand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\r=20\rSherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.\r Enron Global Markets\rEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=\r=20\rCEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20\rresponsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.   With the=20\rexception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20\rassociated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=\r=20\rEnron Global Assets.   Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=\r=20\rcommodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20\requities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.\r Enron Industrial Markets\rEnron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=\rahon,=20\rPresident &amp; CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.\r Commercial Support for EWS\rThe commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=\ry,=20\rthe individual business units.   We are creating no incremental overhead in=\r=20\rthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\r=20\refficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.\r To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=\r=20\rEWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.   These=\r=20\rnewly defined roles are as follows:\r Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=\re=20\rOperations across EWS.   These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=\r=20\rwith Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20\rPresident and Chief Accounting Officer.   This alignment creates a coordinat=\red=20\rservices organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20\rwholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=\r=20\rservices.   Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=\r=20\rcontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=\r=20\rfor specific commodities and/or geographic locations.\rLegal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\rRegulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =\ron a=20\rregional basis.   Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=\r=20\rthe Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=\r=20\rEuropean and Eastern Hemisphere operations.   Rick and Mark will also contin=\rue=20\rto support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=\r=20\rand will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=\ref=20\rof Staff.\rPublic Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=\ral=20\rbasis.   Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20\rEnron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.   Jackie Gentle will continue=\r=20\rin her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=\rr=20\rwill have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=\r=20\rwell as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=\r =20\rThese individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=\r=20\rto Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.\rBusiness Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=\rver=20\rEWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.\r Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20\rServices which summarizes the changes described here.   As this organization=\r=20\rcontinues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.\r ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION\rAND ENRON WIND\r   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=\rts=20\raround the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=\r=20\rEGEP and EWC.   As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=\rf=20\rBaxter=01,s direction.   Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=\rnron=20\rWind, will report to Cliff.\r CORPORATE STAFF\r   We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20\rGovernment Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.   In=\r=20\rthat regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=\r=20\rCommunity Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=\rd=20\rChief of Staff.\r COMMITTEE STRUCTURE\r   In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=\r=20\rgrowth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20\rbusiness unit leaders.   The primary role of this committee will continue to=\r=20\rbe the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=\rnd=20\rthe coordination of activities across those businesses.   We will also be=20\rdrawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20\rperformance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =\r=20\rThe Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.\r   We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=\rtee. =20\rThis group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20\rmanagement policy and corporate strategy.   The Enron Corporate Policy=20\rCommittee membership is also shown on the attached list.\r   We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =\rto=20\rour highest return opportunities.   Please join us in congratulating and=20\rsupporting all of these individuals in their new roles.\r \n"

For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&amp;P or A3 by Moody's.   Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?Carol\n"

You may recall that in Credit Event Upon Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BB- or better OR Baa3 or better.   They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to the \"transfer\" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.   Are you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?   Our typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee provides a satisfactory guaranty to us.Carol   \n"

Her main concern given the fact that we now have a Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a GTC.   Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel better.   Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me   and I will let you know if it is acceptable.Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a \"test\" run on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a GTC.   I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product description once they get their password.   I understand that you and Tana will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.Please call me if you have any questions.

They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.   I'm not sure I understand   why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of the language and wanted your thoughts on this.   Alos, does the second part of the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of Default trigger.   Should we specify a threshold?4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual ratings triggers.   For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger for that to go to zero is something else.5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I think is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $5000,000.Please call me when convenient to discuss further.Carol Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)\n"

This will obviously be a discussion point given the type of commodity that we anticipate. trading with them2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount just for them of $250,000.3. They want to reduce rounding to $25,000.4. They do not want the provisions of section 6&amp;copy; of the CSA to apply at any time.5. They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to terminate and have a payment   obligation owing to us before we could draw.6. They do not want any LC to be transferable.7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return collateral taht has been posted to us, which I guess means that if we didn't return collateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount.   Without this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,   terminate and then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them.   To the extent that we were holding cash colateral, they could offset that amount against amounts that they might owe us.   This is an interesting issue and one that I have not seen before.8. They want the Guaranty cap to be rased to $25,000,000.Where does this ISDA stand on the priority list?   Is this something I should try to push forward in the next week or 2 while I am hear or can it wait?Carol\n"

We don't have a problem with a 3-business day requirement for posting cash collateral nor a 3-business dayrequirement for \" transfer date\" interest posting. We have a question into our counsel (who has been out sick) on whether weneed some form of Board approval for posting collateral.Our main concern (and the reason we would like a 10- business day timeperiod) is if we choose to provide credit support with a LOC, we don't havethe staffing and bank pre-arrangements to be able to put an LOC in placewithin a shorter period. Since we don't currently exchange collateral,posting a LOC would not be something we do in the normal course of business.As such, if the need should arise, we would like to have sufficient time toallow staff to look at our alternatives and provide the form collateral thatbest suits the situation.&lt; ---Original Message---&lt; From: Carol.St.Clair@enron.com [SMTP:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com]&lt; Sent: Wednesday, May 16, 20001 8:47 AM&lt; To: GRichar@smud.org&lt; Cc: Tracy.Ngo@enron.com; Stewart.Rosman@enron.com&lt; Subject: Re: EEI Changes&lt;&lt;&lt; Gary:&lt; These changes look fine.   I have had further discussions with Tracy on&lt; this&lt; 10 day issue and we have a change that we would like to make. We would&lt; like&lt; to add language that would require SMUD within 3 Business Days of our&lt; collateral request to send us an Officer's Certificate certifying that&lt; Board Approval is required in order to post the collateral requested.   If&lt; no approval is required, we feel that the extension of time is not&lt; necessary.   Also, if you are posting cash,   should the extension apply?&lt; If&lt; so, why?&lt;&lt; Also, I still don't understand why the 10 day requirement should apply to&lt; the \"Transfer Date\" concept which only requires the non-posting party to&lt; pay the posting party interest each month on cash collateral that has been&lt; posted.

      "body": "\nKeith:Thanks for your prompt response.   I can respond to some of your comments.1. In point #1, I was referring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed Section 5(a)(vi) from cross default to cross acceleration.   From a credit standpoint, we prefer a cross default trigger.2. I will check with Ed on point #2.3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the difficulty in perfecting an interest in cash collateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian counsel as well as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this issue), we do not accept cash collateral from Canadian counterparties.   With respect to surety bonds, there is a statute in New York called the Appleton Law which prohibits a surety from issuing a bond to guaranty financial performance.   For this reason, we do not accept surety bonds as collateral.4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes.All of the other points need to be discussed.   Can we now schedule a call for later this week or next week to walk through the remaining issues?   Please let me know some times that work for you and Mike roach.   I am not in the office on Mondays.   I look forward to hearing from you.

We cannot agree to cross-acceleration.[KF: I assume you are referring to \"Default under Specified Transaction\".Encore's view (and the view of a majority of its counterparties) is thatwhere the same parties have both physical and financial transactionsoutstanding, a default under one category of transaction is sufficientlysignificant that it should trigger a default under the other. There may bereasons why Enron feels this is inappropriate, and we would appreciate yourcomments.]2.   There is a note that the cross default threshold needs to bediscussed.   Enron's $1000 million threshold is based on the threshold thatits banks accept in its credit agreements.[KF: In the transactions documented in November/December of last year, the$1000 million threshold was accepted as a materiality threshold in relationto Enron Corp., and a $50 million threshold was accepted for Epcor UtilitiesInc.   I'm not sure why the reduction to $25 million for Epcor was suggested.More importantly, I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have been discussingan alternative, which would be a percentage of net tangible assets, and thatMr. Sacks was going to give that some thought.3.   We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.[KF: Our concern is that creates a risk for the non-insolvent party inrelation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatictermination clauses in their agreements. The short-form agreements signed inlate 2000 appear to accept automatic termination.]4.   We prefer the Loss method.[KF: Are you opposed to the non-defaulting party having the choice betweenLoss and Market Quotation?}5.   We would like to discuss with you your credit rating test for definingthe \"materially weaker\" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as well as thetiming for posting collateral as it appears in this provisions as well asthe Credit Support Annex.   We believe that 7 Business Days is too long forposting an LC.[KF: I need to discuss the first point with Mike Roach. With respect to thesecond point, we are advised by Epcor's treasury group that the time frameis necessary, and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify asEligible Collateral; if the time frame is required to produce an LC, wewould envision putting up cash within, say, a two Business Day period andsubstituting an LC when it is issued.]6.   We would like to make the GP of Encore a \"Specified Entity\".   We needto discuss with you your request to modify the definition of \"SpecifiedTransaction\" to include physical transactions.[KF: I assume this is related to your first point.]7.   In the MAC Additional Termination Event, we would like to propose acure through the posting of collateral.[KF: Agreed; I assume the value would be an amount determined by the otherparty, acting reasonably?]8.   We would like to discuss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).[KF: If Alberta law is to apply, we thought Alberta courts should havejurisdiction. I understand that both parties have offices and conductbusiness in Alberta.]9.   We need to discuss the arbitration language.[KF: For background, this language was proposed by Enron and is consistentwith the approach taken in the prior agreements.]10.   We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions ofDefault Rate and Interest rate.[KF: Again, this was done to \"Canadianize\" the agreement. References to U.S.rates when the currency is Canadian dollars didn't seem appropriate.]111.   Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the CommodityDefinitions Supplement?[KF: I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule.]12.   In the \"Recording\" section we would like to add the phrase \"To theextent permitted by applicable law\" at the beginning of the last sentence.[KF: Agreed.]13.   We cannot agree to No Fault Termination.[KF: This is a significant issue. In the event of a fixed for floating priceswap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Pool price, myunderstanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with thefloating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers.Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that thecommercial basis for their agreement will be undermined and that No FaultTermination is the better approach.]14.   We cannot accept Surety Bonds as a form of collateral to securefinancial obligations.   Looks like LC's would be the only form ofacceptable collateral.[KF: Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond issue. He also advised thatEnron has concerns about cash qualifying as collateral because of concernsabout perfecting a security interest in cash. Can you outline the concerns?]15.   We need to discuss the credit threshold language as well as therounding amounts.[KF: I understand that is part of the discussion between Messrs. Sacks andRoach. I also understand Mr. Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerningwhat he perceives to be the \"political risk\" in the Alberta marketplace, andthat this needs to be completed before the specific credit issues areaddressed. Can you confirm?]16.   We need to discuss what constitutes an acceptable LC Issuer.[KF: I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point inpart involves understanding which banks are involved. If the Epcorinformation has not been provided, please let me know and I will arrange tohave it passed on.]I look forward to hearing from you.Carol St. ClairEB 38889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.comRegards,Keith FergusonFRASER MILNER CASGRAIN LLP&lt;http:///www.fmc-law.com/&lt;29000 Manulife Place10180 - 101 StreetEdmonton, AB   T5J 3V5(780) 970-5285 Direct Line(780) 423-7276 Faxkeith.ferguson@fmc-law.comThis message, and any documents attached thereto, is intended only for theaddressee and may contain privileged or confidential information.

In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words \"dueto\"need to be put after the word \"means\" in the first line.2.   In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae \"as itrelates tothe Assigned Interest\" has now been deleted.   Pursuant to my earliercomment onthis, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Paymentpiece ofthis, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happens toPelican.   Is that the way it is supposed to work?   If so, plaese explain why.3.   With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of sayingin thefirst sentence of such Section \"the amount determined...\" shouldn't itsay \"thefair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under theTransaction\".   Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to DisputedMatters andit is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default orTerminationEvent occurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occur.Whatis the priocedure for coming up with this amount?

In each case, if they deliver collateral, no Event of Default occurs.3. Collateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a MAC occurs and there is a failure to deliver collateral within 90 days or an Event of Default occurs.4. $1,000,000 rounding amountsWith respect to setoff rights, I spoke with David Mitchell about this and if it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same Kaiser entity but different Enron entities and the metals ISDA has appropriate setoff language, then we feel fairly comfortable that upon a Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setoff rights.What is the next step?Carol St. ClairEB 38889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\tRoderick Nelson/Enron@EUEnronXGate\t05/25/20001 09:15 AM \t\t\t To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT, Diana Higgins/Enron@EUEnronXGate\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: RE: KaiserHi Carol.

However, in the special case of legal bankruptcy, such netting (though contractually agreed by the parties) may be challenged.

I considered items # 2,3,4,6, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19 and 21 to be credit-related comments, some of which I need my credit person's input on.   As to the remaining points, here is my response:1. Let's discuss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agree with you on the concept.2. With respect to item #7,   your interpretation is correct.3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.   As a general rule, with respect to setoff rights, to the extent that ENA is the Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's affiliates have entered into other agreements with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those affiliate agreements can be setoff against amounts owed under the ISDA.   All the guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteed under the Guaranty takes into account the exercise of such setoff rights.4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.5. I agree with your point #13.6. With respect to point #14, collateral is limited to cash and LC's and the concept of a custodial account applies when someone other than the Secured Party is holding   the cash collateral.7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash collateral when an Event of Default occurs even if we have not yet terminated all transactions.   Once we have terminated and established a termination amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.8. The \"deemed occurrence\" language   is meant to cover termination events that occur automatically without either party electing to terminate, such as in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.   We could probably take it out since there is no automatic early termination on bankruptcy.I look forward to hearing from you.

I will also include a cover letter we would both sign that once we'click' the ETA is executed, but not the one on screen ,but the one attachedto the letter agreement.Thank you for your help, and trust this is the easiest way to close thisfile.Congratulations for the new baby,For now Anne---Original Message---From: Carol St Clair [mailto:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com]Sent: June 20, 2000 7:47 AMTo: Love, AnneSubject: UpdateAnn:Are you still working on sending us a new draft of the ETA amendment?

Do you think that it would be better just to change the&lt; effective date of the Master and the Transfer Agreement to the date of&lt; Utilicorp's execution of the Master?&lt;&lt;&lt; Carol St. Clair&lt; EB 3892&lt; 713-853-3989 (Phone)&lt; 713-646-33393 (Fax)&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   \"Martinson,&lt;&lt;   Russell\"   To:   \"'Carol St Clair'\"&lt; &lt;Carol.St.Clair@enron.com&lt;&lt;   &lt;RMartins@Util   cc:&lt;&lt;   iCorp.com&lt;   Subject:   RE: Utilicorp&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;   05/16/2000&lt;&lt;   02:05 PM&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Carol, I wasn't able to open the images you attached to your email, but&lt; both&lt; the ISDA and the Transfer and Termination Agreement are dated May 3, 2000.&lt; The only possible concern would be those transactions that we are entering&lt; into between May 3 and the day that the UtiliCorp ISDA is executed, at&lt; which&lt; time we will actually enter into trades as UtiliCorp.   However, I believe&lt; that we have worded the Transfer and Termination Agreement in such a&lt; manner&lt; that, once such document is executed, all trades done as ARM will fall&lt; under&lt; the UtiliCorp ISDA, so there shouldn't be any concerns.&lt;&lt; I anticipate having the ISDA Transfer and Termination Agreement executed&lt; within the week.   Feel free to let me know if you you have further&lt; questions/concerns.&lt;&lt; &lt; ---&lt; &lt; From:   Carol St Clair[SMTP:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com]&lt; &lt; Sent:   Friday, May 12, 2000 5:05 PM&lt; &lt; To:   RMartins@utilicorp.com&lt; &lt; Subject:   Re: Utilicorp&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt;File: pic078880.pcx&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;File: pic20420.pcx&lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Russell:&lt; &lt; Please see the e-mails that Susan and I have exchanged.

This draft is virtually the same as the other waiver letters I have prepared for ENA over the years, with the notable exception of the acknowledgement that certain LLGM lawyers can review the insurance status of the policy for ACE from an insurance status standpoint.   As you know, I was not particularly thrilled about having us perform that role, but I understand that this issue was vented in considerable detail a week or so ago and agreed to by both parties.   Please let me know if this letter is acceptable to you.   If it is, perhaps you could just reply to this e-mail and I can then forward an original to you via fax for your signature.   If you have any questions, please call me.   Thanks very much for your time and consideration in this respect.   And, thanks for providing us   with the opportunity to work with you on this project.John\"This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may be protected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

Can you add language to the Coastal Guaranty that takes care of this instead.   I would prefer to say in paragraph 9 of the Engage US amendment that \"The Guaranty of Party B dated as of May 19, 19997, heretofore delivered by UEI Holdings Inc., formerly known as Union Energy Inc. in favor of Party A as beneficiary, is hereby replaced by an executed Guaranty from Coastal Corporation, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B but only with respect to the obligations of party B under the Master Agreement that are guaranteed thereunder.\"   Let me know what you think.

You asked to see a copy...Background: Enron and Bombardier developed a promotional campaign to help sell snowmobiles.   Retail customers who purchased snowmobiles from various retail vendors by October 1 were eligible for a $1,000 rebate from Bombardier if the subsequent November-March snowfall was less than 1/2 the average of the previous 3 years.   In October, Bombardier reported to us the number of snowmobile sales in each city covered under our program and paid us a predetermined premium for each unit sold.   In return, Enron was liable for potential payouts in each of the cities covered under the program (different payouts in each city depending on the number of Bombardier units that were sold in each city).The settlement date for the program was June 14 - allowing for true-ups by the various weather services.   As of this date, we were responsible for payouts in 6 cities.   We sent prompt payment to Bombardier.Current Issue:   Bombardier has requested that we send a letter to to them, on our letterhead, specifying the actual Nov-Mar snowfall amount in each city covered under our contract with them.   They plan to forward this letter to the stores that sold Bombardier snowmobiles under this program.   The impetus for this letter is that some customers in cities where snowfall exceeded the strike (no rebate payments due to customers) thought/think that they may be entitled to a rebate.Here is the letter:Of course, I am waiting for your response before I send this letter out.Regards,Gary Taylorx315111\n"

Chris G. and Mary C.   Under the PPSA jurisdictions in Canada, which includes Alberta and Ontario among others, cash held on deposit as collateral is not clearly categorized as \"money\" but more likely an \"account\".   Although certain categories of collateral can be perfected by possession, including \"money\", \"intangibles\", which includes \"accounts\", cannot be perfected by possession.   The issue comes down to whether we will accept the risk that a wire transfer to an account designated by us constitutes \"money\".   Although it is not clear, the better view is that \"money\" means cash in hand and not on deposit.   The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to various parties, including a bankruptcy trustee and to subsequently taken but properly perfected security interests.   I will admit, however, that this seems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely unknowingly).   Accordingly, to perfect the \"account\" a registration is likely required at the PPR, which is something we do not want to get into. Even then, as an \"account\" is an \"intangible\" certain conflicts rules for perfection by registration need to be considered, as the PPSA jurisdictions provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of its principal place of business or chief executive office. i.e.   registration may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.   Further, an advance search would have to be done to see if there are competing prior registrations.   Also, as the PPR is not a guaranteed title registry, registration priority does not necessarily guarantee security priority, and law firms will not typically give priority opinions under the PPSA.   Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit holding institution will assert rights of set off over the account.In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my knowledge changed.   I suppose there is some possibility that a court has recently determined that \"money\" includes deposits that we are not aware of, and I could ask outside counsel to research this issue.Peter.

This has been a great outlet for me and a way to get back into shape which will take some time.   Arthur is still very much into tennis and starting to play competitively.   I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he keeps it up.   As for Charles, he's now 13 lbs., 6 ounces and almost 23 inches long.   I have stopped breast-feeding and started bottle feeding him which seems to work better particularly at night.   He now wakes up usually just once at night and I'm starting to get more sleep which is nice.Don't worry about waking anybody up when you call here.   Bill is usually here and Charles doesn't sleep much during the day anyway.   I've thought about coming up to the office a few times but   with Bill's schedule, Arthur's tennis and my tennis, I just haven't found a day that works.

I do not know The New Power Company; Brant would probbaly be the best person to review the credit and determine if we are OK with the assignment.   Why are they sending us \"notification\" - don't they need to obtain our consent?Thanks,Tanya   Carol St Clair   07/10/2000 02:35 PMTo: Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Columbia assignmentTanya:When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or come over to us?   The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was not part of our acquisition.   Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?Carol\n"

The idea is that there is a $50MM aggregate threshold for the counterparty.   The ISDA will be a normal ISDA - with a $50MM threshold.   The Master Physical will be the document that needs to be customized to the new concept.   The Master Physical threshold language is to simply read that there is a $50MM threshold less any exposure under the ISDA collateral threshold.   I understood that Stacy or Jeff would adapt the Master Physical to address any legal language differences in the contracts   - i.e. \"Exposure\", \"Termination Amounts\" etc.   Your team needs only to provide the ISDA to Stacy Dickson's group, and I believe they will draft the Master Physical to their comfort level.   Please call me to confirm whether or not you need anything else on this   - and whether or not you think it can go out today.   Thanks,John   Carol St Clair   06/16/2000 05:13 PMTo: Brad Schneider/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Susan Bailey/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: EnergenBrad and John:We have not sent out the ISDA draft on energen because I need calrification on the following points:1. Is the $75MM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MM cap amount?2. How does the $50MM collateral threshold work?   I noticed in the physical master that it appears as if we subtract from the $50MM threshold our exposure under the ISDA to arrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although the language in the physical says \"the exposure\" and it is not clear whose exposure they are talking about.   Is that how it is supposed to work?Carol\n"

      "body": "\nStacy:I spoke with John about this.   I think in the Master Physical language we need to do 2 things to the existing language:1. Clarify that the exposure that is being subtracted from $50M is ENA's Exposure.   The defined term in the ISDA is \"Exposure\".2. Clarify that Counterparty's threshold is zero if as a result of subtracting ENA's Exposure from $50M you get a negative number.We will go ahead and draft the multi-product guaranty and copy you on the draft that we send out.Carol---"

He is looking into what issues need to be reviewed/discussed.   According to Carol there are no open issues.   If that is the case can we send executed copy's of the ISDA to him for signature.   Before it is sent off, we need to make sure the correct changes have been made to the Credit Annex, as the credit support provider has changed from my original credit worksheet.   I am not sure if Carol had made those changes in her drafts.2) Engage Energy Canada, LPAccording to the Lotus Notes Database, the draft amendment of this contract was also sent to Luke, although he is the US lawyer.   A draft needs to be sent to the Canadian Lawyer, Suzzi Sethi 403-297-0348.   She sent us a draft guaranty for review with the guarantor West Coast Gas Inc.   This counterparty is the new guarantor for Engage Canada and the ISDA Credt Annex needs to be updated accordingly.   Once again, we need to make sure the Credit information is still correct in the original draft.   I have given a copy of the guaranty to Tana, can you please review this and provide your comments to Suzzi.Please let me know if you require any additional information.Thank you,Russell   Carol St Clair   08/04/2000 111:58 AMTo: Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Cook/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: Engage   Russell:I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.

They are still insisting on a exclusion of \"consequential losses\" from the indemnity given clause 4(a) of the ETA. Two questions Do we have a position on agreeing to exclude consquential losses from this clause? My own view is in this instance it is going to be somewhat \"hit and miss\" as what would be a consequential loss and what is not. That being said the general Enron position is to exclude consequential losses. In fact such a provision is already in the GTCs in respect of any Transaction.   Hence if there was a Transaction consequentiallossess would then presumably be excluded in respect of a related breach of the ETA.   Utilicorp is a substantial equity holder in United Energy. I understand they are trading through EnronOnline. Do we know what they have agreed?   ---",

Two additional points;I believe it is best for us   to move to replace the Deemed ISDA Agreement. This will provide a cleaner contractual basis for EnronOnline trades. We should be able to settle a   ISDA   Master Agreement quite swiftly   using the existing commercial terms in the Deemed ISDA. If you are concur with this course of action we will forward to you tomorrow   a Schedule   for   review.   In respect of Section 4(b) of the ETA we would be agreeable to add the following at its end:   \"unless such access, entry, omission or action arises from acts or omissions of Enron and its directors, officers, employees, agents or contractors.'''

Let me respond to the points you raised.Deemed ISDA Agreement- We would be most happy to provide a letter that you could aknowledge that the Deemed ISDA Agreement is a master agreement for the purposes of the ETA. I would prefer not to make a formal amendment as this may exclude a subsequent Master Agreement from applying.Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd. is the Enron counterparty for all Australian power trades. If that is your preference then access can be limited to only those products. You could write to us stating this is your position. However, we have found that counterparties have not found this necessary. Your EnronOnline Master User will set access levels for your individual traders. Many counterparties appoint a person from their Controls group (not a Trader) as their Master User.   This gives them the flexibility to broaden/ reduce access themselves.Excluding \"consequential loss\" in this circumstance is quite broad but if we could work through some scenarios hopefully we could find some words to accomodate your concerns.When we last spoke you mentioned the concern here was the possibility that   the password may be disclosed from other than a UE source ie Enron. I have talked this issue through with our systems people as to the nature of this exposure. What happens is that the password which is issued to a user is immediately changed after it is received from Enron. Hence the source of the password must be the relevant counterparty. Whether improper use is a result of the counterparty's negilence or some other cause such as an unauthorised use or disclosure by one of its personnel is not relevant. What is of concern that the loss would have resulted from or arose out of a Counterparty's \"access to or utilisation of the Website\".   Perhaps you would give me a call so we may discuss any outstanding points.David MinnsSenior Legal CounselPhone 612 92229 2310Fax   612 92229 2350   \"Creek, Peggy\" &lt;pcreek@ue.com.au&lt; on 03/31/2000 12:45:47 PMTo: \"'david.minns@enron.com'\" &lt;david.minns@enron.com&lt;cc:   Subject: EnronOnlineDavidFurther to our conversation this week regarding our outstanding issues inthe Electronic Trading Agreement, UE suggests the following way foreward.Enron sends a letter to UE to be countersigned.

The Agreement provides in Section 3 that \"each Company . . . will furnish to such other Company   . . . one or more of the Goods . . .\" and that \"[a]ll Goods provided hereunder shall be priced at cost . . .\"   Thus, the Agreement provides that the Service Company can buy power and sell it to a utility at cost.   It does not expressly provide that the Service Company can act as agent on behalf of the utilities in purchasing or selling power on their behalf.I wanted to confirm that there was no other documentation available that more clearly identified the authority of GPU Services to act as agent on behalf of the utilities.   In the absence of such documentation, I propose language to add to the Electronic Trading Agreement to address my concerns.   I would also like to have each of the utilities sign a short acknowledgment form acknowledging the authority of GPU Service Company to enter into transactions with EPMI on its behalf.   Attached below please find my proposed revisions to the Letter Agreement amending the ETA (which was originally forwarded to you by Carol St. Clair) as well as the proposed Acknowledgment.I look forward to discussing any questions or comments you may have.Regards,Leslie Hansen713-853-6121 cchoate@gpu.com\t05/18/2000 08:18 AM \t\t\t To: \"Leslie Hansen\" &lt;Leslie.Hansen@enron.com&lt;\t\t\t cc: jroberts@gpu.com\t\t\t Subject: Re: Enron OnlineLeslie: The Mutual Assistance Agreement that was sent to you was filed with thePa PUC .

Physical trades in US will be with Enron NA other than in Texas where   is will be Houston Pipeline Company(please can you clarify this aspect   for gas moving out of Texas on interstate pipelines)   Physical trades in Canada will be with Enron Canada The first sentence is correct.   Physical NATURAL GAS trades in US will be with Enron North America for locations   outside of Texas and Houston Pipeline Company for locations within Texas.   Physical NATURAL GAS trades in Canada   can be with either Enron North America or Enron Canada Corp, depending on the location.   3.All financial deals will be governed by the cargill/Enron ISDA   agreement presently being negotiated Once executed, the ISDA signed be Cargill and Enron will govern any financial trades entered into by the   entities that signed this agreement.   4.Physical deals will be governed by the executed GISB agreement in   place   Physical NATURAL GAS deals, entered into by the entities that executed a GISB agreement, will be governed by   said agreement.   5.Cargill will need to have two accounts to differentiate Cargill Inc   from Cargill Canada Yes   Given the above summary, Cargill will look to set up two accounts as   per (5) above, to commence trading with Enron-online.   If you have any comments on above or can speed the setting up of our   accounts, please feel free to e.mail me back today   Regards   Alastair Riach - Trading manager Natural Gas   (tel 612 984 3021) - C.DTF - C.DTF\n"

We will be rolling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaii 125-0 structure.   We are not sure if the current structure will be unwound completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaii structure or if the current Alchemy entities will be used.   Regardless, I'm fairly sure that the original swap will be unwound and a new confirmation will be done using the Hawaii Master Agreement.   We are hoping to close by May 31st. 2. Resco II/McGarret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in the Hawaii Structure.   EES has requested that we put additional warrants of an entity they call Resco into the Hawaii structure.   This should close around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarret A documents for the 3/31 transaction to Sara today.That is all we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals.   Blackbird has been put on indefinite hold. I will keep you posted on any other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.Call if you need any more info.   I will make sure you are on the distribution list for docs.Thanks,B\n"

It's not one of my better days.   I also found out I have to have a root canal, 8 crowns, a fortune will be spent.   Anyway, she said the crown stuff would take 4 hours, which means 6-8, so I was wondering if you thought it better for me to take off when you guys weren't around.   The week of July 17th, you'll be gone, Mary will be on vacation and Dan will be on vacation.   Would that be a good time for me to be gone too since it'll be quiet.   I have a lot of decay and need to get this over and done with soon.   After that's done, I should be finished except for routine cleanings.   She's already done both side of my mouth.   Now, it's the front that has to be done.   I wanted to get your input before I started scheduling appointments where I'll have to be out an entire day.

As you may know, I have been out since July 12th on maternity leave/extended unpaid leave of absence.   My plan is to return to work on January 8th.   Here are my questions:1. I am considering coming back to work on a part time basis.   From a benefits standpoint, is there any difference between a RRH employee (30-39 hours) versus a RPT employee (20-29 hours)?   In others words, are there any benefits that I would lose if I worked part-time?The difference is in the amount of Flexdollars you would receive, as stated below: Medical Coverage Semi Monthly   FlexdollarsRRH Employee Only   123.222 Employee/Spouse 146.97 Employee/Child 137.000 Employee/family 165.25RPT Employee Only   82.15 Employee/Spouse 97.98 Employee/Child 91.34 Employee/family 1110.172. Given the fact that I am not returning until January 8th, am I still eligible for any stock option grant program that the company may institute at year-end?   That is currently under discussion in developing the new Stock Option program.   However, they are leaning towards allowing individuals in your situation to be apart of the program.Is there any additional paper-work that I need to submit to keep me eligible?   No.Both my immediate boss, Mark Taylor and our general counsel, Mark Haedicke are aware of the fact that I am not returning back to work until January, 20001.3. Our bank account has been recently changed.   I pulled down the \"Direct Deposit Authorization\" form and I am assuming that all I need to do is to fill it out and send it back to you.   Is that correct?   Yes, please send to EB3698What is your office location?4. As I get closer to my return date, is there any paperwork that needs to be submitted to notify payroll of my return since I am currently not being paid? No.   Your time will be change coding from LOA without pay to Active time.I look forward to hearing from you either by phone or e-mail.   My home phone number is 281-890-71222.Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral Threshold definition.   2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way you suggested with   additional language that states that any drop below BB- also counts as a trigger.3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective rate which my credit person is thinking about.4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that your comment is correct.5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to $5000,000 and to limit \"returns\" of collateral to once a week.   We cannot agree to change   the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.   Given the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.7.

I met with our credit people this morning and can respond to some of the credit points raised in your May 16th memo:1. With respect to item #2, I know of no case law on this point and our credit group cannot agree to delete this concept from the Collateral Threshold definition.   2. With respect to item #3, we can agree to define materially weaker the way you suggested with   additional language that states that any drop below BB- also counts as a trigger.3. With respect to item #4, we can agree to a definition tied to an objective rate which my credit person is thinking about.4. With respect to item #6, I'm waiting for my credit person to confirm that your comment is correct.5. I understand from your latest e-mail that no changes will be made to the definition and use of affiliates in any of the agreements.6. With respect to item #12, we can agree to increase our rounding amount to $5000,000 and to limit \"returns\" of collateral to once a week.   We cannot agree to change   the frequency for requesting/delivering collateral.   Given the high rounding intervals, we feel that unless there is a huge market change, it is unlikely that collateral requests will be made every day.7. With respect to item #14, there is no requirement to escrow cash collateral that is being held and the Secured Party is free to do whatever it wants to with the cash until the events in 13(g)(ii) occur, in which case the cash collateral must be held by a Qualified Institution.8. With respect to item #19, if we draw the entire amount of the LC and the termination amount that we are owed is less than the LC amount, we would be required under the documents to return any excess amount to you.

Can you sense that I am getting restless already?   I am really going to try hard to stay in contact with you and others there because I have discovered that talking to you and the others on the phone or by e-mail gives me a lift.   Charles is doing well.   I am a little frustrated with the schedule that we are on which seems to vary from day to day but hopefully things will approach normalcy in a few weeks.   we met our new pediatrician this past week and we both really like him.   Charles checked out fine.   He had gained over a pound since leaving the hospital so I am happy that he appears to be getting enough to eat.   My parents and sister are coming around Sept. 23rd for the christening and I am looking forward to that.   Please mark your calendar for that Sunday as I think that we will have something at the house and I very much want you and Ric to come and meet everyone.Alos, if people want to visit me here at the house ask them to call me.   I would very much like to see them if they want to stop by.I can't believe that I actually miss work but I do.   Hopefully, in a few weeks I acn make some type of proposal to Mark but it is too soon now to do so and I'm not sure that I could fit it in.   Alos, Mark mentioned that I should be getting something in the mail about some stock options that I apparently received recently.   Could you please be on the look-out for it?   I'm not sure whther all of the lawyers got some so please keep this quiet (which I know you will).As for Bill's mother, she turns 80 this week and everyone in the family except Bill and I is going to Florida next weekend for a visit.   I told Bill that he could go but he decided not to.   We bought her some really pretty (and expensive) earrings which I hope she will like.   She has not yet given us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are still in the doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past week.   I really don't care what she thinks because it was the right thing to do.Well, I've got to go.   hope you had a good weekend and feel free to stop by for a visit.Carol\tSuzanne Adams\t07/27/000 05:34 PM \t\t\t To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Re: InvoiceHow are things going at home?

I'm seeing in the credit system that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I need clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.   Secondly, is there a Master ISDA Agreement governing those swaps?   In pulling the mtm monthly breakout, it appears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MM US and the liquidation of that portfolio occurs mostly in cal '02.Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to look into the potential of setting off financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.   Kaiser is looking at other businesses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.In summary, we need to answer at minimum the following:? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how quickly this out-of-the-money position can move? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or Master ISDA)? what credit/legal terms and laws may affect our efforts to establish a Netting Agreement for UK and US financialCan you help me in coordinating a meeting with London legal/credit and Portland credit/Houston legal to discuss pertinent issues associated with a Netting Agreement between Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as soon as possible.   Please let me know your thoughts to the above and who we need to contact to get the above points addressed.   In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the drafting of such a Netting Agreement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton about the concept as well.Please let me know as soon as possible your comments to the above and in setting up a conference call to push this forward.Thanks,Tracy\n"

Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (\"Kaiser International\") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, affiliate NETTING AGREEMENT between Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?   If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals business with Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage off of it for trading liquidity in the states.   Secondly, does the netting need to just pertain to global financial business or can it include physical as well?If possible, I'd like to see if you and a UK trading attorney can speak about the overall concept and briefly address any UK and domestic law conflicts.   Please call when you have a opportunity to discuss.   ENA is looking to enter into a power swap for June '01.   I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.   However, if we can't do a June swap, then we'll try for a July swap.Regards,Tracy\n"

Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\tLeslie Hansen\t06/28/2000 02:53 PM \t\t\t To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t cc: \t\t\t Subject: Legal risk factors for DashCarol:Gaurav asked me to summarize all relevant risks associated with the Reliable Power Product for the Dash.   Please let me know if you think I should add or revise anything:1.   Section 8.3 indemnity obligation --- We are required to indemnify the insurer from any third party claims arising out of the insurer's performance under the policy except for a claim by a swap counterparty based upon our refusal to pay out on the swap because the insurer denied coverage.   We hope to have a one-year limitation on this obligation; however, this limitation would be subject to tolling in an insolvency situation.2.   The insurer is permitted to revoke coverage for up to one year if there is a fraud or material misrepresentation or omission by ENA in obtaining coverage.   (The current version of the policy also provides for revocation if the insurer subsequently discovers fraud on the part of the swap counterparty.   However, we intend to eliminate this from the insurance policy if possible.)   ENA is not limited to the group of employees administering the auction but rather includes the entire organization.   Therefore, we could pay out on a swap to a counterparty after the insurer had approved coverage and face a situation where the insurer changed its mind and decided to deny coverage based on, e.g., a material omission by ENA in failing to provide relevant information relating to coverage at the time the claim was presented.   Absent counterparty fraud, we would not be able to go back to our counterparty and demand reimbursement on the swap.3.   Credit risk --- The insurer fails to pay out upon the occurrence of an Insured Event while we are required to pay out to our swap counterparty in the underlying swap.4.   Loss adjustment credit risk --- If the price we use to pay a counterparty under the swap is subsequently corrected by the floating price source, we may be require to make a payment to our counterparty under the swap before the insurer makes a payment to us for the loss adjustment.   However, if the price adjustment results in a refund being owed to us by our counterparty, we may have to pay the insurer the amount of the refund before we actually get a refund from our counterparty.5.   Under Section 6.1(b), the insurer can deny coverage based upon any breach of our duties under the policy.   For instance, if we fail to comply with the notice requirements for presenting a claim, we forego our right to coverage.   However, we will still be required to pay out on the underlying swap.   Leslie\n"

The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services --- all of our midmarket   forms anticipate that we will act as customer's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&amp;D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and pass those amounts on to the customer's utility.2.

If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision, we will do so.3.   The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form --- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great difficulty selling it in the past).   Taking into consideration this class of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a \"force majeure event\" in an effort to soften the approach (see the GTCs).

This is the part of tennis that I really don't like.   I've had numerous email conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist.   Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest.   One of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation, and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season.   This evidently happened to her team two years ago.   (I think she's rationalizing after-the-fact.)You probably know that this person---that lodged the \"protest\"---is Betsie Hollis.   She's my women's team captain.   I've called her on the carpet about this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is hurting me, too.   She did try to withdraw her \"protest,\" but Cheryl had evidently already taken action.   There are so many people out there that are mis-ranked.   The fellow playing with Kelly last Sunday should not be a 3.5...the woman we played against should not be a 3.5...Elise Shepherd should not be a 4.5...and on and on.   I have heard through Roger White---Rice U's womens coach and a USTA verifier---that they are slowly trying to rectify mis-rankings by looking more closely at league and tournament results.   I think you may be the first casualty of this endeavor.Bill Hunt has all sorts of counter-arguments.   He had Cheryl's approval to play you in mixed at 4.0.   Maybe if we promise to play you with our weaker 4.0 men---who are borderline 3.5 material---they'd let it pass.   Who knows.   If we are going to lose you---and Chris after this week---we're going to be pretty weak, not to mention demoralized.After all, we're all just trying to have some fun on the tennis court.   Speaking of which, this Sunday is Chris' last match before his big move to North Carolina.   We're out at Lee LeClear.   I don't remember if you or Bill are scheduled to play, but please join us for a little send-off celebration after the match if you can.---sarah\n"

It's really not too bad and sometimes I take a nap in the late afternoon with him.   I'm still breast feeding but my doctor said it would be okay to supplement with formula so at midday he gets a bottle which allows Bill and I to get out of the house for lunch most of the time.   I'm still running/walking in the mornings and with Bill at night and i really enjoy the break.   I just can't stay in the house all day and night.   Arthur started school yesterday and we've enrolled him in a fall tennis camp twice a week.   He has really shown an interest in tennis and i hope it continues.   I hope to get back on the court in a few weeks but that seems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably because of the stopping and staring and the quick side to side movements.Bill has been very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although there is not much he can do in terms of feeding Charles since that's up to me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are sick of each other.   Once I start bottle feeding he will be able to do more.Hope all is well with you.   I hope to maybe be up for a visit next week if I can find a time that works.   I'll let you know.

Looking over the spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which counterparties we consider \"Credit Concerns\", where you would then prioritize on your end.   Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we consider them to be \"Good Credits\" (for example Duke).   Once again, financial exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.   Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated for more than a week, at the max.Let me know how you want to go about this.   I think if I highlight which counterparties we feel you should look into, this would go a lot faster.Regards---VE\n"

Deletion of the Termination Event in Section (j)&amp;copy;.   If we have to choose between this and the covenant that you inserted in Part 5, I would much rather have this but I don't understand why we can't have both.2. In the new language that you added in the \"Recording\" section, I don't think that I can agree to the reasonable expectation language unless we make it clear here that it would be reasonable to expect that any call that is made to or from our trading floor will be recorded.   Also, at the very beginning where it says \"that originates from and\" the word \"and\" needs to be \"or\" to cover the situation in our case where someone from your side that is not on the trading floor calls our trading floor.3. In Part 5, Section (o) the last sentence, please change the word \"herein\" to \"this Agreement\" and please change the last reference to \"the Existing Transactions\" to \"this Agreement\" as I thought that this is what we agreed to.4. In the definition of MAC, in clauses (a)(ii) and (b)(ii), please change the word \"either\" to \"both\" and the word \"or\" to \"and\", as I thought this is what we agreed to.5.

Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 15th by e-mail.   I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from her.   Most of her comments we could not accept.   None of her comments have been run by Dave.2. Imperial Oil -   Grant Oh was handling this.   They had 3 comments. most of which we could not accept.   I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and have never heard back from him.   None of their proposed changes have been run by Dave.3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has approved was sent to them on May 15th.   My contact there is Jim Sobule   Wayne Gresham is alos involved in this.   I have never heard back from Jim. 4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.   Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.   I responded   to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further on this.   None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick   on January 31st which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.   Dave has not reviewed their comments or my response.6. Cargill - I sent to Mike Pederson a form of amendment letter which I don't think has been signed.   They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality language.   Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th which Dave approved.   To my knowledge, it has not been signed.9. Talisman - we have been exchanging drafts of a revised ETA for months.   My contact there is Ann Love.   We are close to reaching agreement with them and mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.   I am sending to Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my directory under specproj/online.Carol\n"

Met is on the 6th floor.   I can meet anytime around lunch - I'll go ahead and get court for 111:30, but if you want to meet later, that would be fine - just let me know.

I'm happy to report that we are all home now and except for a lack of sleep, we are all doing well.   I ended up having Charles Eugene by C-section and then had to spend the next 5 days in the hospital while they tried to figure out why he was breathing erratically.   They ran all sorts of tests on him (including a spinal tap) and the good news is that he just had some fluid in his lungs which he didn't get rid of as part of the birthing process.   He is okay now and a true joy!   Arthur and Bill have been a big help.   It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.   Arthur visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.   They spoiled him to death but I was thrilled that he made the trip there and wished we could do that more often.   As for me, I hope to take from now until the end of the year off from work and then decide what I want to do.   I'm looking forward to the extended leave even though most of it will be unpaid but it will be worth it and hopefully Charles will benefit from it.How are things with you?   Have you seen the shore house?   It is quite a place.   I'm hoping that mom and sue will come for a visit in late August.   Sue is Charles' godmother.Well I need to get back to the baby.   stay in touch and thanks again for thinking of us.   Pictures will come soon.

It was NOT fun at all, but I made it through. It's nice to know the worst is over.   My temporaries look pretty good too.   I still have to go by the lab and do a couple of other things, but my permanent teeth should be put in on August 18th.   I'm just going to take the day too because lord only knows how long it'll take!   Then I'm finished until next year!   Whew!I'll figure up 4 weeks of sick time and then I'll do your vacation and then do 4 more weeks of sick time.   I emailed Michelle Word from your email if the 8 weeks were all 1000% paid, so if you get that email, be sure and let me know what she says.   I'm trying to get you 8 weeks at 1000% pay.   It's pretty quiet around here so far today.   Dan's birthday is next Monday and we are going to take him to lunch and I'm getting him cigars (of course).   Mine is also coming up so Ric is going to take me to Pappas Steakhouse.   I've never been there and have been wanting to go.   He's already made the reservations and everything.   I can't believe I'm going to be 45!!!   My body feels every year though!How are you adjusting?   Charles sleeping any longer?   Keep in touch.

I have volunteered as a campaigner for the United Way here at ENRON because I wanted to give-back to the organization that was instrumental in my father's comfort during his hospice.   I hope that you   will join me in achieving Ken Lay's goal of 1000% participation by Wednesday, August 23.   ENRON has created a home page making it very convenient to make a pledge.   Please take a FEW minutes and visit http:///unitedway.enron.com to make your confidential pledge.   If you experience any problems entering the system please contact me at X57373 immediately.   We are in the process of ironing out a 'glitche' or two.   Remember, No gift is too small.Thank your for your consideration.\n"

Last week Rod and I spoke abut this, and his view is a little different. He believes there could be some exposure if the same counterparty transacts both on-line and off-line; however, there are ways to limit the transactions and very probably the likelihood of that happening is very little.   He was going to put together an opinion froom their side, and I suggest we have a conference call wednesday morning...I am traveling wednesday but reachable through my assistant Barbara. 0111-452-8-152-2404.   PLease call any time is convenient for you so we can discuss this matter and also talk to your counsel.Thanks and regards.

Alos, who from credit are you dealing with and are they aware that we probably will not be able to in a bankruptcy situation offset amounts owed with respect to the online and offline transactions?

On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.   My understanding is that he will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those accounts.   Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the Transfer Agreement to become effective.   Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.   Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.   Either Susan or I will let you know when that date is.Please call me at 333989 if you have any questions.Carol\n"

One thing though - did the revised   Fallback Reference Weather Station language get finalized? I was working with Dave Kistler on this and have not heard anything from him on this in over a month. You might check w/ him or Mark Tawney to make sure that we include the most recent wording. One last query - how is the Confirm Desk going to know whether we have included the language as part of the ISDA Master?   They also need to keep in mind that with some CP's, such as American Re - we have agreed special wording with them and so will have to continue using the longer version of confirmation.

Looking over the spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which counterparties we consider \"Credit Concerns\", where you would then prioritize on your end.   Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we consider them to be \"Good Credits\" (for example Duke).   Once again, financial exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.   Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated for more than a week, at the max.Let me know how you want to go about this.

Looking over the spreadsheet itself, I would be able to tell you right off which counterparties we consider \"Credit Concerns\", where you would then prioritize on your end.   Even though some counterparties may high high exposures, we consider them to be \"Good Credits\" (for example Duke).   Once again, financial exposures vary (sometimes very significantly) from one day to the next.   Therefore the totals you'll have for current exposures will not be validated for more than a week, at the max.Let me know how you want to go about this.

Section 5. ---   I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a non-Mexican entity to offer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties where such countparties are \"vetted\" before trading commences.   It seems that, for so long as derivatives are not offered to the public at-large, then such an offerings can be made.2.   Section 9&amp;copy; --- A withholding tax, as well as value-added tax, will apply to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant to certain financial derivative transactions.   In addition, a non-Mexican entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty will be required to pay Mexican value-added tax pursuant to those certain transactions.   (Please refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided to me by Jaime Williams will not be subject to any Mexican withholding or VAT tax since they fall outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such payments to Mexican tax.)   I have been working extensively with Mexican tax counsel on these issues, so please consider Rich, Heather y Mueller's \"No\" response as relevant only to a tax applicable to transactions conducted through the internet (and not with respect to the underlying transaction).Please call me at ext. 35777 with any questions.Best regards.

We will agree to $1000,000,000 for both parties3. It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.   As a compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.4. Item #4 is fine.5. Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces the collateral threshold to zero.6. I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing Guarantys.7. Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.8. I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10   CSA COMMENTS1. Item #1 is fine2. We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 203. I would like to discuss item #3 with youAlso, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault termination was not in our draft, but in yours).   Could you please e-mail me your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the changes?   With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter agree to that.

      "body": "\nRobert:I am still waiting to hear back from our credit person on some of the credit comments that you made, but here is my response to the legal and certain of the credit comments:1. I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.   I would like to talk to you about the second paragraph.2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Loss rather than Market Quotation.3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.   In addition. our tax people are now advising us to require the delivery of W-9's to part 3.4. NY is okay with governing law.5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go with our language and really didn't see much difference in what you sent other than the fact that it was more abbreviated. Did I miss something?6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Business Days is too long.   How about 5?7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is too narrow for us.   We can agree that any calls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing and financial/credit personnel will be recorded.   Does that work for you?8. Insert 7 is okay.9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,   10. Your comments on page 4 of Annex A are okay.111. Your comment on Annex A, page 5 is problematic for us unless we limit posted collateral to LC's only.   12. On page 6 of Annex A, can we include both the Issuer and the pledgor?13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining comments on page 7 of Annex A except that we need Moody's because it is used in the LC language.14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put \"either the Issuer or X\" and in 1(b) include your language as an alternative?15. I need to discuss with you your deletion of clause (ii) of 1(d).   We would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occurred and if no payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash collateral.16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in Section 2 of the Guaranty.17. Inserts 10, 111 and 12 are okay.   18. In Section 6&amp;copy;, I would like to keep that phrase as it refers to the Payment Demand procedure.19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.20. We can change governing law to NY but as a matter of enron policy, cannot agree to Insert 13.21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer that this applies in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding. I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum Transfer Amount comment, the LC transfer language comment and the language of Insert 9.   I look forward to hearing from you.   I will not be in the office monday or tuesday.   Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to include the following language at the end of Part 6.   Sorry for the late notice. Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

Allegheny energy - Patricia Clark sent to Frank Davis her comments on June 15th by e-mail.   I responded on June 19th and have never heard back from her.   Most of her comments we could not accept.   None of her comments have been run by Dave.2. Imperial Oil -   Grant Oh was handling this.   They had 3 comments. most of which we could not accept.   I spoke with Grant about this around June 6th and have never heard back from him.   None of their proposed changes have been run by Dave.3. Kennecott Coal Sales Company - A draft amendment letter which Dave F. has approved was sent to them on May 15th.   My contact there is Jim Sobule   Wayne Gresham is alos involved in this.   I have never heard back from Jim. 4. Arco - We received by e-mail comments from David Dyck at Arco in March.   Tori Kuykendall and Grant Oh are involved from the Enron side.   I responded   to David Dyck by e-mail on March 10th and have never heard anything further on this.   None of their comments or my response has been reviewed by Dave.5. Chevron - Canada - I received a letter from Bruce Borwick   on January 31st which I responded to and have never heard anything further from them.

They wanted a minor change to the confidentiality language.   Dave has not seen this but in the event that Cargill comes back to life, i doubt that he will have a problem with it.7. Cinergy - I sent a draft amendment letter which dave approved to John Dirheimer on May 15th.   To my knowledge it has not been signed.8. Duke Energy - I sent a draft amendment letter to John Puett on May 15th which Dave approved.   To my knowledge, it has not been signed.9.

We are close to reaching agreement with them and mark has been involved in some of the early discussions.   I am sending to Dave a mark-up of the revised agreement for his approval.All of the ETA amendment letters and the Talisman revised ETA are in my directory under specproj/online.Carol\n"

Determine whether an issuer can refuse to honor a draw made under a surety bond if after issuance, it determines that the bond was issued in violation of the appleton statute.   What type of legal comfort should we receive from the issuer at the outset to get comfortable that the bond was validly issued and is enforceable against such issuer?2. Determine the proper minimum credit rating(s) that should apply to the issuer.3. In the form of bond that we were given, the \"Now Therefore\" language in the third paragraph is not acceptable.   Determine what can be said in its place to establish the necessary linkage back to the transaction covered by the Confirmation.4. Make sure that the bond can be drawn down no matter what type of Event of Default occurs, even if such event is not related to the transaction that the bond references.   The Notice of Claim language needs to be written more generically to accommodate this. 5. Does credit need a \"pre-bankruptcy\" trigger that would require Reliant to convert all outstanding bonds into LC's or cash collateral?   If so, what would this trigger be?Let me know if you have any additional issues.   I will be discussing some of these with our outside counsel shortly.

They are in the process of reviewing the online documents and will get back to me sometime next week with any thoughts or recommendations.   One area that we will need to be careful in is in how we market Enron Online for there are restrictions in connection with the offering of \"securities\".   While it is fairly clear that commodity based derivatives are not securities   there may be other products where it is not so clear cut.   I think that it would be very helpful if you would send to Jose and Pablo the Online materials (i.e, brochures etc.) that we would plan to send to prospective counterparties so that we can make sure that our marketing efforts don't violate any restrictions taht we would be subject to.

Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the Transfer Agreement to become effective.   Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.   Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.

They are as follows:\r 1.   Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives (\"91-504\") and the=\r=20\rcorresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.   At this=20\rtime, 91-504 is merely a proposal.   In addition to checking the Ontario=20\rSecurities Commission (\"OSC\") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=\rt=20\rbrought the \"securities representation\" issue to our attention and he has=\r=20\rconfirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20\rannouncements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such=\r=20\radoption.\r 2.   Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade=\r=20\rwith Enron Canada Corp. (\"Enron Canada\") is likely to be considered a \"trad=\re=20\rwithin Alberta\" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head=\r=20\roffice and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).   As a=\r=20\rresult, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta=\r=20\rsecurities law.\r 3.   In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a \"trade\" can take place in =\ra=20\rnumber of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. =\r=20\rAlthough it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be=\r=20\rmade in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.   With the exception o=\rf=20\rBritish Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20\rsimilar \"blanket orders\", \"policies\" or \"rules\" with respect to this issue.=\r =20\rHowever, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=\rhe=20\rforefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20\rjurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=\r04=20\ris in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. =\r=20\rRegardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=\ra=20\rin place at this time.\r 4.   I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=\re=20\rfact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an \"OTC Derivative\"=\r=20\r(and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20\rpotentially available to them).   I can think of no reason why it would be=\r=20\rbeneficial to either party to remove this representation.\r With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and =\r3=20\rabove (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20\rprovided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act=\r=20\r(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=\rnd=20\rare, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following=\r=20\rclause:\r \"(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&amp;commodity contract=018 or an =\r=01&amp;OTC=20\rderivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=\rties=20\rlegislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20\rsecurities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the=\r=20\rTransaction, and (ii) it is a =01&amp;Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of=\r=20\rparagraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20\rparagraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order=\r=20\rBOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=\rom=20\rtime to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made=\r=20\rpursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other=\r=20\rjurisdictions having application to the Transaction;\"\r I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to=\r=20\rthe \"open-ended\" nature of the above-mentioned clause.   If we want to refer=\r=20\rto 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I=\r=20\rwould suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:\r Canadian Securities Acts.   (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&amp;OTC=\r=20\rDerivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=\rs Act=20\r(British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i=\rs=20\ra =01&amp;Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Se=\rcurities=20\rCommission Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20\rSecurities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in effect on the dat=\re=20\rhereof.\r to:\r Canadian Securities Legislation.   (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an=\r=20\r\"OTC derivative\" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities=20\rCommission Order Doc#394043 (\"ASC 394043\"), paragraph 1.1 of British Columb=\ria=20\rSecurities Commission Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC) (\"BCSC 91-501\") and/or=\r=20\rparagraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commission Rule 91-504 =01)=\r=20\rOver-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities=20\rCommission on January 7, 2000] (\"[Proposed] OSC 91-504\"), as applicable to=\r=20\rsuch Transaction, (ii) it is a \"Qualified Party\" within the meaning of=20\rparagraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in effe=\rct=20\ron the date hereof, and (ii) it is a \"qualified party\" within the meaning =\rof=20\rparagraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.\r Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed=\r=20\rlanguage above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which=\r=20\rwere drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t=\rhe=20\rAlberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alber=\rta=20\ror British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with=\r=20\rrespect to a transaction under the ISDA issues a similar order or policy, y=\rou=20\rmay want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).\r I hope this discussion is useful for you.

It was good to talk to her and get back in touch with work.   I'm still playing alot of tennis and really enjoying it.   Charles is now old enough for the daycare that our tennis club provides so Bill and I go out there quite a bit in the morning to hit which is nice.   i still don't know what my long range plans are and will probably start discussing with Bill what to do in the next few weeks.
