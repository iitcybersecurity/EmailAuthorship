I am also interested in dates when locational marginal pricing (LMP) was implemented (if at all).I was able to get dates for every market but Cinergy and ECAR. Please let me know if you can tell me who to contact, and/or if someone in Houston can dig this up for me.I don't mean to be a burden, but Jeff Borg was hoping I could come up with this for a 3:000pm meeting today.Thanks bro,Dan\n"

Cambridge, Mass.-based Off Wall Street, led by analyst Mark Robe=\rrts, thinks Enron's 20001 earnings will fall 6 cents short of the consensus =\restimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $=\r30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20.   The firm's 26-page report, publis=\rhed May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing levera=\rge and suggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple =\ras a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS :NYSE - news ), which has a 20001 p=\rrice-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 333 times. OWS also alleges tha=\rt Enron's earnings quality is poor and that key parts of its financial stat=\rements are confusing and opaque.
