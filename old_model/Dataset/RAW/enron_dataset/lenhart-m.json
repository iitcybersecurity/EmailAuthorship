One day a recruit namedMarcus walked into Jackie Sherrill's Miss. State office and saw hisGolden phone sitting there. \"Wow,\" Marcus exclaimed, \"What's that?\" Jackie responded, \"Well son, that's my Golden Phone; it's a directline to Heaven. \"Wow, that's pretty neat,\" Marcus responded. \"Doyou think I could make a call on that phone?\"   \"Well yes, but it'sgoing to cost you about $1000. You can make the check out to theMississippi State University Football Foundation,\" replied Jackie.\"That's a lot of money. I don't think I should spend that much.Thanks anyway,\" Marcus replied as he left the office.A few weeks later Marcus took a visit at the campus of TexasA&amp;M University and went into Coach R. C. Slocum 's office whereagain he saw a Golden phone.   \"What exactly is that phone for?\"asked Marcus.   Coach Slocum replied, \"That's my direct line toHeaven.\"   \"Do you think I could make a call from that phone?\"asked Marcus.   \"Well sure, but it's going to cost you about $2000,and you can make the check out to the Texas A&amp;M UniversityFoundation.\" replied Slocum.   \"Oh never mind, I don't have thatkind of money. Thanks though.\"   Marcus shook his head and leftCoach Slocum's office.The next weekend, Marcus took his official visit to Louisiana StateUniversity campus and made the office of Coach Saban his first stop.Upon arriving, the first thing Marcus noticed was the Golden phoneon Coach Saban's desk.   Marcus asked if that was a direct line toHeaven.   When Coach Saban replied that it was, Marcus again askedif he could make a call using the phone.   \"Well sure you can, but itwill cost you 35 cents,\" replied Saban.   Upon hearing this, Marcus'eyes got real big and he said, \"Really?   Then why did CoachSherrill and Coach Slocum tell me it would cost so much more?\"Coach Saban looked up from behind his desk and smiled, saying,\"Because, son, here at LSU, it's a local call.\"L S U --- GO TIGERS!!!\n"

He is always in a good&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; mood and always has something positive to say:&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, \"if I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; were any better, I would be twins!\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; He was a natural motivator.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael and asked him, \"I don't get it! You can't be a positive&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; person all of the time. How do you do it?\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael replied, \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself, youhave&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; two choices today.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in abad&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; mood.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I choose to be in a good mood.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; can choose to learn from it.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I choose to learn from it.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I choose the positive side of life.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Yeah, right, it's not that easy,\"   I protested.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Yes, it is,\"   Michael said.   \"Life is all about choices. When you&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; You choose how you react to situations. You choose how peopleaffect&lt;&lt;   &lt;your&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; mood.   You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; The bottom line:   It's your choice how you live life.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; company to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of&lt;&lt;   reacting to&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; it.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I saw Michael about six months after the accident.   When I askedhim&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; how he was, he replied. \"If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; see my scars?\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; through his mind as the accident took place.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; soon to be born daughter,\" Michael replied. \"Then, as I lay on the&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; or I could choose to die. I chose to live.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?\" I asked.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael continued, \"...the paramedics were great. They kept telling&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; me I   was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ERand&lt;&lt;   I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; really scared. In their eyes, I read \"he's a dead man. I knew I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; needed to take action.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"What did you do?\" I asked.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me,\" said&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"She asked if I was allergic to anything. \"Yes, I replied.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I took a deep breath and yelled, \"Gravity.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Over their laughter, I told them, \"I am choosing to live. Operateon&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; me as if I am alive, not dead.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; the choice to live fully.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Attitude, after all, is everything.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; You have two choices now:&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; 1.   Delete this.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; 2.   Forward it to the people you care about.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I hope you will choose #2.   I did.\n"

He is always in a good&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; mood and always has something positive to say:&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, \"if I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; were any better, I would be twins!\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; He was a natural motivator.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; If an employee was having a bad day, Michael was there telling the&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael and asked him, \"I don't get it! You can't be a positive&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; person all of the time. How do you do it?\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael replied, \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself, youhave&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; two choices today.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in abad&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; mood.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I choose to be in a good mood.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; can choose to learn from it.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I choose to learn from it.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I choose the positive side of life.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Yeah, right, it's not that easy,\"   I protested.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Yes, it is,\"   Michael said.   \"Life is all about choices. When you&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; You choose how you react to situations. You choose how peopleaffect&lt;&lt;   &lt;your&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; mood.   You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; The bottom line:   It's your choice how you live life.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I reflected on what Michael said. Soon thereafter, I left the&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; company to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of&lt;&lt;   reacting to&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; it.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved in a serious&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications tower.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Michael was&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; released from the hospital with rods placed in his back.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I saw Michael about six months after the accident.   When I askedhim&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; how he was, he replied. \"If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; see my scars?\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what had gone&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; through his mind as the accident took place.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"The first thing that went through my mind was the well-being of my&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; soon to be born daughter,\" Michael replied. \"Then, as I lay on the&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; ground, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; or I could choose to die. I chose to live.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?\" I asked.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael continued, \"...the paramedics were great. They kept telling&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; me I   was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the ERand&lt;&lt;   I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; really scared. In their eyes, I read \"he's a dead man. I knew I&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; needed to take action.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"What did you do?\" I asked.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Well there was a big burly nurse shouting questions at me,\" said&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"She asked if I was allergic to anything. \"Yes, I replied.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I took a deep breath and yelled, \"Gravity.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Over their laughter, I told them, \"I am choosing to live. Operateon&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; me as if I am alive, not dead.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Michael lived, thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; the choice to live fully.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; Attitude, after all, is everything.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; \"Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.\"&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; After all today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; You have two choices now:&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; 1.   Delete this.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; 2.   Forward it to the people you care about.&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt; I hope you will choose #2.   I did.\n"

Especially #10Blowjob Etiquette For Men, From Women:&lt; &lt;   1. First and foremost, we are not obligated to do it.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   2. Extension to rule #1 - So if you get one, be grateful.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   3. I don't care WHAT they did in the porn video you&lt; &lt;   saw, it is not standard practice to cum on someone's&lt; &lt;   face.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   4. Extension to rule #3 - No, I DON'T have to swallow.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   5. My ears are NOT handles.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   6. Extension to rule #5 - do not push on the top of&lt; &lt;   my head. Last I heard, deep throat had been done. And&lt; &lt;   additionally, do you really WANT puke on your dick?&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   7. I don't care HOW relaxed you get, it is NEVER OK&lt; &lt;   to fart.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   8. Having my period does not mean that it's \"hummer&lt; &lt;   week\" - get it through your head - I'm bloated and I&lt; &lt;   feel like shit so no, I don't feel particularly obligated&lt; &lt;   to blow you just because YOU can't have sex right now.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   9. Extension to #8 - \"Blue Balls\" might have worked&lt; &lt;   on high school girls - if you're that desperate, go&lt; &lt;   jerk off and leave me alone with my Midol.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   10. If I have to pause to remove a pubic hair from my&lt; &lt;   teeth, don't tell me I've just \"wrecked it\" for you.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   111. Leaving me in bed while you go play video games&lt; &lt;   immediately afterwards is highly inadvisable if you&lt; &lt;   would like my behavior to be repeated in the future.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   12. If you like how we do it, it's probably best not&lt; &lt;   to speculate about the origins of our talent. Just enjoy&lt; &lt;   the moment and be happy that we're good at it. See also&lt; &lt;   rule #2 about gratitude.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   13. No, it doesn't particularly taste good. And I don't&lt; &lt;   care about the protein content.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   14. No, I will NOT do it while you watch TV.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;   15. When you hear your friends complain about how they&lt; &lt;   don't get blowjobs often enough, keep your mouth shut.&lt; &lt;   It is inappropriate to either sympathize or brag.\n"

Johnson's   pitch to the Giants' Calvin Murray was about three-fourths of the way to home   plate when it struck the bird. Giants second baseman Jeff Kent picked   up the dead bird with his bare hands and jokingly pointed toward Johnson   before taking it to the dugout. Johnson was not amused by the incident. \"I   didn't think it was all that funny,\" he said. On Aug. 4, 1983, Yankees   outfielder Dave Winfield killed a seagull in Toronto with a warmup throw. The   Ontario police charged him with animal cruelty, although the charge was later   dropped.

Cleveland Steamer: an act in which one partner hovers above the&lt; other, and shits on his/her chest.&lt;&lt; 2. Tossing Salad: eating out a man or woman's ass. The term was used in&lt; a segment of an HBO prison documentary.&lt;&lt; 3. Rusty Trombone: the process by which one person is tossing a guy's&lt; salad, and then reaches around and gives them a hand job.&lt;&lt; 4. Dirty Sanchez: while fucking a girl doggy style, insert a finger in&lt; her ass and get it all shitty. Then, reach around to her face and give&lt; her a shit moustache, a \"shitstache\" if you will.&lt;&lt; 5. Slimy Snatchita: it's basically the same concept as the Dirty&lt; Sanchez. Instead of shit, get your finger all bloody and she won't know&lt; anything is wrong until the morning when she awakes with a crusty&lt; dry-blood moustache.&lt;&lt; 6. Dirty Schultz: same as Dirty Sanchez, except you give yourself the&lt; shitstache.&lt;&lt; 7. Dog In a Bathtub: when a man attempts to insert his nuts into a girls&lt; ass (why anyone would WANT to do this is mind-boggling).   Apparently,&lt; it's about as difficult to keep them there as it is to keep a dog in a&lt; bathtub.&lt;&lt; 8. Samoan Pile Driver: a sexual position that occurs when a woman's&lt; back and the bed are perpendicular, but she is upside down. The man&lt; stands above the woman and points his gig due south, simply bending his&lt; knees for repeated stroking.&lt;&lt; 9. Whale's eye: a Woman's privates.   Ever see the eyes on a blue whale,&lt; humpback whale, sperm whale, killer whale, etc? If not, check out an&lt; issue of National Geographic.&lt;&lt; 10. Balloon Knot: the Backdoor. The anus. The poop-chute.   The \"fudge&lt; factory\", if you will. You know, the asshole.&lt;&lt; 111. Coney Island Whitefish: a used condom, usually found floating in the&lt; water.&lt;&lt; 12. New Jersey Meathook: when a man inserts his finger in the ass of his&lt; partner while screwing her, and feeling her cervix. Most effective from&lt; behind.&lt;&lt; 13. Boston Shocker: when a man sticks his penis in the woman's anus and&lt; then puts it in her mouth then back to her ass.&lt;&lt; 14. Snowballing: when a man comes in a girl*s mouth then she spits it&lt; back into his mouth or it can be into another girls mouth.&lt;&lt; 15. Teabagging: when a man stands above the woman then dips his balls in&lt; her mouth.&lt;&lt; 16. Fanny Batter: in Britain they call a woman's vagina   the FANNY and&lt; of course all the beautiful homemade lubricant is the BATTER.   It always&lt; gets the Limeys rolling, when ordering fish &amp; chips, if you ask for the&lt; haddock with EXTRA fanny batter.&lt;&lt; 17. Brushback Pitch: when you're getting head, yell \"Batter Up!\" Then,&lt; quickly pull out and give her a dick in the ear.&lt;&lt; 18. Cropduster: when spooning with your woman, and you are in front with&lt; your back to her front, if a fart accidentally sneaks out into her bush,&lt; it's called crop-dusting.&lt;&lt; 19. Dutch Oven: entrapping an unsuspecting sleeping partner in a world&lt; of ass odor by farting under the covers and pulling them over her head&lt; (and yours as well if you're into that sort of thing).&lt;&lt; 20. Dutch Treat: the unexpected result of a Dutch Oven gone terribly&lt; wrong. Very messy indeed.&lt;&lt; 21. Fountain of Youth: while sitting on her face and having her eat your&lt; ass, jerk off like a madman.&lt;&lt; 222. Tupperware Party: when three guys are triple-teaming a chick: one&lt; with his penis in her mouth, another in her vagina, and the third in her&lt; anus. So named because he is air-tight.&lt;&lt; 23. Arabian Goggles: a seldom-seen maneuver involving the testicles&lt; where the satchel is spread wide and placed on the face of the \"ride\",&lt; thus resting the balls in the gogglee's eye sockets.&lt;&lt; 24. Beef Curtain: The shanked out remains of the labia after being&lt; stretched like Play-doh from an hour or so of jimmy-jam (a.k.a. Beef&lt; Drapes, Meat Tarp, Piss Flappers, Quim Nuts, Vertical Bacon Sandwich)&lt;&lt;&lt; Letter to the editor,&lt; I've heard stories from various people about foods and liquids that can&lt; affect the taste of semen, some of them with reasons, others without.&lt; One no-no, is beer.   Beer apparently causes semen to have a bad taste.&lt; On the plus side though, pineapple juice (while not only tasting good)&lt; makes semen taste sweet.   Also, 'fake' sugar like NutraSweet and Equal,&lt; and the sweeteners found in drinks like diet coke, apparently pass&lt; through the body unprocessed, and will come out of the body in their&lt; original form.   This can make semen have a sweet taste also.&lt;&lt; \n"

Enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in new markets.   Is Enron going to be just a trading company?2.)   If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite volatile.   How could this affect our stock price?   Will Wall Street be prepared to accept more volatile earnings?3.)   Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and new platforms are being introduced into the market place.   Is this going to have a negative effect on Enron's stock price?4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near future?5.)   Is Broadband coming along as quickly as Wall St. expects and how much of our stock price is based on broadband?I hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to discuss and I look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow.Sincerely,Matt Lenhart\n"

Barbie is, without a&lt; &lt;&lt;doubt,&lt; &lt;&lt;the world's most famous doll, and over the last 40 years, there havebeen&lt; &lt;&lt;literally hundreds of available versions of this blonde bombshell.   From&lt; &lt;&lt;Glitter Beach Barbiec and Shopping Spree Barbiec to Pilgrim Barbiec and&lt; &lt;&lt;Country Bride Blonde Barbiec, you probably thought you'd seen them all.&lt; &lt;&lt;Well,&lt; &lt;&lt;boy, were you wrong!   With the new millennium fast approaching, Barbie's&lt; &lt;&lt;here&lt; &lt;&lt;to prove yet again that she's very capable at keeping pace with these&lt; &lt;&lt;ever-changing times.   Below are ten brand new Barbie dolls that are&lt; &lt;&lt;currently&lt; &lt;&lt;under development.   Download the attached. JPEG file to sneak a peek at&lt; &lt;&lt;what&lt; &lt;&lt;the folks at Mattel Toys have in store for you (BADGIRLBARBIE.JPG).&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;BAYOU BONDAGE BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Barbie just loves the beach!   Unfortunately, Ken took a wrong turn off&lt; &lt;&lt;I-555&lt; &lt;&lt;near New Orleans, and our copulating couple got lost. Now, Barbie is ina&lt; &lt;&lt;bit&lt; &lt;&lt;of a \"bind.\" Will she free herself in time for Spring BreakShenanigansc,&lt; &lt;&lt;or&lt; &lt;&lt;will she join Ken in an alligator's large intestine? Only you candecide!&lt; &lt;&lt;Inbred Raging' Cajunc not included.)&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;SORORITY SLUT BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Barbie loves keg parties. And she inherently trusts her boyfriend of 4&lt; &lt;&lt;months, Kappa Kappa Kenc. Those two facts spell certain social disaster&lt; &lt;&lt;for&lt; &lt;&lt;Sorority Slut Barbiec. She even comes with her very own funnel!   Kappa&lt; &lt;&lt;Kappa&lt; &lt;&lt;Voyeur Video Recording Roomc play set sold separately.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;GOTH BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;She's all the \"rave!\"   Goth Barbie likes lurking around in urbandungeons,&lt; &lt;&lt;inhaling whip-its, and asking complete strangers to pierce her genitalia&lt; &lt;&lt;(although she's not particularly crazy about sunlight or personal&lt; &lt;&lt;hygiene).&lt; &lt;&lt;Glitter Great Sarcophagusc sold separately.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;EXOTIC DANCE BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Some girls will do anything for a buck. But not Exotic Dancer Barbie!Her&lt; &lt;&lt;two-minute lap dances cost 20 smackers, and that's without any touching&lt; &lt;&lt;whatsoever!   How many dollars will it cost Middle Management Kenc to&lt; &lt;&lt;figure&lt; &lt;&lt;that out? You decide!   (Greased Polec included, if you know what Imean.)&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;TRANSGENDER BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Fortunately, today's Barbie isn't confined by silly and archaic notions&lt; &lt;&lt;such&lt; &lt;&lt;as \"gender identity.\"   Introducing Kendrac, the only Barbie able to&lt; &lt;&lt;clearly&lt; &lt;&lt;see beyond stereotypical gender lines. Whether you're in the mood for&lt; &lt;&lt;club-hopping or feel-copping, count Kendrac out (of the closet, thatis)!&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;GANGSTA BITCH BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Gangsta Bitch Barbie doesn't mind if you manufacture crank in herhouse ---&lt; &lt;&lt;but don't talk to Compton Kenc, or she just might plug a cap in yourass!&lt; &lt;&lt;Extra rounds not included. Drive-by Death Dodgec sold separately.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;PARANOID BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Authentic alien abductee, or just another raving lunatic wrapped in&lt; &lt;&lt;aluminum&lt; &lt;&lt;foil? Only you can decide whether Paranoid Barbie is down-to-Earth or&lt; &lt;&lt;out-to-lunch. (Rectal probec included upon request.)&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;BABY GOT BACK BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Barbie knows that the bigger the cushion, the sweeter the pushin, andwith&lt; &lt;&lt;Ken ever eager to bring up the proverbial rear, this Barbie's caboose is&lt; &lt;&lt;certainly loose (not to mention gigantic!). Move over ladies, if youcan!&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;FEMI-NAZI BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;Sometimes Barbie just gets sick and tired of Ken's shit. Backed with a&lt; &lt;&lt;little&lt; &lt;&lt;bit of bitterness, a bunch of overweight short-haired friends, and awhole&lt; &lt;&lt;lot of Ken-Kickin' Groin Buster Actionc, Femi-Nazi Barbie is marching&lt; &lt;&lt;toward&lt; &lt;&lt;some gender justice. Watch out, Ken --- it's that time of the month!&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;LACTATING BARBIEc&lt; &lt;&lt;What could be more natural than a mother and her newborn baby?

A must read.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Read Alone and Read it All&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;   CASE 1: Kelly Sedey had one wish, for her boyfriend of three years,&lt; &lt;David&lt; &lt; &lt; Marsden, to propose to her.&lt; &lt; &lt; Then one day when she was out to lunch, David proposed! She accepted.&lt; &lt;But&lt; &lt; &lt; she then had to leave because she had&lt; &lt; &lt; a meeting in 20 min. When she got back to her office she noticed onher&lt; &lt; &lt; computer she had e-mail. She checked it, the usual&lt; &lt; &lt; stuff from friends, but then she saw one that she had never seenbefore.&lt; &lt;It&lt; &lt; &lt; was this very letter. She simply deleted it, without reading it. BIG&lt; &lt; &lt; MISTAKE!!! Later that evening she received a call from the local police&lt; &lt;It&lt; &lt; &lt; was regarding David. He had been in an accident with an 18-wheeler, he&lt; &lt; &lt; didn't not survive.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; CASE 2: Take Katie Robbenson. She received this letter and being the&lt; &lt; &lt; believer that she was sent&lt; &lt; &lt; it off to a few of her friends, but did not have enough to send to the&lt; &lt;full&lt; &lt; &lt; 10 that you must.   Three days later she went to a Masquerade   Ball.&lt; &lt;Later&lt; &lt; &lt; that night when she left to get to her car to go home, she was killedon&lt; &lt; &lt; the&lt; &lt; &lt; spot by a hit-run drunk&lt; &lt; &lt; driver.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; CASE 3: Richard S. Willis sent this letter out within 45 minutes of&lt; &lt;reading&lt; &lt; &lt; it. Not even 4 hours later walking along the street   to his new job&lt; &lt; &lt; interview, with a really big company, when he ran into Cynthia Bell,his&lt; &lt; &lt; secret love of 5 years.   Cynthia came up to him and told him of her&lt; &lt; &lt; passionate crush on him that she had for 2 years.   Three days later he&lt; &lt; &lt; proposed to her and they were married. They are still married to this&lt; &lt;day&lt; &lt; &lt; and have three children.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; This is the letter:&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Around the corner I have a friend, In this great city that has no end,&lt; &lt;Yet&lt; &lt; &lt; the days go by, and the weeks rush on,&lt; &lt; &lt; And before I know it a year has gone.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; And I never see my old friends face, For life is a swift and terrible&lt; &lt;race,&lt; &lt; &lt; He knows I like him just as well,&lt; &lt; &lt; As in the days when I rang his bell, And he rang mine if, we were&lt; &lt;younger&lt; &lt; &lt; then, And now we are&lt; &lt; &lt; busy, tired men.   Tired of playing a foolish game, Tired of trying to&lt; &lt;make&lt; &lt; &lt; a&lt; &lt; &lt; name.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; \"Tomorrow\" I say. \"I will call on Jim\"&lt; &lt; &lt; \"Just to show I am thinking of him\"&lt; &lt; &lt; But tomorrow comes and tomorrow goes,&lt; &lt; &lt; And distance between us grows and grows.&lt; &lt; &lt; Around the corner!-yet miles away,&lt; &lt; &lt; \"Here's a telegram sir\" \"Jim died today\"&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; And that's what we get and deserve in the end.&lt; &lt; &lt; Around the corner, a vanished friend.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Remember to always say what you mean.&lt; &lt; &lt; If you love someone - tell them.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Don't be afraid to express yourself.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Reach out and tell someone what they mean to you,&lt; &lt; &lt; because when you decide that it is the right time, it might be toolate.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; Seize the day, Never have regrets.&lt; &lt; &lt; Most importantly stay close to your friends and family, for they have&lt; &lt; &lt; helped&lt; &lt; &lt; make you&lt; &lt; &lt; the person you are today.&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; You must send this on within 3 hours, after reading the letter, to 10&lt; &lt; &lt; different people.

Women wear high heels to bed. &lt;&lt;2.? Men are never impotent. &lt;&lt;3.? When going down on a woman 10 seconds is more than satisfactory. &lt;&lt;4.? If a woman gets busted masturbating by a strange man, she will not &lt;&lt;??? scream with embarrassment, but rather insist he have sex with her. &lt;&lt;5.Women smile appreciatively when men splat them in the face with sperm. &lt;&lt;6.? Women enjoy having sex with ugly, middle-aged men. &lt;&lt;7.? Women moan uncontrollably when giving a blowjob. &lt;&lt;8.? Women always orgasm when men do. &lt;&lt;9.? A blowjob will always get a woman off a speeding ticket. &lt;&lt;10. All women are noisy fucks. &lt;&lt;111. People in the 70's couldn't fuck unless there was a wild guitar solo &lt;&lt;??? in the background. &lt;&lt;12. Those tits are real. &lt;&lt;13. A common and enjoyable sexual practice for a man is to take his &lt;&lt;??? half-erect penis and slap it repeatedly on a woman's butt. &lt;&lt;14. Men always groan \"OH YEAH!\" when they cum. &lt;&lt;15. If there is two of them they \"high five\" each other.(and the girl &lt;&lt;??? isn't disgusted!) &lt;&lt;16. Double penetration makes women smile. &lt;&lt;17. Asian men don't exist. &lt;&lt;18. If you come across a guy and his girlfriend having sex in the &lt;&lt;??? bushes, the boyfriend won't bash seven shades of shit out of you &lt;&lt;??? if you shove your cock in his girlfriend's mouth. &lt;&lt;19. There's a plot. &lt;&lt;20. When taking a woman from behind, a man can really excite a woman by &lt;&lt;??? giving her a gentle slap on the butt. &lt;&lt;21. Nurses suck patient's cocks. &lt;&lt;222. Men always pull out. &lt;&lt;23. When your girlfriend busts you getting head from her best friend, &lt;&lt;??? she'll only be momentarily pissed off before fucking the both of &lt;&lt;??? you. &lt;&lt;24. Women never have headaches... or periods. &lt;&lt;25. When a woman is sucking a man's cock, it's important for him to &lt;&lt;??? remind her to \"suck it\". &lt;&lt;26. Assholes are clean. &lt;&lt;27. A man ejaculating on a woman's butt is a satisfying result for all &lt;&lt;??? parties concerned. &lt;&lt;28. Women always look pleasantly surprised when they open a man's &lt;&lt;??? trousers and find a cock there. &lt;&lt;29. Men don't have to beg. &lt;&lt;30. When standing during a blowjob, a man will always place one hand &lt;&lt;??? firmly on the back of the kneeling woman's head and the other &lt;&lt;??? proudly on his hip &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; ___ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:///explorer.msn.com \n"

Women wear high heels to bed. &lt;&lt;2.? Men are never impotent. &lt;&lt;3.? When going down on a woman 10 seconds is more than satisfactory. &lt;&lt;4.? If a woman gets busted masturbating by a strange man, she will not &lt;&lt;??? scream with embarrassment, but rather insist he have sex with her. &lt;&lt;5.Women smile appreciatively when men splat them in the face with sperm. &lt;&lt;6.? Women enjoy having sex with ugly, middle-aged men. &lt;&lt;7.? Women moan uncontrollably when giving a blowjob. &lt;&lt;8.? Women always orgasm when men do. &lt;&lt;9.? A blowjob will always get a woman off a speeding ticket. &lt;&lt;10. All women are noisy fucks. &lt;&lt;111. People in the 70's couldn't fuck unless there was a wild guitar solo &lt;&lt;??? in the background. &lt;&lt;12. Those tits are real. &lt;&lt;13. A common and enjoyable sexual practice for a man is to take his &lt;&lt;??? half-erect penis and slap it repeatedly on a woman's butt. &lt;&lt;14. Men always groan \"OH YEAH!\" when they cum. &lt;&lt;15. If there is two of them they \"high five\" each other.(and the girl &lt;&lt;??? isn't disgusted!) &lt;&lt;16. Double penetration makes women smile. &lt;&lt;17. Asian men don't exist. &lt;&lt;18. If you come across a guy and his girlfriend having sex in the &lt;&lt;??? bushes, the boyfriend won't bash seven shades of shit out of you &lt;&lt;??? if you shove your cock in his girlfriend's mouth. &lt;&lt;19. There's a plot. &lt;&lt;20. When taking a woman from behind, a man can really excite a woman by &lt;&lt;??? giving her a gentle slap on the butt. &lt;&lt;21. Nurses suck patient's cocks. &lt;&lt;222. Men always pull out. &lt;&lt;23. When your girlfriend busts you getting head from her best friend, &lt;&lt;??? she'll only be momentarily pissed off before fucking the both of &lt;&lt;??? you. &lt;&lt;24. Women never have headaches... or periods. &lt;&lt;25. When a woman is sucking a man's cock, it's important for him to &lt;&lt;??? remind her to \"suck it\". &lt;&lt;26. Assholes are clean. &lt;&lt;27. A man ejaculating on a woman's butt is a satisfying result for all &lt;&lt;??? parties concerned. &lt;&lt;28. Women always look pleasantly surprised when they open a man's &lt;&lt;??? trousers and find a cock there. &lt;&lt;29. Men don't have to beg. &lt;&lt;30. When standing during a blowjob, a man will always place one hand &lt;&lt;??? firmly on the back of the kneeling woman's head and the other &lt;&lt;??? proudly on his hip &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; ___ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http:///explorer.msn.com \n"

They are proud   of their football heritage, their schools, and their teams. And they share a   deep pride that goes with being from the south\" ---George Mooney, the   irreplaceable \"Voice of the Volunteers\" in the 1950s   \"The true football fan pays no attention to time or mileage when there is a   big game to see.\" ---John Heisman, head coach, Auburn University   \"In Baton Rouge, the focal point of everything is Tiger football.\" ---Jim   Corbett   \"In Baton Rouge, it's not a law to love LSU, but the city fathers could   probably get one passed if they needed to.\" ---Charles McClendon, head   coach, LSU   \"After so many years at a school, you become a member of the football   family.\" ---Bob Fulton   \"I don't care where a man comes from or how he spells his name. All I   ask is that he be loyal to Georgia, proud of that jersey, and try like the   devil to win.\" ---Wally Butts, head coach, Georgia   \"Deep inside, we're still the boys of autumn, that magic time of the year   that once swept us on to America's fields.\" ---Archie Manning   \"Tradition is a rich asset for any team. Tradition and success are traveling   companions.\" ---Wallace Wade, head coach, University of Alabama   The above quotes were excerpted from Criswell Freeman's \"The   Wisdom of Southern Football\" (19995).   As football season creeps ever closer, the avid enthusiast finds it difficult   to contain the unbridled excitement and anticipation that bubbles like   summertime sweat within their pigskin-thirsty souls. Football season is   that special time of year that not only means the beginning of another   healthy slate of competitive gridiron contests filled with spectacular plays   and high drama---it's also the definitive rallying point for the onslaught of   all the expected pomp, pageantry, and circumstance that goes   hand-in-hand with the college game. In no conference in the country is   this statement more true than the tradition-rich Southeastern Conference.   The ongoing rivalries, the colorful histories and traditions, the premier   tailgating, the coquettish southern bells in their gameday garb, the reunion   of lasting friendships, and the competitive fire and spirit that accompany   the game, all make the entire SEC football experience a very real, and   visceral one---even to the most casual observer.   The Southeastern Conference is unequivocally the paragon of the college   football conferences, and the 2000 season figures not to disappoint the   thousands of rabid fans that flock to the stadiums each week throughout   the southeast; as well as the millions more who tune in from home on the   tube to follow their respective teams. Quite frankly, SEC football has   never been bigger, or better. The southern cultural phenomenon only   continues to grow with each passing season. The number of fans, and the   competition that they long for each and every weekend of the football   season, has never been bigger or better. In 1999, the SEC again set   attendance records for its games, and with the many recent expansions to   existing stadiums in the conference, those records should again fall at the   end of this season.   Five Reasons Tiger Fans Can Be Excited About the 2000 Football   Season   1. Lou Tepper is no longer in Tiger Town.   Heralded by professional defensive coaches as a \"guru\" and a \"defensive   genius\" prior to his arrival at LSU, the former Illinois head coach led the   LSU defense to its worst two-year performance in the history of the   school (1893). If you are interested in immortalizing the Tepper legacy at   LSU for your scrapbook, copies of his book \"Complete Linebacking\"   can still be obtained (at a discounted price no less) at most local book   outlets. In Tepper's absence, maybe the Tigers will return to the days of   coach Charlie Mac and the standout defensive units that were his   trademark while at the Ole War Skule. Speaking of Coach Mac, I caught   up with him last week at his home and he sounded as spry as a spring   chicken. He told me that he is doing great and that he enjoys cycling in   the mornings to stay in shape. Coach told me that he hopes that the LSU   players have fun this year, because, he said, \"...having fun is what it's all   about. If you can't have any fun, you're in big trouble.\"   2. Contrary to popular belief, the Tigers are deep at quarterback.   Preseason prognosticators have cited the injury to Rohan Davey as a   core reason why the Tigers will have trouble at the quarterback position.   They all opined early that both Booty and Nall had difficulties leading the   offense and that the injury to Davey was a major setback to the Tiger   offense. However, reports from summer camp indicate that Rohan is now   within 95-1000 percent of his normal range of motion on his knee, and in   light of this it would appear that the Tigers are again three-deep at the   quarterback position. The resurgence of Rohan is a tremendous boost to   the team. Known for his leadership ability both on and off the field,   Rohan possesses the true grit that wins ball games. I caught up with   former LSU All-American and coach Gaynell Tinsley at his Highland   Road home a few weeks ago, and he told me that he thought that   Rohan's performance against Arkansas was the best he had ever seen by   an LSU quarterback. True frosh Marcus Randall impressed in the LA   High School All-Star game last week, but he is a likely redshirt with the   logjam of experienced competition ahead of him.   3. Nick Saban.   Derided unfairly early by most SEC media outlets as being \"incompatible\"   with Louisianians' unique culture and high football expectations, Saban is   easily the best thing to happen to LSU football since Kevin Faulk. A   consummate professional, Saban exudes confidence and paints a clear   vision for the future of the program. His presence in Red Stick has made   an immediate impact on the program, evidenced by the recent glowing   comments at media days by seniors Louis William and Fred Booker.   Saban was also unfairly chastised heavily by the media for his inability to   bring any assistants with him to LSU from his previous staff at Michigan   State. However, Coach Saban recently aptly stated at the SEC media   days that only a couple of his previous staff members had ever been   \"south of the Mason-Dixon line.\" That notwithstanding, you cannot argue   with the fact that Saban has compiled a great staff of southern coaches.   Tiger fans should find further solace in the fact that coach Saban has   never had a losing record as a football coach.   4. Trev Faulk &amp; Bradie James at Linebacker.   All good defenses have a common trait---great linebacking play, and you'll   be hard-pressed to find two better young horses than these two. Outside   linebacker and pass rushing specialist Jeremy Lawrence is another super   sophomore to keep your eyes on. These guys all have good wheels, and   will put the leather on you when they get the chance. James' number 111   Faulk's recent acquisition of Mealey's lucky 7 will undoubtedly prompt   many fans and commentators to make countless puns and jokes related   to LSU's 7-111 linebacking duo.   5. Predictions Don't Mean Diddly   The other day I was scouring through the many rolls of microfilm in the   basement of Middleton Library at LSU, and I stumbled upon this most   interesting fact:   In August, 1958, LSU was picked to finish 8th out of 10 SEC teams.   Auburn, which had won the national championship the year prior with   Shug Jordan, was picked to repeat as conference champs, followed by   Ole Miss and Mississippi State.   Of course, in spite of the dismal preseason ranking by the SEC   sportswriters, the Bengal Tigers went on to record their only unblemished   season and national college football championship to date. This story   should only serve to encourage fans that are despondent over the   outcome of the past two seasons in Tigertown. Anything can happen in   the SEC, and remember, the old adage says that \"history repeats itself.\"   Keep the faith Tigerfans!   Until next time...\n"

The firm sales amount of which you did notperform was   5000 mmbtu at $6.90.   Gas daily reported that the weekendtraded as low as $3.70.   Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages inthe amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.   Iwould like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose isnot the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firmas are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose andAlberta Energy Company.   We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this aserious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in theCalifornia market place and are treating it as such.   Our companies have hada longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we canregain trading together in the future.

WE NEED MORE   HOWEVER!!!? Don't forget to spread the word if anyone you know would be   interested.? I surely expect atleast 10 more to join but would love alot   more.? Anyway, now to the important stuff...getting on the   site.?Unlike in years past, I feel that people are more   internet literate and can get signed up in a league without step by step   instructions.? So I am going to give you the basics and you can figure it   out from there.? I advise you do it sooner than later incase you have any   problems.?The site is ww.commissioner.com.? On the home   page, you will see the?a place to sign into commissioner.? You must   have an account with commission.com to join the league.? It is the same   site we used last year and your name and password should still be active.?   If you don't remember it, you can create a new one or there is probably   somewhere that you can get them to email you your?username and   password.? Anyway, once you set up an account scroll down and select Office   Pool Manager. Our league name is Losers Wanted.? We also have a short name   of Loser (they might ask for that also, ***notice no 's').? The password is   333.?You should be taken to a page to pick who you   are.? Your name should not be in the list.? Select \"new player\" and   enter your name.? This should take you to the site.?Once you are in...BOOKMARK IT.? It will make   it alot easier to get to it in the future.? Take a look at the site.?   The three main links you will be using are...1)Make Picks...2)My   Picks...3)Standings.? Each week (I think Tuesday) commissioner.com will   enter the lines on the Make Picks page.? These lines will stay constant   untill they close the entries for the week (1 hour before first kick?off,   includes Thursday games).? You can make your picks and change your picks on   this page.? To view your picks you can go to My Picks.? On Monday you   can check the Standings.? You can view it by a certain week or the yearly   totals.? Just click on the top on what column you will want to sort   by.? That is basically it.?There are other links if you want to check   them out...it is a great site.?As for the rules...the money will all be determined   as I get an exact number of players...ALL MONEY WILL BE PAID OUT!!! There will   be weekly winners and yearly winners (and LOSER).? The picks you make each   week will be each game that week, including Monday nights game.? In   addition to Monday's game, you will pick the Monday night total points   scored.? This tie breaker will determine weekly winners in case of any   ties.? The person closest to the total will win the tie breaker (absolute   value).? If the absolute value is equal, the under will beat the   over.? Example...total points is 30.? Player A picks 35...B picks   20...A wins.? Player A pick 35...B picks 25...B wins.? Don't worry, it   is real easy.? ?As for the tie breaker for the season totals.?   Anyone that is tied at the top will use the playoffs in the NFL as our   playoffs.? I will send out the lines (the site won't have them) to the   players involved.? You will pick all four games and the person who gets the   most correct will win.? If multiple people tie then we will weed out and go   on to the next weeks.? If it makes it all the way to the superbowl, then we   will pick the game and an over/under as the ultimate tiebreaker.?Don't worry if you don't make your picks one   week.? You won't take a zero?( I am a softie).? Too many people   have those weeks that they can't get around to making there picks.? If I   gave zeros, that would kill your chances for the yearly total.? Anyone that   doesn't get their picks in will take all the AWAY teams.? I will enter   those picks after the deadline to enter picks.? All these games will count   to the yearly total but can not win the weekly prize.? ?That is it for now...Oh ya, one more thing.?   You can send me a check ($50) to the following.? ?Michael Brookner30001 Hillcroft #508Houston, TX 777057???PLEASE DON'T FORWARD THIS TO NEW   PLAYERS.???I WANT TO KNOW EVERYONE THAT IS IN.? IF YOU KNOW   SOMEONE THAT IS INTERESTED, HAVE THEM EMAIL ME AT BROOK@PDQ.NET.? I WILL SEND ALL THIS INFO   TO THEM WHEN I GET THERE INTEREST.???THANKS...Brook\n"

You are not my son.\"\"\"I don't think you understand, Mother!\" the young man pleads.\"I just won the greatest sporting event in the world.I'm here among thousands of my adoring fans.\"\"\"No, let me tell you,\" the mother retorts.\"At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us.The neighborhood is a pile of rubble.Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives yesterday,and today your sister was kidnapped in broad daylight.\"The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says \" ...I'll never forgive you for making us move toNew Orleans.\"\n"

We've all kicked&lt; &lt;&lt; back in&lt; &lt;&lt; our cubicles and suddenly felt something a brew down below.   As much&lt; &lt;&lt; as we&lt; &lt;&lt; try to convince ourselves, the WORK POOP is inevitable.   For those of&lt; &lt;&lt; you&lt; &lt;&lt; who hate pooping at work as much as I do, I give you the...&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; 1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK.&lt; &lt;&lt; Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure&lt; &lt;&lt; pleasure.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; ESCAPEE&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or&lt; &lt;&lt; forcing poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave&lt; &lt;&lt; of&lt; &lt;&lt; panic/embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when&lt; &lt;&lt; passing an unseen police car and speeding.   If you release an escapee,&lt; &lt;&lt; do&lt; &lt;&lt; not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.   If you are standing&lt; &lt;&lt; next to&lt; &lt;&lt; the farter at the urinal, pretend that you did not hear it.   No one&lt; &lt;&lt; likes an&lt; &lt;&lt; escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved.   Making a joke or&lt; &lt;&lt; laughing&lt; &lt;&lt; makes both parties feel uneasy.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) Definition: When forcing&lt; &lt;&lt; poop,&lt; &lt;&lt; several farts slip out at a machine guns pace. This is usually a side&lt; &lt;&lt; effect&lt; &lt;&lt; of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen do not panic, remain&lt; &lt;&lt; in the&lt; &lt;&lt; stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the&lt; &lt;&lt; awkwardness of what just occurred.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; COURTESY FLUSH&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone&lt; &lt;&lt; of the&lt; &lt;&lt; poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed&lt; &lt;&lt; location.   This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink&lt; &lt;&lt; up the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom.   This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF&lt; &lt;&lt; SHAME.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; WALK OF SHAME&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you&lt; &lt;&lt; have&lt; &lt;&lt; just stunk-up the bathroom.   This can be a very uncomfortable moment&lt; &lt;&lt; if&lt; &lt;&lt; someone walks in.   As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the&lt; &lt;&lt; smell&lt; &lt;&lt; does not exist.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it.&lt; &lt;&lt; You will&lt; &lt;&lt; often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a&lt; &lt;&lt; newspaper or&lt; &lt;&lt; magazine under their arm.   Always look around the office for the Out&lt; &lt;&lt; of the&lt; &lt;&lt; Closet pooper before entering the bathroom.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A group of coworkers who band together to ensure&lt; &lt;&lt; \"emergency&lt; &lt;&lt; pooping\" goes off without incident.   This group can help you to&lt; &lt;&lt; monitor the&lt; &lt;&lt; whereabouts of OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; SAFE HAVEN&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where&lt; &lt;&lt; you can&lt; &lt;&lt; least expect visitors.   Try floors that are predominantly of the&lt; &lt;&lt; opposite&lt; &lt;&lt; sex.   This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; TURD BURGLAR&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall&lt; &lt;&lt; and&lt; &lt;&lt; tries to force the door open.   This is one of the most shocking and&lt; &lt;&lt; vulnerable moments that occur when work taking a dump at work.   If&lt; &lt;&lt; this&lt; &lt;&lt; occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD BURG leaves. This way you&lt; &lt;&lt; will&lt; &lt;&lt; avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; CAMO-COUGH&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom&lt; &lt;&lt; that you are in a stall.   This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or&lt; &lt;&lt; to&lt; &lt;&lt; alert potential TURD BURGLARS.   Very effective when used in&lt; &lt;&lt; conjunction with&lt; &lt;&lt; an ASTAIRE.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; ASTAIRE&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential TURD&lt; &lt;&lt; BURGLARS&lt; &lt;&lt; that you are occupying a stall.   This will remove all doubt that the&lt; &lt;&lt; stall&lt; &lt;&lt; is occupied.   If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the bathroom immediately&lt; &lt;&lt; so the&lt; &lt;&lt; pooper can poop in peace.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; WATERMELON&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet&lt; &lt;&lt; water.&lt; &lt;&lt; This is also an embarrassing incident.   If you feel a WATERMELON&lt; &lt;&lt; coming on,&lt; &lt;&lt; create a diversion.   See CAMO-COUGH.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; HAVANA OMELET&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes&lt; &lt;&lt; in&lt; &lt;&lt; the toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee.   Try using a&lt; &lt;&lt; CAMO-COUGH&lt; &lt;&lt; with an ASTAIRE.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; UNCLE TED&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever.&lt; &lt;&lt; Could&lt; &lt;&lt; spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on&lt; &lt;&lt; the pot.&lt; &lt;&lt; An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you&lt; &lt;&lt; should&lt; &lt;&lt; always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This&lt; &lt;&lt; benefits you&lt; &lt;&lt; as well as the other bathroom attendees.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; FLY BY&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.   Walk&lt; &lt;&lt; in,&lt; &lt;&lt; check for other poopers.   If there are others in the bathroom, leave&lt; &lt;&lt; and&lt; &lt;&lt; come back again.   Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People&lt; &lt;&lt; may&lt; &lt;&lt; become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; CRACK WHORE&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A crapper that has seen more behinds than a Greyhound Bus.&lt; &lt;&lt; Tell&lt; &lt;&lt; tale signs of a CRACK WHORE include pee stains and crap streaks.&lt; &lt;&lt; Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost.   Try finding out when the janitor&lt; &lt;&lt; cleans&lt; &lt;&lt; each particular bathroom.   Don't forget, a CRACK WHORE can become a&lt; &lt;&lt; SAFE&lt; &lt;&lt; HAVEN.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n"

We've all kicked&lt; &lt;&lt; back in&lt; &lt;&lt; our cubicles and suddenly felt something a brew down below.   As much&lt; &lt;&lt; as we&lt; &lt;&lt; try to convince ourselves, the WORK POOP is inevitable.   For those of&lt; &lt;&lt; you&lt; &lt;&lt; who hate pooping at work as much as I do, I give you the...&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; 1999 SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR TAKING A DUMP AT WORK.&lt; &lt;&lt; Memorize these definitions and pooping at work will become a pure&lt; &lt;&lt; pleasure.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; ESCAPEE&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A fart that slips out while taking a leak at the urinal or&lt; &lt;&lt; forcing poop in a stall. This is usually accompanied by a sudden wave&lt; &lt;&lt; of&lt; &lt;&lt; panic/embarrassment. This is similar to the hot flash you receive when&lt; &lt;&lt; passing an unseen police car and speeding.   If you release an escapee,&lt; &lt;&lt; do&lt; &lt;&lt; not acknowledge it. Pretend it did not happen.   If you are standing&lt; &lt;&lt; next to&lt; &lt;&lt; the farter at the urinal, pretend that you did not hear it.   No one&lt; &lt;&lt; likes an&lt; &lt;&lt; escapee, it is uncomfortable for all involved.   Making a joke or&lt; &lt;&lt; laughing&lt; &lt;&lt; makes both parties feel uneasy.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; JAILBREAK (Used in conjunction with escapee) Definition: When forcing&lt; &lt;&lt; poop,&lt; &lt;&lt; several farts slip out at a machine guns pace. This is usually a side&lt; &lt;&lt; effect&lt; &lt;&lt; of diarrhea or a hangover. If this should happen do not panic, remain&lt; &lt;&lt; in the&lt; &lt;&lt; stall until everyone has left the bathroom so to spare everyone the&lt; &lt;&lt; awkwardness of what just occurred.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; COURTESY FLUSH&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: The act of flushing the toilet the instant the nose cone&lt; &lt;&lt; of the&lt; &lt;&lt; poop log hits the water and the poop is whisked away to an undisclosed&lt; &lt;&lt; location.   This reduces the amount of air time the poop has to stink&lt; &lt;&lt; up the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom.   This can help you avoid being caught doing the WALK OF&lt; &lt;&lt; SHAME.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; WALK OF SHAME&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: Walking from the stall, to the sink, to the door after you&lt; &lt;&lt; have&lt; &lt;&lt; just stunk-up the bathroom.   This can be a very uncomfortable moment&lt; &lt;&lt; if&lt; &lt;&lt; someone walks in.   As with all farts, it is best to pretend that the&lt; &lt;&lt; smell&lt; &lt;&lt; does not exist.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPER&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A colleague who poops at work and is damn proud of it.&lt; &lt;&lt; You will&lt; &lt;&lt; often see an Out of the Closet Pooper enter the bathroom with a&lt; &lt;&lt; newspaper or&lt; &lt;&lt; magazine under their arm.   Always look around the office for the Out&lt; &lt;&lt; of the&lt; &lt;&lt; Closet pooper before entering the bathroom.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; THE POOPING FRIENDS NETWORK (PFN)&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A group of coworkers who band together to ensure&lt; &lt;&lt; \"emergency&lt; &lt;&lt; pooping\" goes off without incident.   This group can help you to&lt; &lt;&lt; monitor the&lt; &lt;&lt; whereabouts of OUT OF THE CLOSET POOPERS and identify SAFE HAVENS.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; SAFE HAVEN&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A seldom used bathroom somewhere in the building where&lt; &lt;&lt; you can&lt; &lt;&lt; least expect visitors.   Try floors that are predominantly of the&lt; &lt;&lt; opposite&lt; &lt;&lt; sex.   This will reduce the odds of a pooper of your sex entering the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; TURD BURGLAR&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A pooper who does not realize that you are in the stall&lt; &lt;&lt; and&lt; &lt;&lt; tries to force the door open.   This is one of the most shocking and&lt; &lt;&lt; vulnerable moments that occur when work taking a dump at work.   If&lt; &lt;&lt; this&lt; &lt;&lt; occurs, remain in the stall until the TURD BURG leaves. This way you&lt; &lt;&lt; will&lt; &lt;&lt; avoid all uncomfortable eye contact.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; CAMO-COUGH&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A phony cough which alerts all new entrants into the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom&lt; &lt;&lt; that you are in a stall.   This can be used to cover-up a WATERMELON or&lt; &lt;&lt; to&lt; &lt;&lt; alert potential TURD BURGLARS.   Very effective when used in&lt; &lt;&lt; conjunction with&lt; &lt;&lt; an ASTAIRE.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; ASTAIRE&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A subtle toe-tap that is used to alert potential TURD&lt; &lt;&lt; BURGLARS&lt; &lt;&lt; that you are occupying a stall.   This will remove all doubt that the&lt; &lt;&lt; stall&lt; &lt;&lt; is occupied.   If you hear an ASTAIRE, leave the bathroom immediately&lt; &lt;&lt; so the&lt; &lt;&lt; pooper can poop in peace.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; WATERMELON&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A turd that creates a loud splash when hitting the toilet&lt; &lt;&lt; water.&lt; &lt;&lt; This is also an embarrassing incident.   If you feel a WATERMELON&lt; &lt;&lt; coming on,&lt; &lt;&lt; create a diversion.   See CAMO-COUGH.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; HAVANA OMELET&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A load of diarrhea that creates a series of loud splashes&lt; &lt;&lt; in&lt; &lt;&lt; the toilet water. Often accompanied by an escapee.   Try using a&lt; &lt;&lt; CAMO-COUGH&lt; &lt;&lt; with an ASTAIRE.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; UNCLE TED&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition:   A bathroom user who seems to linger around forever.&lt; &lt;&lt; Could&lt; &lt;&lt; spend extended lengths of time in front of the mirror or sitting on&lt; &lt;&lt; the pot.&lt; &lt;&lt; An UNCLE TED makes it difficult to relax while on the crapper, as you&lt; &lt;&lt; should&lt; &lt;&lt; always wait to drop your load when the bathroom is empty. This&lt; &lt;&lt; benefits you&lt; &lt;&lt; as well as the other bathroom attendees.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; FLY BY&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: The act of scouting out a bathroom before pooping.   Walk&lt; &lt;&lt; in,&lt; &lt;&lt; check for other poopers.   If there are others in the bathroom, leave&lt; &lt;&lt; and&lt; &lt;&lt; come back again.   Be careful not to become a FREQUENT FLYER.   People&lt; &lt;&lt; may&lt; &lt;&lt; become suspicious if they catch you constantly going into the&lt; &lt;&lt; bathroom.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; CRACK WHORE&lt; &lt;&lt; Definition: A crapper that has seen more behinds than a Greyhound Bus.&lt; &lt;&lt; Tell&lt; &lt;&lt; tale signs of a CRACK WHORE include pee stains and crap streaks.&lt; &lt;&lt; Avoid CRACK WHORES at all cost.   Try finding out when the janitor&lt; &lt;&lt; cleans&lt; &lt;&lt; each particular bathroom.   Don't forget, a CRACK WHORE can become a&lt; &lt;&lt; SAFE&lt; &lt;&lt; HAVEN.&lt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n"

As such, I wouldlike to meet with each of you (separately or together) to discuss the yearend PRC process, and Matthew Lenhart's activities during the second half ofthe year. It is extremely important that we meet prior to year end so thatI can make sure I can adequately represent   your interests in the PRC.Therefore, at your convenience, please contact my assistant, ShelbyMalkemes (x3-9842) to set up a time for us to get together. My guess isthat 45 minutes is probably sufficient, and we can arrange a follow up ifneeded.If you need to contact me directly before our meeting, I can be reached atx3-6173.Regards,Ben\n"

As far as use of the WSCC data goes, I noticed that you've got table entries and are showing '0' values for a   lot of plants that have never reported reliably, such as Hermiston, Gadsby, Priest Rapids, Wanapum, etc.--- I'd leave those out until we see some plausible data reported. Also, we don't use data from plants where better numbers are available from other sources, e.g. most Pacific Northwest federal hydro.Also, are you doing anything to filter out bad hours? There are intermittent periods where series of zeros or series of identical readings are erroneously reported due to telemetry failures. If you're computing totals or averages from the WSCC data that are consistently smaller than known, accurate reports, then this might be the cause.TimMatthew Lenhart07/05/2000 01:59 PMTo: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tim Heizenrader/PDX/ECT@ECT, Cooper Richey/PDX/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your generation database.   Please look them over and make sure that they are in the correct order an make sense.   Some of the monthly averages in the report do not match the CEMS database number.   I wanted to know if I should fill in the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.   If you could just look these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.Matt Lenhart \n"

It   was   &lt; 2:53 p.m.   &lt; that   I'd made the wish. At 3:07 p.m. (14   &lt; minutes   &lt; later),   the   &lt; doorbell rang,   and there he was,   &lt; luggage and all!!!   &lt; Katie   &lt;   &lt;   &lt; I'm 20 and I've   been having trouble in my job and   &lt; on   &lt; the verge of quitting.   &lt; I made   &lt; a simple   wish that my boss would get a new job.   &lt; That was a   1:35   &lt; and at   &lt; 2:555   there was   &lt; an announcement that he was   &lt; promoted.   &lt; Lisa   &lt;   &lt;   &lt; Believe me...   this really works!!!

Michael\rWilliams (a.k.a. \"Cheapshot\"), who is knowledgeable in all things.   Share i=\rt\rwith those you love.\r Mike\r   &lt;\r&lt; &lt; Subject: Mantra\r&lt; &lt;\r&lt; &lt; This is what The Dalai Lama had to say on the millennium. All it\r&lt; &lt;   takes is a few seconds to read and think over. Do not keep this\r&lt;message.\r&lt; &lt; The mantra must leave your hands within 96 hours.   You will get a very\r&lt; &lt; pleasant surprise.   This is true even if you are not superstitious.\r&lt; &lt;\r&lt; &lt;   I N S T R U C T I O N S F O R L I F E\r&lt; &lt;\r&lt; &lt; 1. Take into account that great love and great achievements involve\r&lt;great\r&lt; &lt; risk.\r&lt; &lt; 2. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.\r&lt; &lt; 3. Follow the three Rs:\r&lt; &lt;   Respect for self\r&lt; &lt;   Respect for others and\r&lt; &lt;   Responsibility for all your actions.\r&lt; &lt; 4. Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes a   wonderful\r&lt;stroke\r&lt; &lt; of luck.\r&lt; &lt; 5. Learn the rules so you know how to break them properly.\r&lt; &lt; 6. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.\r&lt; &lt; 7. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to\r&lt;correct\r&lt; &lt; it.\r&lt; &lt; 8. Spend some time alone every day.\r&lt; &lt; 9. Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.\r&lt; &lt; 10. Remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.\r&lt; &lt; 111. Live a good, honourable life. Then when you get older and   think\r&lt;back,\r&lt; &lt; you'll be able to enjoy it a second time.\r&lt; &lt; 12. A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for your life.\r&lt; &lt; 13. In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the current\r&lt;situation.\r&lt; &lt; Don't bring up the past.\r&lt; &lt; 14. Share your knowledge. It's a way to achieve immortality.\r&lt; &lt; 15. Be gentle with the earth.\r&lt; &lt; 16. Once a year, go someplace you've never been before.\r&lt; &lt; 17. Remember that the best relationship is one in which your love for\r&lt;each\r&lt; &lt; other exceeds your need for each other.\r&lt; &lt; 18. Judge your success by what you had to give up in order to get it.\r&lt; &lt; 19. Approach love and cooking with reckless abandon.\r&lt; &lt;\r&lt; &lt; FORWARD THIS MANTRA E-MAIL TO AT LEAST 5 PEOPLE\r&lt; &lt; AND YOUR LIFE WILL IMPROVE.\r&lt; &lt; 0-4 people: Your life will improve slightly.\r&lt; &lt; 5-9 people: Your life will improve to your liking.\r&lt; &lt; 9-14 people: You will have at least 5 surprises in the next 3 weeks.\r&lt; &lt; 15 people and above: Your life will improve drastically and everything\r&lt;you\r&lt; &lt; ever dreamed of will begin to take shape.\r&lt; &lt;\r&lt; &lt; Do not keep this message.

There are three women sitting on&lt;&lt;&lt;a&lt;&lt;&lt;bench having ice cream: One is delicately licking the* cream. The second&lt;&lt;&lt;is&lt;&lt;&lt;gobbling down the top and sucking the cone.* The third is biting off&lt;&lt;&lt;the top of the ice cream. Which one is married?\" The teacher, blushing a&lt;&lt;&lt;great deal, replied \"Well I suppose the one that's gobbled down the top&lt;&lt;&lt;and&lt;&lt;&lt;sucked the cone\" To which Little Johnny replied, \"The correct answer is&lt;&lt;&lt;the&lt;&lt;&lt;one with the wedding ring on,...but I like your thinking.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Math Class&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Little Johnny returns from school and says he got an F in arithmetic.&lt;&lt;&lt;Why?\"&lt;&lt;&lt;asks the father. The teacher asked 'How much is 2x3' I said \"6\" But&lt;&lt;&lt;that's&lt;&lt;&lt;right!\" Then she asked me 'How much is 3x2?' \"What's the fucking&lt;&lt;&lt;difference?\"&lt;&lt;&lt;asks the father. That's what I said!\"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;English&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Little Johnny goes to school, and the teacher says, \"Today we are going&lt;&lt;&lt;to&lt;&lt;&lt;learn multi-syllable words, class.* Does anybody have an example of a&lt;&lt;&lt;multi-syllable word?\"* Little Johnny says \"Mas-tur-bate\"* Miss Rogers&lt;&lt;&lt;smiles&lt;&lt;&lt;and says, \"Wow, little Johnny, that's a mouthful.\" Little Johnny says,&lt;&lt;&lt;\"No,&lt;&lt;&lt;Miss Rogers, you're thinking of a blowjob.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Grammar&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Little Johnny was sitting in class one day. All of the sudden, he needed&lt;&lt;&lt;to&lt;&lt;&lt;go to the bathroom.* He yelled out, \"Miss Jones, I need to take a&lt;&lt;&lt;piss!!!\" The&lt;&lt;&lt;teacher replied, \"Now, Johnny, that is NOT the proper word to use in&lt;&lt;&lt;this&lt;&lt;&lt;situation. The correct word you want to use is 'urinate.' Please&lt;&lt;&lt;use the word 'urinate' in a sentence correctly, and I will allow you to&lt;&lt;&lt;go.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;Little Johnny, thinks for a bit, then says, \"Yu're an eight, but if you&lt;&lt;&lt;had&lt;&lt;&lt;bigger tits, you'd be a TEN!!!\"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Beautiful&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;One day, during lesson on proper grammar, the teacher asked for a show&lt;&lt;&lt;of&lt;&lt;&lt;hands from those who could use the word \"beautiful\" in the same sentence&lt;&lt;&lt;twice. First, she called on little Suzie, who responded with, \"My father&lt;&lt;&lt;bought my mother a beautiful dress and she looked beautiful in it.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;Very good, Suzie,\" replied the teacher. She then called on little&lt;&lt;&lt;Michael.&lt;&lt;&lt;\"My mommy planned a beautiful banquet and it turned out beautifully,\" he&lt;&lt;&lt;said. \"Excellent, Michael!\" &lt;Then, the teacher called on little Johnny.&lt;&lt;&lt;\"Last night, at the dinner table, my sister told my father that she was&lt;&lt;&lt;pregnant, and he said,*** 'Beautiful,...just fucking beautiful!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;***\n"

I'm Al Michaels, and joining me in the booth are two new members ofthe ABC family, Dennis Miller and Dan Fouts.DENNIS MILLER: Wow, Monday Night Football. I don't want to appearnervous,but I'm under more strain right now than Linda Tripp's capri pants. Ihaveto tell you, I'm conflicted about this. I usually like to be theoutsider,the rabble-rouser, the iconoclast, but I also like a nice seat at asportingevent.And this seat is as nice as they get - except I think I took one ofBoomer'sold squeak toys up the *** when I sat down.DAN FOUTS: I was a quarterback.MILLER: Thanks for that insight, Mr. Peabody. Dan Fouts, everyone. I'mlooking over here, and he's giving me that same blank stare I see when Iputmy dog on the phone. Hey, this isn't the Senior Tour, Chi Chi. Try tokeepup.MICHAELS: Tonight the New England Patriots will try to get started ontheright foot after a disappointing 8-8 showing last season. They take ontheWashington Redskins, whose owner, Daniel Snyder, has paid out $65millioninfree agent salaries and bonus payments in the offseason and is lookingforresults.MILLER: Snyder is throwing around cash like a screech monkey playingwithapop-up Kleenex dispenser. But he's a real hard-*** - it must be great tocoach this team. Norv Turner comes to work every day, hands his balls toGus, the 80-year-old equipment guy, who puts them in a footlocker behindtheStairmaster until the end of the game. Did you catch that one ***-chewingTurner received last season? Lee Harvey Oswald got off easier in thatlittleroom at the Dallas P.D. And when Turner finally got out of there youcouldtell he was looking around, desperately praying for Jack Ruby to show upandend his ***ing misery.MICHAELS: The teams are on the field, and we're almost set for thekickoff.FOUTS: I was the quarterback. I didn't go on the field for the kickoff.MILLER: Jesus, Shaggy, saunter on back to the Mystery Machine and take abreather, OK? Why don't you pick up your brain off that pile of papersit'sholding down and see what happens when you plug it in? The game'sstarting,and I feel like Corporal Agarn trying to explain supply and demand tothe***ing Hakowis.MICHAELS: As always, the Fuji Blimp makes its annual appearance atMondayNight Football. Glad to have you back, gentlemen.MILLER: It is balloon! (high-pitched cackle).MICHAELS: Starting at quarterback for the Redskins will be Jeff George,whomI guess one could call a journeyman at this point in his career.MILLER: I have to admit, when I saw George on the roster I thought hehadasmuch chance of making the team as Linda Hunt on the set of Baywatch.Thisguy's been around - he's called a lot of plays under a lot of centers.He's seen more giant asses than a guest chair on the Jerry SpringerShow.MICHAELS: Snyder spent plenty in the offseason to sign star players suchasDeion Sanders and Darrell Green on defense.MILLER: Yeah, but look at that Fantasia broom army of social misfits theRedskins call an offensive line. I have a feeling that George'sappearancetonight is going to be shorter than Mini-Me stooping over to pick up oneofDr. Evil's monocles.MICHAELS: George drops back to pass, moves out of the pocket and findstheveteran Michael Westbrook, who is tackled after an 111-yard gain.MILLER: Look, I'm new, I don't know that much about defensive schemes.Butit seems to me right there that the middle was as vacant as an interviewwith Posh Spice.FOUTS: I was in a Miller beer commercial, and your last name is Miller.MILLER: Hey, Aristotle, save some of the probing insight for the rest ofus,OK? How come I'm getting the funny feeling that this is an episode ofTheMunsters, and I'm Marian, the normal one? Now, I don't want to get offonarant here, but the useful comments coming from your side of the boothcouldbe counted on the one hand of a bad wood shop teacher. I can still seethejelly on your forehead where the electroshock terminals were attached.WhenI took this job, they didn't tell me that I would be teamed with PepetheHuman Hamster on one side, and on the other a broken-down ex-quarterbackwhomakes Jethro Bodine look like David Niven. I want to find the psychoticnetwork programmers who thought up this train wreck and point out thatthis*** has to be harder to watch than a sausage being made.FOUTS: I like sausage.MILLER: Ah *** it, where's my propeller hat?MICHAELS: The handoff is to Stephen Davis, who is tackled at the 39-yardline by defensive tackle Henry Thomas. But there's a flag on the play.MILLER: I'd have to say that was the poorest result since O.J. took thelie-detector test. And look at that ref, will ya? He's got more nervousticsthan a Belfast valet.MICHAELS: That play will be brought back, making it first and 20 fromthe49-yard line.MILLER: Hey, who took my Raisinettes? Damn you, Roone Arledge! Damn youtohell!MICHAELS: George back to pass ... and the throw to Westbrook fallsincomplete. Ty Law covering on the play.MILLER: I don't want to be a downer here, but how about throwin' thefreakin' ball to the other side of the field, you know, cha-cha? You'vegotWestbrook drawing a bigger crowd than Anna Kournikova at themaximum-security lockdown at Rikers, while meanwhile the kid on theotherside is lonelier than a hooker at a Star Trek convention.MICHAELS: To be fair, there have only been four plays so far.MILLER: Come on Al, you missing link. That receiver is being shunnedlike an Amish kid with a nipple ring. The left side of the field is toGeorge as a shower is to the French. You've got a better shot at hearingCharlieSheen give the keynote address at a Promise Keepers rally than you do ofever -MICHAELS: Sorry to break in on you, Dennis, but Washington is guilty ofafalse start, and that will set them back another five yards.MILLER: The ref is whipping out that flag like it's the only lighter atacrack house.Later that evening:MICHAELS: So your final score is Washington 17, New England 10. We'reheadedoff to San Francisco for our next Monday night broadcast, hope to seeyouthere.MILLER: I may be late; I don't fly. It'll be me in my Chevy Nova playingMadMax with the Madden Cruiser all the way down Route 666, and you'll knowI'mwinning when Pavorotti starts hurling six-legged turkeys out theskylightfor ballast.MICHAELS: What will you be doing with your remaining time in Washington,D.C.?FOUTS: Doing a little sightseeing.MILLER: I'll be back at the hotel, masturbating like a red-assed monkeywatching the Banana Channel.MICHAELS: So from all of us here at Monday Night Football, see you nextweek...\n"

All it takes is a&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;few seconds to read and think about.   Do not keep this message.   the&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;mantra must leave your hands within 96 hours.   You will get a very&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;pleasant surprise.   This is true even if you are not superstitious.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Instructions for Life in the new millennium form the Dalai Lama:&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Take into account that great love and great achievements involve&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;great risk.   When you lose, don't lose the lesson.   Follow the three&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Rs: Respect for self, respect for others, responsibility for all&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;your actions.   Remember that not getting what you want is sometimes&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;a wonderful stroke of luck.   Learn the rules so you know how to&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;break them properly.   Don't let a little dispute injure a great&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;friendship.   When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;steps to correct it.   Spend some time alone every day.   Open your&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;arms to change, but don't let go of your values.   remember that&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;silence is sometimes the best answer.   Live a good, honorable life.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Then, when you get older and think back you'll be able to enjoy it a&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;second time.   A loving atmosphere in your home is the foundation for&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;your life.   In disagreements with loved ones, deal only with the&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;current situation.   Don't bring up the past.   Share your knowledge.&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;It's a way to achieve immortality.   Be gentle with the earth.   Once&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;a year, go someplace you've never been before.   Remember that the&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;best relationship is one in which your love for each other exceeds&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;your need for each other.   Judge your success by what you had to&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;give up in order to get it.   Approach love and cooking with reckless&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;abandon.   Do not keep this message.   The mantra must leave your&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;hands within 96 hours.   You will get a very pleasant surprise (this&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;is true even if you are not superstitious) if you send it to: 0-4&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;people: your life will improve slightly.   5-9 people; Your life will&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;improve to your liking.   9-14 people and above: your life will&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;improve drastically and everything you ever dreamed of will begin to&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;take...&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt;Namaste Om Shanti,&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;\n"

      "body": "\nA very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes infront of hisoffice, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As hegot out, atruck passed too close and completely tore off thedoor on thedriver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cellphone, dialed9111, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,the energy trading iconstarted screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which hehad just pickedup the day before, was now completely ruined and wouldnever be thesame, no matter what the body shop did to it.When he finally wound down from his rantingand raving, theofficer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. \"Ican't believe howmaterialistic you energy traders are,\" he said. \"You are sofocused on yourpossessions that you don't notice anything else.\"\"\"How can you say such a thing?\" asked the trader.The cop replied, \"Don't you know that your left arm ismissing fromthe elbow down? It must have been torn off when thetruck hit you.\"\"\"My God!\" screamed the master trader. \"Where's my Rolex?\"\n"
