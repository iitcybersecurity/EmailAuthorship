He isbrilliant, and we could give him the topic of \"Enron and Market-RegulatoryFailure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior?

They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view on the North side.   If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as quiet.

      "body": "\nJim:\rIt was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.   Based on our conversatio=\rn,=20\rthis email includes the following:\r An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=\rds.\r Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=\row=20\rto remove those impediments.\r A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=\r to=20\rsign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20\rpossible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20\rorder clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20\rrates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.   I=\r=20\rhave attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose=\rd=20\ramendments to AB1X.   We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=\r=20\roption.\r Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.\r Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=\r=20\rand long-term electricity crisis in California.   We will deliver to your=20\roffice today detailed legislative language.   In those materials we will als=\ro=20\ridentify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed=\r=20\rlanguage.\r I hope that the information is useful.   Please do not hesitate to contact m=\re=20\rif you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=\rng=20\relse that I can do to assist you.\r Regards,\rKen Lay\r   Contact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes=\r=20\rin Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands\r David Parquet, Vice-President\rEnron North America\r101 California Street, Suite 1950\rSan Francisco, CA 94111\rPhone: 415.782.7820\rFax: 415.782.7851\r   2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\r Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\r Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=\r a=20\rstep in the right direction.   Utility stand-by charges have always been=20\rdesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20\rmonopoly prices from customers, or both.   But there is no reason to limit t=\rhe=20\relimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20\r1MW.   These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=\r=20\rCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=\re=20\rthe risk of black outs this summer.   We would propose lifting the cap by=20\roffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=\rf=20\rdistributed generation.\r=20\rExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20\rinvestor-owned and municipal utilities\r Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\ra=20\rstep in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\rinterconnection studies within 7 days.   California should ensure that this=\r=20\rrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\rgeneration.   In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\r=20\rinterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\r=20\rthrough executive orders or other regulations.   To the greatest extent=20\rpossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\re=20\rutility and place that control with the California ISO.   This could be=20\raccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\r Permitting and Air Quality Issues\rDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&amp;on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\r or=20\rgreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\rd=20\rtherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\rgeneration faces. =20\r Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-222-01 thru=\r=20\rD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\r=20\routput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&amp;distributed generation=018 facil=\rities.=20\rIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\r=20\rface local opposition.   The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\rinterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\r. =20\rThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\r 3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\r=20\rElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\r Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\r=20\rsuppliers.\rEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\re=20\rgoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\rHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\r=20\rconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\rWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\rredit=20\rrisk concerns.\rEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\r=20\ris working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\r=20\rboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\r=20\rgoing forward.\r Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\r Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority\rThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\rcharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.   From our=\r=20\ranalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\rCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.   =\rAs=20\rsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\res=20\radequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\r Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&amp;Prudence=018\rThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\r=20\rUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\r=20\r=01&amp;imprudent.=018   On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\ruse to=20\rallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\rpurchases.   Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\ree=20\rto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\r=20\rDWR has entered into with suppliers.\r=20\rAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\r=20\rRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\rIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\r=20\rnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\r=20\rthe specific ratemaking =01&amp;mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\roy to=20\rpermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\rs=20\rextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\rre=20\rDWR recovers its power purchase costs.   Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\ris=20\rdifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\r=20\rrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\r=20\rcosts.   Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\r=20\rsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\r=20\rfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\r Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\r We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\rsk=20\rissues.   We have identified three options:\r Amend AB1X\rThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\r=20\rPUC would accept as =01&amp;prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\rred by=20\rDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\rto=20\rensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.   This is the=\r=20\rpreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\r=20\rchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.   (See attached file=20\rentitled, =01&amp;AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\r Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\rthrough Contract Language\rThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\rimplement.   However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\rre=20\rtime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.   We have attached electronic=\r=20\rcopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\r=20\rwould need to issue under this option.   (See attached file entitled,=20\r=01&amp;cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\r Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\rAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\rcept=20\rother forms of credit from DWR.   Those options include a letter of credit,=\r=20\rcash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.   DWR officials have=\r=20\rindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\r=20\rprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\r=20\rcontract amendments.\r 4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 20001\r Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\rAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\r=20\rshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.   They diffe=\rr=20\ronly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.   Al=\rl=20\rcredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\r=20\rof 20001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\rlikely. =20\r CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\rsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\restimates.   California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\r well=20\rbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\rn=20\rin the West.   Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\r=20\rthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\runpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\ro=20\rdate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\rhe=20\rflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\rCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\rthis=20\rrequirement. =20\r Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 20001 include the early=\r=20\rdraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=\rre=20\rsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\r=20\rnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\rutilities.   Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\rt=20\rpace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\r=20\radded to correct the market imbalance until 20003 at the earliest.\r CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\r=20\rrolling black outs this summer.   The CEC paints a considerably more=20\roptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\r=20\rMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.   It is our view that California=\r=20\rshould view the CEC's \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\r 5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\r=01,s=20\rElectricity Crisis\r This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.   We wil=\rl=20\rdeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\r=20\rbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\r As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20\rcrisis must focus on four issues:\r Increase supply\rDecrease demand\rEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\rReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\r Increase supply---Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\rTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\r=20\rEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\r=20\rthan a year.   In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\r The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\rslation=20\rare steps in the right direction.   Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\rse=20\refforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\r=20\rin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\rrequirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.   Enron=01,s=\r=20\rproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\rtransfering credits between air districts.   In addition, it creates an=20\rinnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\remissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\rir=20\rdistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\rrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\r Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\rBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\r=20\rthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\r=20\rbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.   This can be accomplished mo=\rst=20\reffectively and quickly in two ways:\r Buy-down demand\rCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\rd=20\rto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.   California could likely reduce demand=\r more=20\reconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\rld=20\rbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\r=20\rthrough the summer months).   DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\rdetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.   To=20\rparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\rnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\rreductions.   Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&amp;D=\real=20\rBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\r Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\rTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\r An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\r=20\rfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\rReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\r=20\rverification.\rSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\r=20\rpaid for load reduction (=01&amp;Negawatts=018).\r The potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\re:\r =01&amp;creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\rcularly=20\rin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\r=20\rresources.\rreduction of   peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\relectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\rin=20\rthe state.\rfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\rk=20\rof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\rcustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\r=20\rresponding.=20\r We estimate that we could generate a summer 20001 on-peak demand response in=\r=20\rexcess of 4000 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\r=20\rsummer 20002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.   We further estimate=\r=20\rthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\rs=20\rthat amount.   We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\rdirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\rcontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\r Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\rcle:=20\rSB27X\rThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\rre=20\rcustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\r=20\rservice providers.   Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\r=20\rcustomers and businesses.   It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\re=20\rprohibition against Direct Access.\r Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\r=20\rdirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\rf=20\rWater Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\r=20\rcustomer migration. =20\r In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\r=20\rthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.   Procureme=\rnt=20\ris not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\rcondition in which the utilities now find themselves.   California should=20\rtherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\rfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\rnon-utility provider within 36 months.   To execute the transition, Californ=\ria=20\rshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\rin=20\rwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\r=20\rof utility load.\r Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\rvehicle:=20\rAB18X\rUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\r. =20\rIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\rimbalance.   In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\r=20\rand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\ria=20\rState government assume the role of =01&amp;electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\red=20\rperiod of time.   Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\re=20\rin California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20\rparticipate in that market.\r California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\r=20\rseries of staged rate increases.   California should design those rate=20\rincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\r=20\r=01&amp;shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\rould=20\ramortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\rd. =20\rIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\r=20\rFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\rrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\rAB=20\r1890.   Second, California can =01&amp;net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\received=20\rfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\re=20\raccrued due to the retail price cap.\r \n"

        " Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron on 07/10/2000 08:59 AM ---Betty Alexander@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT07/07/2000 06:37 PMTo: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON Subject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron...\"Management does things right; Leadership does the right things.\" (Peter Drucker)Today I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's Visions &amp; Values. An esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was recently approached by a hiring supervisor.   Totally unexpected &amp; unsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good feedback directly from clients &amp; Enron upper mgmt.   But after a short time, suddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.   No specific behaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to modify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to find another job.   Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), \"I want avoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget this.\"   To date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about Enron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, and there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.   I refer here to Cindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.   I don't care why it was decided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when things go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented professional more time.   She writes:...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in which to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.   I had 2 interviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.   I've not received answers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without acknowledgment of any sort.I have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened to them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 months to land her present job.   I am not afforded that opportunity now ...Jeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?   There are no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently &amp; discreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from HR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line with Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.   Cindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to honor her wishes with silence.   But you must see the irony here, not to mention the double standard in how Enron's Visions &amp; Values are applied to assistants all over Enron:   Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put out of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&amp;V expert!   I'm not blaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.   I remember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:   \"believing your own baloney.\"   He wasn't talking about Visions &amp; Values then, but \"believing baloney\" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.   You asked for candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.Jeff, thanks for asking and listening.   I and my colleagues are listening too, but seeing is believing.Respectfully submitted,Betty AlexanderSr. Administrative Assistant \n"

This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more\rthan are built in 42 states.   One of the main reasons for adopting the code\ris the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the\rTexas state plan for controlling smog.   Since the IECC contains a new\rstandard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=\rg\renergy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that\rserve the air conditioning load.

Your&lt; &lt; suggestions were excellent and much appreciated. I did speak with&lt; &lt; Jacqueline Grapin at the European Institute here and she was grateful&lt; for&lt; &lt; your suggestion that she speak with Mr. Bertrand Colomb, CEP of LeFarge&lt; &lt; Cement who also chairs the European side of the TransAtlatic Business&lt; &lt; Council (TABD). She said that he owns a farm in Northern Virginia and is&lt; &lt; here now but thinks that he is returning to Paris this weekend but could&lt; &lt; be&lt; &lt; available to meet in Paris in the next few weeks.   She also has good&lt; &lt; contacts with EDF and GDF and concurs that they are inseperable from the&lt; &lt; GOF but she will test the waters and advise.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; I have not had a chance to call Frank Farfone at DOW. Thanks for the&lt; &lt; information that Frank is chairing the Trade Committee of the BIAC and&lt; has&lt; &lt; a meeting early in February. Frank is a friend and has been supportive&lt; of&lt; &lt; our efforts to gain market access for energy services. I will call him&lt; &lt; later today or Monday to see if we might participate in his meeting or&lt; get&lt; &lt; him to make a pitch.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Your question about having Ken Lay meet with some key members of the&lt; BIAC&lt; &lt; in Paris to have a dialogue with them on his work in changing the&lt; business&lt; &lt; model to meet the real world of business that you would personally&lt; &lt; organize&lt; &lt; will be passed along to him. I think Ken would not only be terriffic but&lt; &lt; would enjoy the exchange.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Doug, you may be interested to know that we have retained Hills and&lt; &lt; Company&lt; &lt; to be our trade counsel and that Carla and Bob Fisher are spending time&lt; &lt; getting us prepared for the WTO negotiation to promote energy services.&lt; I&lt; &lt; am very pleased with the selection and the work they are doing for us.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; We miss you in the Washington community where for years you were so&lt; &lt; instrumental in promoting the trade agenda both as head of the IBM&lt; office&lt; &lt; and as chair of the US Council for International Business Trade&lt; Committee.&lt; &lt; However, as Secretary General of the BIAC at the OECD I already see your&lt; &lt; fine and experienced hand promoting the competition agenda. Sam&lt; Palmisano&lt; &lt; spoke to the Enron Management Meeting in November which was first rate.&lt; I&lt; &lt; followed up with the IBM Washington office to ask if they would join the&lt; &lt; Energy Services Coalition but so far they haven't.

If you are not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can get your presentation to Gene.The first drafts were a good start.   Most, however, read more like a pitch   [Paige, Barbara]   than an assessment/evaluation.   As you make your revisions, keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to best add value and manage the investment going forward.If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak over the weekend.   I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we can arrange a time to speak.   I will be generally available by phone Saturday morning through early afternoon.Thanks,Barbara\n"

Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, raising over $70,000.   This year's goal is to raise $1000,000, so the fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in this cause.   The benchmark for the team is the raise $6000 (pre-matching), but I want to outdo the fundraising of $14000+ (post-matching) we did last year.I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.   Checks are payable to MDA.FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.Please let me know if you have any questions.Thanks! Have a great day!Tim Ngx309998\n"

Baker &amp; Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hinesbeing the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.   Although not fullyagreed, there is strong interest on both sides.   Besides help on thedevelopment front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of abuffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating anyissues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providingdevelopment management).   The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker &amp; Botts) havetalked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks thisshould \"be the Authority's idea.\".   One issue is how much of our fee wouldapply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how muchwould apply to the Arena.   Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted youto know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, pleasegive me a call at 713-9666-2606.Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the skybrainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Optionsmarket in the commercial space market.   I will approach Jeff Skillingunless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.\n"

So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we   eliminate the September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for   many people as exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September   meeting (5 members).?

Wondered if you have had achance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?   I know you have lots onyou plate.   Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. Below is the earlier email I sent to you.   Thanks for the help.   Hope allis well with you.   Nov.2 email textWe at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger linkwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of theagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictablemarkets of the next decade.   One connecting point which we would likeEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in DynamicOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell andbeyond.The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a keyspeaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 20001.   Asdescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of threeconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations andstudents.   We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"livecase study\" at the corporate conference on &lt;underline&lt;March 28,20001&lt;/underline&lt;.You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.   Alternatively, thisis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Layand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders andthe Cornell community.   Other corporate leaders we have signed up for thecorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, KenChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announcedPresident of Kodak's new Commercial Group.   Each of these leaders has adistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved incontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.   We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of LeadershipWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from GoldmanSachs.   We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Companyand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus FrankRhodes, but these are still long shots.The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at theJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.   If Jeff or Ken wanteda platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.   Ifthey can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.   Again, thedate is March 28, 20001.   The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the samelines.   In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, itcould become the basis for the March conference live case studypresentation.   We believe that Enron is unique in its ability toliterally create new markets.   The question is how do you lead and managean organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in placethat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems tobe the case at Enron.   What kind of management philosophies, systems andpractices make this possible.I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 19993 and around19997.   As I understand it neither focused on organizational andleadership issues.   We would like to devote a small research team tobuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyerfrom the ILR School.   We would need access to a number of people in theEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fastmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficientway.Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas andhopefully test them with your top leaders.   We will do anything we can tomake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.   Asalways, thanks for your great personal support.Dick\n"

I also recently have become involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.   They are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.   I hate to ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a \"Core School\" in the MBA recruiting process.

        " Jeffrey McClellan/HOU/ECT on 04/28/2000 02:48 PM ---Jeffrey McClellan04/12/2000 05:10 PMTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: Cougars @ EnronMr. Lay,My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the \"Cougars @ Enron\".   We are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.   We had our kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and have received substantial interest in our organization.   I wanted to drop you a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.   As of today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to our group's success. We have several stated objectives:1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.   This will benefit the employees as well as the company.2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the University of Houston.   This will help to ease education costs.3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.Currently, here is what we have planned:4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at \"Frontier Fiesta\".   Frontier Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first home football game against Army.   We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.   We would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.   The university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.   We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would like the opportunity to share with you.   This group is designed to cater to its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be one of the most successful out there.   To achieve such a plateau, however, we need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.   To have you as an alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.   Would you consider making several appearances with us at our events?   Your participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most distinguished alumni.   If there are any suggestions that you may have as to how to further our group, I would love to hear them.   I understand that you are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that it has great potential.   With you support, we can attain a level of success that will set us aside from any other group.Thank you for your time,Jeff\n"

Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your interoffice mail concerning the below email.   I certainly understand that you will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is quite demanding.   I believe that this group will benefit substantially by knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.   Is it possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as such?   If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with which to work.   Please provide me any feedback you may have.As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional \"brown bags\" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.   I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.   If you could make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.   I will send you the date when I have it.Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.   We will have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.   I suspect that it will be from approx. 4:000 PM to 10:000 PM.   Please let me know if your calendar is free.I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your approachability.   Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all or even most of our events.   I would just like to let you know what we are doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.Thank you for your time,Jeff---"

Pursuant to thosemeetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to beheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area onthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairmanof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy andCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, HouseCommittee on Energy and Commerce).   The Energy and Commerce Committee hasoversight over Clean Air Act matters.   DeLay has requested support from andinteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY   After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay'scongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County localofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a shipchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.He has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frankdiscussion about our clean air issues.   This is the dinner my staff calledyour office about on Friday.   Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what heand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist inaddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that wealso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.   Mr.DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.   This willobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and adviseon strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.   Everyone inattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points inadvance.   There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before orafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.RSVPs TO DATE   Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, JimEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.   Charles Duncanand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.   Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and DanSmith are unavailable.   We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies toattend the dinner.My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis andto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at aboard member's home nearby.I trust this additional information is useful to you.   I will be thePartnership point person on this --- please do not hesitate to call me withany questions you may have.

What time is the meeting?RosieTo: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc:   Subject: EGM - all company meetingKen,Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the Hyatt Regency.   The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within EGM.   This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we expect about 5000 people.   We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have come in a few months.   I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.   We had a record Q1 with $1000 million of gross margin.   That was 50% of what they made in all of 2000.   Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information or assistance.Mike \n"

This year's keynote sessio=\rn=20\ris entitled \"The E-Commerce Revolution: Innovations and   opportunity in the=\r=20\relectronic energy marketplace\". This session has no   bullet points as I wou=\rld=20\rlike the speaker to address only the latest issues as   they see fit. My=20\rresearch has showed that the industry is very interested in   your opinions =\ron=20\rthis subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into   you busy=\r=20\rschedule.\r =01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look   at the latest adva=\rnces=20\rbeing made in the energy market=01,s systems and   technologies. The confere=\rnce=20\rwill be structured in two streams, offering   delegates and speakers the=20\rchance to tailor the event to their own areas of   interest. The streams wil=\rl=20\rbe partitioned into five areas:=20\r 1) Information technology for risk management\r 2) Information technology for pricing and trading\r 3) Data techniques and strategies\r 4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management\r 5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace\r Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems   being faced=\r=20\rby energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have   attached=\r a=20\rcopy of the program for your information. There will also be a   software=20\rexhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating   their=\r=20\rproducts, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.\r This conference will be of the highly technical level that   people have com=\re=20\rto expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage   participation=\r=20\rfrom speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and   issues at=\r=20\rhand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please   let=\r=20\rme know; any help would be gratefully received.\r This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy   &amp; Power Risk=20\rManagement Magazine and our extensive database.

We're in the final stages of closing a significant High&lt; Availability opportunity at Intuit.   Our San Diego sales team has done an&lt; outstanding job to position Compaq as their vendor of choice against Sun,&lt; HP and EMC.   Please refer to the email below for more specific details on&lt; Intuit's decision.&lt;&lt; Sometime next week Intuit's CIO, Jennifer Hall, will be presenting their&lt; formal recommendation to Stephen Bennett, President, CEO.   We've been told&lt; that he's friends with a Compaq board member.   I need your help in&lt; identifying that person.   Once identified, we'd like them to contact&lt; Stephen ASAP in order to communicate the following:&lt;&lt; Compaq's senior management, including the Board of Directors, is aware of&lt; the Intuit opportunity.   Compaq's committed, and determined, to meet and&lt; exceed their expectations.&lt;&lt; The Intuit sales team, headed by Bob Oakes, will prepare a briefing&lt; document for our board member to use.   Please advise ASAP.   Thanks for&lt; your help and support on this!&lt;&lt; Dave Fusco&lt; Area Director, Southern California&lt; Enterprise Business Unit&lt; 949-462-9762 W&lt; 949-462-9763 F&lt; 714-394-90009 M&lt; 8000-842-2460 P&lt; david.fusco@compaq.com&lt;&lt; Intuit Names Stephen Bennett As President, CEO&lt; Senior Financial Services Executive Brings Broad Experience Growing&lt; Diverse Businesses&lt; Mountain View, Calif. --- Jan. 24, 2000 --- Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ: INTU&lt; &lt;http:///www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU&amp;lt;) announced today&lt; that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president&lt; and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities&lt; immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive&lt; since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but&lt; will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to&lt; the board.&lt; Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of&lt; the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of&lt; General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous&lt; financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial&lt; equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $3330 billion in assets, GE&lt; Capital provides 42% of General Electric's overall profits and is among&lt; the world's largest non-banking financial institutions.&lt; \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong&lt; leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit's&lt; needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry&lt; knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven&lt; ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit&lt; to the multi-billion dollar level.\"&lt; \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in&lt; online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who&lt; will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I'm excited to have the&lt; opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take&lt; Intuit's industry leadership to new heights.\"&lt; During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six&lt; different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and&lt; financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of&lt; five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year&lt; generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and&lt; CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company's efforts to&lt; leverage the Internet across GE Capital's worldwide portfolio of&lt; businesses.&lt; Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE&lt; Capital's more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.&lt; Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion&lt; and net income increased to $2000 million from $80 million in four years.&lt; Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett's broad&lt; base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as&lt; business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses. And he gets the Net.&lt; Intuit's product leadership and Steve's ability to grow businesses are an&lt; ideal match for our future.\"&lt; Bennett added, \"Intuit's management team is strong, stable and experienced&lt; and works well together,\" he said. \"This is one of the few management&lt; teams to successfully and rapidly transform a company to the Net. I'm glad&lt; to have the opportunity to lead Intuit's continued growth and expansion.\"&lt; Scott Cook, Intuit founder and chairman of its executive committee, said,&lt; \"Steve shares Intuit's values. He's a straightforward, no-nonsense,&lt; results-driven executive who cares deeply about people. His&lt; values-oriented leadership style energizes organizations to great&lt; achievement, and I look forward to working with him.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;   ---Original Message---&lt;   From: Marino, Richard [mailto:Richard_Marino@intuit.com]&lt;   Sent: Monday, April 24, 2000 8:01 PM&lt;   To: Oakes, Bob; 'Janice.Farnow@avnet.com'; Velijanian, Fred&lt;   Cc: Bell, Lance; Pan, Andrew&lt;   Subject: High Availability Server Evaluation Results&lt;&lt;&lt;   We first want to express our appreciation to both HP and Compaq for&lt; their&lt;   efforts in helping make our evaluation project a sucess.   This did&lt; not&lt;   surprise us, as you have both been strong partners with us up to&lt; now.&lt;&lt;   As we indicated at the beginning, this evaluation was specifically&lt; aimed at&lt;   how well each vendor performed at helping us install, develop, test&lt; and&lt;   engineer an effective Oracle HA solution.   The ability to work with&lt; our&lt;   Intuit team and the strength of the vendors support were critical&lt; factors.&lt;   Certainly the difficultly of data migration impacted this project,&lt; limited&lt;   our performance testing, and remains of great concern to us in&lt; considering&lt;   any migration in the future.&lt;&lt;   We are taking the opportunity to provide you with our honest&lt; evaluation in&lt;   the hopes that this information may be of value to you.   We do&lt; however&lt;   consider this information confidential and ask that you do not share&lt; it&lt;   outside of your organization.   In addition we are providing it with&lt; the&lt;   understanding that you will not use the details contained herein to&lt;   criticize each other in an effort to promote your own position.&lt;&lt;   Here is a summary of our evaluation:&lt;&lt;   Sun Clusters - unacceptable, lacking features and EMC disk support&lt;   Sun/Veritas Clusters - acceptable, but uncertain support and future&lt;   HP Clusters - very good, strong features,   strong product roadmap,&lt; very good&lt;   technical support,   marginal sales support, variable support during&lt;   evaluation&lt;   Compaq - very good, stronger features, strong product roadmap,&lt; outstanding&lt;   support, higher risk&lt;&lt;   It should be understood, that there has not been a final decision&lt; and&lt;   management has not approved a migration plan.&lt;&lt;   We recommended Compaq, provided that we would be able to reduce the&lt; risk&lt;   factor associated with the recent release of their current software&lt; and&lt;   hardware architectures.&lt;&lt;   Management has requested that some further analysis be done (which&lt; were not&lt;   in the scope of this project) including cost/benefit analysis from&lt; our&lt;   customer's viewpoint and conversion cost estimates.   We believe we&lt; have all&lt;   the vendor information necessary to complete this analysis though&lt; they may&lt;   be a few pricing issues that will need clarification.&lt;&lt;   We will be in contact with each vendor regarding the disposition of&lt; the&lt;   loaned equipment we have on site from each vendor.&lt;&lt;   We again thank you for your efforts.   You will both remain key&lt; partners of&lt;   Intuit in the forseeable future and we hope to see our relationship,&lt;   whatever the final determination by management concerning this&lt; project, to&lt;   continue to improve.&lt;&lt;   Richard Marino&lt;   Lance Bell&lt;   \n"

This is the dinner my staff calledyour office about on Friday.   Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what heand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist inaddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that wealso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.   Mr.DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.   This willobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information andadviseon strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.   Everyone inattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points inadvance.   There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately beforeorafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.RSVPs TO DATE   Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, JimEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.   Charles Duncanand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.   Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and DanSmith are unavailable.   We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companiestoattend the dinner.My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis andto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly ataboard member's home nearby.I trust this additional information is useful to you.   I will be thePartnership point person on this --- please do not hesitate to call me withany questions you may have.

If you are not planning to meet that deadline, please see Lilia about how you can get your presentation to Gene.The first drafts were a good start.   Most, however, read more like a pitch   [Paige, Barbara]   than an assessment/evaluation.   As you make your revisions, keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to best add value and manage the investment going forward.If you have not gotten my feedback and would like it, we can arrange to speak over the weekend.   I will be traveling, but if you leave a voice message, we can arrange a time to speak.   I will be generally available by phone Saturday morning through early afternoon.Thanks,Barbara\n"

Tim Koller and I hopeit reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.   Ofcourse, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but Ithink we came as close as we will get.   There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,and we are working on that even as we send this off.   To the best of my knowledge there may now be two \"individualviews\"   to go into what is now Attachment D.   Len Baker may feel that thelanguage on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.   Baruch Lev feels that theSEC should not only issue a \"concept release\" to solicit broad publiccomments on a \"supplementary framework for reporting intangibles,\" but itshould create a task force to do the work.   (Most of the group feels thisapproach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)   Baruch alsofeels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggeratingwhat companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is towrite a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.   Hopefully, both ofyou will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if youfeel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please dostate them for the record.   Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,etc,   I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of youletting me know if you can sign-off on the report.   I'd appreciate this byMonday, April 16th.   Thanks a million.

I can only say that itwas a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that workedon the planning!Now to the final items.   We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf andregatta this week and we have a few questions.   The hotel and golf are easy.However the regatta is a different situation.   When we started this project,the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.   We quoted$85.000 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $1000.000 perperson.   This would not be such a great problem, however we had 333 no-showsfor the regatta.   This being said, we have two choices.   We bill those thatsailed for an additional $15.000 to make their charge $1000.000 which thenleaves us with a negative $35000.000.   Or, we also bill the 333 no-shows for$1000.000 each which puts us pretty close to break even.In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less thanexpected and some that were more.   We will have the final budget complete bythe end of next week.The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $1000.000or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.000?...Then, ofcourse, what should we do about the no shows?   Possibly bill them acancellation fee or the full fee?   Or, forget and forgive this time?I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle willbe here until the 20th of January.   We would like to get everythingfinalized before she leaves.Give us your thoughts.The EX-MC DirectorSharon\n"

Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.   We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.   One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .   (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.   The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that   we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.   Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.   We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.I am available for further discussion at your convenience.Regards,Tim DeSpain(x317770)\n"

I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he sees your message.RosieRebecca McDonald@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT02/29/2000 111:51 AMTo: Kenneth Lay@ENRONcc:   Subject: GhanaKen.I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.   You might remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing from the Ghanaian Ambassador.   Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate a meeting between you and Chevron.We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other possibilities.   We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on additional ones.   Clearly this is a bit of a \"cop out\".   I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.   And, of course, I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.   I have a good relationship with the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.   I will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.   If he does get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't believe.If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.   I hope the office opening has gone well.   I've extracted many a promise from participants to drink a pint for me.RegardsRebecca\n"

I'm working at it! Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues --- and needs --- before it explodes as a political issue --- and perhaps helps head it off (in contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking off the conference).??? It looks to be a very good and high visibility platform.? And they would be very keen and excited --- and honored --- to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in further on what they would like to accomplish.If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, that would be great. On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. Best, Dan \n"

As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra   and the Government of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.   We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the not too distant future.   Again, I believe this will send a very negative signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies investing in India.   I would think you might want to build one panel around this subject.

LayChairmanEnronDear Dr Lay,When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the20001-20002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious\"dream budget\" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most keysectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boostto the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget waswelcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international businesscommunity.On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 20001 to be held in partnershipwith the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in NewDelhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold andextensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have beenimplemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domesticindustry activity and foreign investment.As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, Iwould like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise andunderstanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from youany particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on theagenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may havewould also be welcomed.I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address andkindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).For more information on the 20001-20002 Union Budget, please visit thewebsite of the Ministry of Finance of India at http:///finmin.nic.in/fub.htmI look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us inIndia again next December.Best regards,Colette Mathur,Director,Center for Regional StrategiesWorld Economic Forum\n"

We\rinvite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon\ron Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this\revent.\r Our theme is \"20001: An Energy Odyssey.\" We are using the conference to\rshowcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to\rdeal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as\renterprise strategy and metamorphosis.   We can think of no one better to\rclearly define these major themes and priorities than you.\r I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in\rMontreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that\rthe regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=\ro\rheart).   The thoughts you offered --- on the importance of standards, the\ropportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of\rvital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.   We would ask you to include\rcomments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both\rguiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in\rmarkets on behalf of enterprises.\r The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=\rd\runiversity interests engaged in energy development and policy.   To bring yo=\ru\rup-to-date on the association, our Web site is ww.iaee.org. I'm sure\rRosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together\rfor you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=\re\r(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In\raddition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of\rRD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues\rand Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a\rjoint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology\rConference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.\r Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate\rsponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,\rwhich you helped to found.   Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=\rp\ridentify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary\rsession, \"Sustaining Development\" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn\rthinking around with our re-phrasing).\r I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.

is actually camping at the fairgrounds in LaGrange!).   Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.   I am challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.   I'll even give you a break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).   Of course, a flat pledge is also appreciated.   And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge to this very worthy cause 1-1.I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!   Thank you for your consideration.   If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.Sherri x3-5984\n"

The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is representedby one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class actionlawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).   The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is anominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is ashareholder derivative lawsuit.   What this means is that the plaintiffshareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages onbehalf of i2.   The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff isclaiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is thatall damages recovered would go to i2.   So why the lawsuit?   The Plaintiffcan recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of\"tag-along\" type of action.The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuiton your behalf.   Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firmtry and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriatetime, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.   Please let me know if youwould like for us to accept service on your behalf.   This is very commonpractice.I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.

A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will havea heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, andtechnology, media and policy people in the audience.   On the program, wehave nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and otherheavy hitters.   As you can see, there is a major technology slant to thisyear's program.   It will be a great event.   We would love to have somerepresentation from Enron in the audience.Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.   I haveattached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes thevarious levels ($10K - $1000K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakersand a prestigious audience.   Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count onyour organization for support.We anticipate a global audience of 1,5000 - senior people from the financialsector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all themajor media.

We checked and there is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) on all three Falcon 9000's.Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.   After the third ring it works fine.   That is all I know at this time.   Garrett Av is coming over today to check the system.I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.

This is not a permanent exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.   Reportedly, Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an amendment to a \"must pass\" piece of legislation during the waning days of this Congressional session.   This will be separate from the utilities' strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily   for Commonwealth Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 29444).Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA amendment and Gramm was reportedly   non-committal but not negatively disposed to the idea.   I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've reviewed it and convey their views to you.   According to MidAmerican,   the concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was Senator Kerrey's idea.   It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is \"at least three years away from happening.\"Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position on this amendment?   As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like Southern Company really want.   To date, this strategy has worked with the MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support. \n"

We have 90 minutes, Mr. Young will be hosting us to lunch during our meeting.   Joe Lemieux, CEO, is unavailable only because his calendar just didn't match up with your near term available dates.   My strong bias is that the sooner we have an opportunity to connect at the top the better, especially given our drive to close in Q-3.In addition to coordinating logistics, I will get briefing packets to your offices Monday describing the proposed transaction, deal related issues (details are not likely to come up during the meeting), key O-I personnel bios, and general information about O-I and its current business, including summary outside financial analysis.Regards,Michael\n"

Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.2)   He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on October 13.Thanks.Rosalee\"Walker, Bruce J.\" &lt;Walker@missouri.edu&lt; on 08/28/2000 04:17:56 PMTo: \"'kenneth.lay@enron.com'\" &lt;kenneth.lay@enron.com&lt;cc: \"'rosalee.fleming@enron.com'\" &lt;rosalee.fleming@enron.com&lt; Subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote requestThanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for theprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.   I'm delighted that you plan toattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficientway of reaching you, is two-fold:   1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the PinkneyC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.   Rather than designating theprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for someother area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member inthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call intoHarold Hook to seek his input.A few points of elaboration:   * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of suchpositions.   * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within thecollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to myapproval.   * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October13.This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or withEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in thecollege.   Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.   2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Societybanquet on October 13.   We would be honored if you would present a brieftalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future ofbusiness.   Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festiveevent.   By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who nowlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, havechosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin themorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitablefor the Davenport Society banquet.   Of course, you have great latitude inchoosing the topic you would like to address.   Please let me know if youwill serve as the keynote speaker.If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete theplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the PinkneyWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.   Naturally, ifyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.   My office # is573/8882-666888, and my home # is 573/875-2972.Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or notPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.   Apparently he had/has beenexperiencing some health problems.   However, the latest I've heard is thathe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'llsee him here in Columbia on October 13.   (By the way, if Pinkney and hiswife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner Iwill host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.   Ofcourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it'smy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)Ken, thanks very much.   I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&amp;R\"during your vacation.   I look forward to hearing from you.\n"

He will provide his perspective on&lt; India and the United States, how they perceive and misperceive each other,&lt; and how some of the misperceptions might be addressed.&lt;   .&lt;&lt;   12:000-2:000pm&lt;&lt;   Luncheon with Keynote Address by&lt; Secretary of State Madeleine Albright&lt;   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will present&lt; the Administration's position on South Asia over a luncheon following the&lt; Media Briefing.

He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O\"Boyle, head of the project finance group.   As you know we have done little with the Bank since Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by sanctions imposed against India.   Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank.   I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and referred it to Joe.   I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is available. I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.\n"

The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by thepartnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions fromeach such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributedto the campaign instead of being distributed.   I have discussed thisprocedure with Sue Walden.With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you andShell had agreed to.   The monies being contributed to the referendumcampaign are being contributed to a special purpose political actioncommittee (as required by law).   This special purpose PAC is subject to thegeneral Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.   As you know, one ofthese laws provides that \"a person may not knowingly make or authorize apolitical contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless theperson discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of theperson actually making the contribution . . . .\"   Pending a betterunderstanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $1000,000 in thepartnership's account.Please contact John Watson at 713-758-25556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you haveany questions regarding the foregoing.Sincerely,Michael S.

Admittedl, our phone service because of the office construction is not totally functioning.Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have been accused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status than I have been.I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.Joe\n"

It is so timely andcertainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (whoalso edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have muchgreater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directlyto me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.   Ifyou are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo theletter.   I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it wouldbe enormously helpful.   Please let me know what you'd like me to do.   Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.   Donna - KLay2000request.doc\n"

These are always difficult times.   As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.   But we can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege to have been raised in such loving homes. Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.   He is joining an excellent company.   I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his education working toward an MBA.   As we are living in an age where intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person to obtain the very best possible education they can.   As to our family, within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.   They met while they were both working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.   They're currently on their honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to Miami, Florida.   This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.   It was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.   It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,   20 inch little boy.   So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.   They are a great deal of fun.   We are doing quite well.   I am looking forward to seeing Ginger \"Rees\" Copeland when she comes to Houston.   I would be delighted to arrange tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit Houston. I hope you have a great summer.\n"

Awareness of Environmental Issue1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use ofnatural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.The impact on the business is becoming to increase.2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international frameworkfor dealing with the issue of global warming.(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM))) will be decided on at COP6,which is scheduled for November 2000.   GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.2. GHG Reduction1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic changeremains uncertain at present and further research is required.Policies will have to be devised that take account of developmentsin scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintainsflexibility.2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances ofeach country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,economic measures and voluntary measures.   Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in businesscompetition.3. Energy Conservation1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such alarge, mobile country, muchconsumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energyconservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmentalplans and other measures.Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energyconsumption efficiency of their products and use of energy attheir factories.4. Programme of Industry1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction ofproducts and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturingcost saving in the long run.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;(See attached file: Einvironmentalissue01118.doc)   Hitoshi Misaki, Group Manager   Relations-Group,   International Division TOSHIBA CORPORATION   1-1,Shibaura 1-chome Minatoku Tokyo   JAPAN 105-80001   TEL:03-3457-36661, FAX:03-5444-9217   e-mail:hitoshi misaki@toshiba.co.jp   YES T can ! - Einvironmentalissue01118.doc\n"

LayChairman and Chief Executive OfficerENRON CORPORATIONMexico Meeting 2000Managing New Expectations and Old ChallengesMexico City, Mexico 4-5 DecemberDear Dr Lay,Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence of the future key cabinet members and state governors.As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial relationships with the rest of the world, the new economy and the key issues for the country's main industries.Please consult our website, http:///www.weforum.org/mexico, where information will be updated as soon as it becomes available.For further information, please do not hesitate to contact Gisela Galicia at (41 222) 869 1450 or mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.org(   ) Please send me more information on the conditions for participation.(   ) Please send information to:- Name:- Position:- Company:- Tel.:- Fax:- E-mail:( XX ) I am unable to participate in the Mexico Meeting 2000.Please tick the appropriate response and return this form to Gisela Galicia by fax: (41 222) 786 27444 or via e-mail: mailto:mexicomeeting@weforum.orgWe look forward to hearing from you soon.\n"

I havereviewed this situation with care.   I want to thank those who provided mefeedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.\"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately restswith me.   I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by thetaped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.   His taped comments in noway reflect my own personal beliefs.\"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails andtranscripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on thisissue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religiousviews from his professional conduct?\"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continueto do so. His performance has met my expectations.   He is leading the bureauin a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.   He is moving our lawenforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.   Therefore, Ihave asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.   He has my strongsupport to continue.\"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personalreligious views.   I have a responsibility to review their employment statusif their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their abilityto perform their professional responsibilities.\"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because heis \"out of step with Portland\" could be used in other Oregon communities tofire more liberal public officials who are \"out of step\" with theircommunity's conservative majority.   My 30-year fight for tolerance goes bothways.\"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   Heassures me he is prepared to do so.   He told me he would rather help undothe damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, thanjust walk away.\"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders whoare gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.\"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance ofall Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.\"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokespersonto educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a \"gay disease.\"\"\"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's SexualMinority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.\"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.\"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.   I willwork to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand oursense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person'spersonal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; andto deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.\"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.   I hope you will join me.\"\n"
