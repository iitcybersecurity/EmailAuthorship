I firmly believe no company is in a better position to   understand the dynamics of the market or the importance of providing liquidity,   market-makers and transparancy to a market.?I am the CEO of a company called Bid4me.com, inc.? We are   an?start up with an eye for innovation in the internet solutions   field.? In particular, we are looking to bundle huge groups of small and   medium sized businesses into?blocks and force vendors to?bid   aggressively for their businesses in a?unique two-stage reverse auction   process.?We are?currently in stealth mode, however, our business   model so impressed Pillsbury Maddison Sutro, LLC (please see http:///www.pillsburylaw.com ) that they   accepted us as clients on a deferred fee basis.?Our vision is to work with Enron to bring greater savings to   SMEs.???We will bring hundreds of SMEs' internet access demands at once   to several vendors.? Very few of them will be able to accommadate such   demand without appealing to companies like Enron for the provision of extra   bandwidth.? We would like to not only bring the SMEs to the vendors to bid   on but?to offer the vendors a bandwidth discount through exclusively using   Enron's market-place.?This way everyone benefits, including Enron.? Enron get's   a huge block demand for bandwidth and?its market-makers get the   revenue.???Enron will also gain greater credibilty through getting   increased liquidity flow.?The vendors, e.g. Adelphia Business Systems, benefit by   receiving a block discount through Enron and by receiving revenue from a large   block of SMEs.?The SMEs benefit by receiving savings passed on to them from   the Enron discount and through using the soon to be patented Bid4me   model.?Our website is currently housed on a Stanford University   Server.? ? However, very shortly it will be housed on our own   server.? So in the future you will be able to reach us at http:///www.Bid4me.com?The site is password restricted so please be advised that   the:?login is:angelspassword is: engelsev1?Note also the login/password is case sensitive?http:///www.stanford.edu/~zpogue/bid4me/?If you double-click on the section 'For angel's eyes only' you will find   our current business plan and financials.?

The licence fees are usually $5,000.?Edgar.com have permitted us to have a free trail of their software.?We are looking for at least $1.5mm to launch Bid4me.? If   you have any interest in funding us or in working with us in the future I would   be very interested to hear your feedback. ?Last thing: as we are still in the process of applying for a   patent I would appreciate your discretion.?

A representative from EnronOnline had to fend off verbal attacks from competitors and from the audience, who criticized the system as giving Enron the ability to manipulate prices and provide it with an unfair advantage over competitors. Scott Coleman, an official at Altra Energy Technologies, said proprietary systems like EnronOnline, and systems being developed by a consortium of large market players, represent a danger to the health of the energy industry because of their current or potential market power. Altrade operates its own independent online exchange that is one of Enron's biggest electronic competitors. It differs from EnonOnline in that various buyers and sellers trade with each other with Altrade serving to clear the transactions. On EnronOnline, Enron posts bid and asked prices and is a party in every transaction. The proprietary EnronOnline trading system has been accused of market manipulation mainly because of its tremendous growth since going live last November and because of the market strength of its operator, Enron Corp. Enron is the energy industry's largest marketer/trader/risk manager and one of the largest natural gas pipeline operators. About 60% of its marketing and trading business today is done over the EnronOnline system. Critics charged that EnronOnline provides a tremendous advantage to its parent because all of the transaction data is thrown into a historical database that is available only to Enron. EnronOnline has handled more than 280,000 transactions worth $140 billion since going live. The proprietary system handles about 2,000 transactions every day with a value estimated at $1 billion, and most of its online business is natural gas and power sales and purchases. Why has the system been so successful? It's free, easy to use, low risk and there is a tight bid-ask spread, both EnronOnline and its competitors note. There's no special hardware required; everything is on the web and a transaction is as simple as a couple clicks of the mouse. It also provides a broad variety of information, including prices on 1,000 products, and is supported by the largest energy marketing firm. Although there are many other systems out there, few if any have the content, ease of use and price discovery of EnronOnline. Critics claimed that power enables EnronOnline to \"soak up liquidity\" in the marketplace, and in doing so give itself a tremendous advantage over its competitors. With each trade, Enron gains a little bit more information about its competitors' positions in the market. \"Over the long term I think the market will always correct itself,\" said Altra's Coleman. \"But in the short term, I think if any one player has enough of a presence in any one market they can cause prices to move in one direction or another.\" EnronOnline Director Bob Shults said the company is simply \"providing a service for our customers, particularly a bid and ask. But I don't think Enron has the ability to move markets. We are just putting a bid and ask out there, and if people want to buy at our prices, then fine. If people want to sell at our prices, fine then sell it. I don't think we have the market manipulation capability people suspect... We are not bigger than the marketplace.\" When asked specifically about historical data collected on those who use the system, Shults denied the company studies the buying and selling patterns of its competitors with an eye toward manipulation --- sort of the \"Big Brother\" of the energy marketplace. \"The historical information is not available,\" EnronOnline's Shults admitted. \"We just started calculating the indices and price reports... We are now providing that information to the market so everyone else has that information as well.\" He said Enron does not retain information about those who use its system. Shults did, however, warn that the system will make the U.S. energy market much more closely connected to the global marketplace in the future. With increasing demand for LNG imports and rapid price discovery of worldwide commodities on EnronOnline, for example, market activity in Africa and the Far East could have a more immediate impact on domestic markets. Quoting analysis conducted by Forester Research Inc., Shults also predicted electronic exchange revenues could grow from $5000 billion this year to more than $3 trillion in 20004-20005. ---,Copyright 2000 Intelligence Press Inc.

Hey Greg! It was terrific seeing you and Mary at the wedding (thought I wish I had spent more time talking to Mary). Now that I'm back in the office, I thought I'd send you this invitation to talk.   In theory, as long as you are using Windows, it should work, though I've had recent reports of some problems with Netscape.   When you get a mic and you think I might be on-line at work, just click the link below, agree to the certificate, and we should be connected. If it doesn't work, I'll have to call you to walk you through a demo of our other stuff. Let me know. Take care, Henri P.S.   Ulrich is still so *serious*! To join me in a live voice chat, click here: http:///www.hearme.com/vc/?henri@hearme.com P.S.   If you go there and don't find me, I might not be on-line anymore.   In any event, you can bookmark my web address to connect later. Also - the first time you connect might take a little longer than usual:   you might need to wait for your browser to be VoiceCONTACT enabled.

Please respond with any comments.   It is intended to go out on Tuesday at noon.   I will have the reorg group meeting Tuesday morning.KGAnnouncing the Formation of One Corporate Equity Investing UnitTo better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to our core businesses, Enron has formed one corporate equity investment unit.   This new unit, Enron Principal Investments, will combine the existing investment units of ENA, EBS and Enron Investment Partners.   Additionally, the Enron Wholesale Restructuring Group will also become part of Enron Principal Investments.   The strategy of Enron Principal Investments will be to work with the all the business units of Enron to identify, execute, and manage equity investments, which leverage the Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.   These investments may be in the form of venture capital, LBO's, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.   Kevin Garland will serve as Managing Director of Enron Principal Investments, overseeing all of its activities.   Gene Humphrey, Michael Miller, Richard Lydecker, and their groups, will join Kevin and his group to form this new investments unit.This new investment unit will report to Greg Whalley, in his capacity as an Enron Policy Committee member.   Please join me in congratulating and supporting Kevin, Gene, Michael, Richard and the other members of this group in this effort.Jeff Skilling\n"

      "body": "\nthis announcement has not gone out for that reason.   we have had a number of discussions about it since this was drafted and there seems to be some concern about it being inside one of the business units since it is supposed to handle investments across the company and would be bringing the EBS assets with it.   your suggestion that it might report to andy has some merit, but there may be other options.   what would you think if we established an investment committee consisting of me, rice, and delainey and made garland responsible to that group.   we would have all of the relevent business units represented and the p&amp;l would ultimately be allocated to the one in which the investment originated.   do you think that would work?   it might go a long way to satisfying all constituents.From: Mark Frevert/ENRON@enronXgate on 06/06/20001 03:17 PMTo: Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:   Subject: RE: Draft of Organizational AnnouncementI Shouldn't Kevin report into the OTC for wholesale as we discussed?

I do apologize for the short notice, but these things tend to happen quickly, and with little or no notice.   Please provide me with some possible future dates during the month of May and I will discuss them with Greg.Liz TaylorExec.

That is wonderful news forus!We have a T1 line in our classroom and we can connect using two-way video sothat you can see the class members and they can see you.   I know that we canalso arrange to put your power point slides on one screen and your face onanother, if we wish to.   At some point we'll get your technical people andour technical people to work out the details on the connection.   We wouldwant to verify soon that our systems are compatible.We can chat about how to use the 85 minutes we have.   I was thinking that weask the students to prepare the digital case, The Transformation of Enron1986-2000, in which you appear in a few segments in living color, and youlook great, I might add. Liz said she thought she could a copy of the CDfrom Sherri, Jeff Skilling's secretary, or, alternatively, I'll be happy tosend you a CD.   In addition to the case, I would like to give the studentsadditional new material (accessible on the course web-site) about Enron'snew ventures in the online and electronic network world.   (We could use alittle help from some of your people to get the best materials, I suspect).In class, we could have a case discussion led by Venkat and I for (say) thefirst half of class, and followed by your presentation/talk for the lasthalf of class. Or we can give you more or less of the time---let's talk aboutit.I was hoping that you could direct the focus of your talk toward topics suchas the following:1.   The strategy for new ebusinesses at Enron.2.   Enron's strategic advantages and competitive positioning in the digitaleconomy.3.   Examples of laws of network economics in the digital world4.   Implementation of Enron's digital strategy.We need to prepare specific assignment questions for the students toprepare.   Some of them could be taken from the introduction to the case,which we could supplement with additional questions from you or that wedevise together.This will be a great experience for our students and for Venkat and I aswell.   And we are flexible about how much time you want to take and alsoabout your specific topic.   So please give me a call (or email) and we cansettle on a plan.Thanks very much for your willingness to participate.Samuel E.

March 1st will mark the third edition of the newly designed orientation.   Based on audience feedback, the New Hire Network Team is searching for creative ways to engage the audience and encourage deeper conversation on the stage.   The Enron Wholesale Interview needs to focus on broad contributions to Enron, general business processes, and 20001 goals. Most of the wholesale business units have sent speakers to discuss their specific commodities, goals, and   contributions to EWS.Enron Networks   Beth PerlmanEnron Industrial Markets Tammy MulrooneyEnron Global Markets Mike McConnellYou may notice Enron Americas and Europe are not included.   Their speakers are unavailable.   Thus, I will ask questions about the gas and power industry as well as examples of initiatives in Europe.   We will also follow your interview with several pre-recorded interviews with lead commodity traders (i.e. Hunter Shively, Janet Dietrich, Dave Duran, etc).   They will focus on the trading responsibilities.I will be interviewing you on stage.   During your interview, we will be interrupted by \"Late Breaking News\" concerning power peaker issues and describing how Enron makes money with this initiative.   This is a 4-5 minute pre-recorded video that runs on the screens behind our interview area.   You will not need to contribute anything to this video.Here are the questions I have written.   Please give your feedback.(1)   Greg, you came to Enron in 19992 while the gas market was deregulating and the power market was moving towards deregulation.   Tell us what you experienced during this time. (a)   What risks did Enron take then? (b)   Did the Enron leaders have a real idea of amount of opportunities that would open the gas and power markets? &amp;copy;   What was the atmosphere at Enron during this time?   Excitement?   Frustration?   High Egos? (d)   Do you think that EES and EBS are experiencing the same type of excitement while they forge into undiscovered markets?Interruption:   ENA Investigative Report (Part 1) - Late Breaking News(2)   In 19996, you moved into the European market and lead the trading divisions in the oil and refined products.   (a) What was the atmosphere like in the International arena? (b)   Has the atmosphere changed over the last 5 years? &amp;copy;   What are some initiatives that are hot in Europe?(3)   Enron is entering the Japanese market.   They are focusing on the power, foreign exchange and metal markets. (a)   What are their goals in these markets? (b)   What are their challenges this year?   in the next 3 years? &amp;copy;   What other opportunities area arising in Japan?(4)   Enron Wholesale Services was created and announced in November 2000. (a)   What was the business purpose for this formation? (b)   What accomplishments/successes   have been made already? &amp;copy;   What is the business model for EWS? (d)   What characteristics does a market need to interest EWS?(5)   Finally, EWS and its business units have been losing its intellectual capital, its people resources, to the other divisions of Enron such as EBS and EES.   (a)   What characteristics are you looking for in future employees (b)   Recruiting is offering a $5000 incentive to Enron employees referring people with trading skills.   What are your needs in this area?Conclusion of interview:   You will exit the stage while I set up the audience for Part 2 of the Investigative Report.   Thanks for your time.Angela SprockEnron Corp713-853-63335\n"

In order for Enron to investigate this JV opportunity indepth, we   would like to propose as a next step a meeting at youroffices wherein   we may speak at some length to our ideas forcollaboration.   In addition to this proposal, as discussed, we remaininterested in   exploring a separate effort focused on the area of leasesecuritization   and would appreicate your guidance on how to proceed withinitial   conversations within Enron on this front.   Thanks for your consideration. I look forward to speakingwith both   of you.

It seems as though we are setting up one centralized trading/risk function but we will have overlapping origination functions.   I am sure I can work with whatever arrangement you make with Dave, but it seems as though we will be tripping over each other in the market.   Industrial coverage seems easy, but they want to call on IOU's and Munis in order to buy customers.   These are fundamentally large, structured short positions that are very similar to what we have been and are pitching.

He heads up an Asset Development group that is focusing on, among other things, power plant development in the southwest.   This sounds crazy - do you want to call Stan or should I?Portland General:They are developing generation in Oregon that is competing with one of our projects.   No one in RAC has heard of this yet.

I believe that you are running the efforts of that group, and I am more than excited to speak with you about employment opportunities.Although you have interviewed me in the past for the crude oil options trading position (19996, my first year at Enron), the passage of time hopefully allows me to refresh you on my background, in brief.Pursuant to working at Enron, I currently work at Chematch.com, a leading online, real-time B2B Exchange, concentrating in the petrochemical and polymer industry, but with reaches into the fuel products arena.? I was one of the first dozen employees. We were the first movers of our business type in this vertical.?

Most recently, I was promoted from Vice President to Vice President &amp; Senior Officer, heading the entire content portion of our firm (petrochem.net).Prior to joining Enron, I attended the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and received an MBA with concentrations in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior to that, I spent three years on Wall Street with Merrill Lynch and Prudential Securities, in in both investment banking and FI capital markets.If you need a couple of quick recommendations from Enron, I would humbly suggest Fred Lagrasta, Jeff Shankman, Harold Buchanan, Donald M. Black, Greg Woulfe, and others of your choice.Attached is my resume for your review.?

Skilling gave the keynot=\re\rlast year, announcing the launch of Enron Online. Divisional presidents fro=\rm\rHalliburton, Equiva, Vastar and Reliant Energy participated in the keynote\rsession.   More than 1,450 executives attended.   Given the large number of\rearly registrations and the strong program, we expect this year=01,s to be =\rmuch\rlarger.\r Ideally, you would give a one-year update on the growth of the EOL and\rdescribe your vision for Enron's future e-business initiatives and\robjectives in this area.   The target audience for the conference is senior\renergy management who are integrating technology into their core business\rstrategies.\r Interactive Energy 2000, which will have more than 1000 speakers, will cover\rtechnology development across five sectors:\r 1) Upstream\r2) Transportation &amp; Logistics\r3) Processes (refining, petrochem, power gen. and gas processing)\r4) Wholesale\r5) Retail\r Press Coverage:\rThe conference has been a high priority for the trade press as well as the\rgeneral media.   At previous years' events, we had editors from more than\rtwenty general business and trade publications, including the Wall Street\rJournal, FT Energy, Oil &amp; Gas Journal, Oil &amp; Gas Investor, World Oil,\rBloomberg, PR Newswire, Dow Jones New Retrieval and others.   National Publi=\rc\rRadio and All Things Considered aired interviews of our key speakers.   As\rresult of last year's success, we have numerous media sponsors this year,\rincluding Energy Markets, McGraw Hill, Oil &amp; Gas Investor, Houston Business\rJournal, PR Newswire, Utility IT, Petroleum Economist, EnergyCentral.com,\rEnergy Commerce and others.\r Benefits:\r Enron Net Works will benefit in four ways:\r ? First, you will educate customers and partners.   Cisco is bringing some 7=\r0\rsenior utility executives from Europe to attend; they would be most\rinterested in your perspectives.   Energy buyers from such organizations as\rFord, United Technologies and e-Mall (an eight-state buying consortium) hav=\re\rattended in previous years.\r ? Second, you will motivate management from such vendors as Ariba, Luminant=\r,\rIBM, i2 and SAP and many others to develop IT solutions specific to Enron=\r=01,s\rvision.\r ? Third, you will educate employees.   Some 43 executives from Enron attende=\rd\rlast year=01,s event.\r ? Fourth, you will persuade recruits.   Capable professionals in this area\rare in high demand. Rising stars of the energy industry will learn of\rEnron's innovations and rapid growth.\r I hope that your calendar is clear.   Look forward to the possibility of\rworking with you and your staff.   I'll call to follow up.\r Yours respectfully,\r Bob Nimocks\rPresident\rZeus Development Corporation\r2424 Wilcrest Dr., Suite 250\rHouston, TX 777042\rMain: 713-952-95000\rDirect: 832-2000-3706\re-mail: bnimocks@zeusdevelopment.com   \n"

I would like to talk to you some more aboutthe opportunities available in Enron Networks. Twoareas I thought would be interesting would either behelping to structure a market for Enron Networks toenter, or help develop a market that Enron Networks isin the process of entering.A couple of things that I thought were interestingabout your strategy for B2B is that unlike mostbusiness plans where the strategy is build the siteand the volume will come, Enron uses it's own volumeto entice other people to participate. What moste-commerce sites want to do is charge for the datingprocess, but in reality this has very little valueadded unless the market is coupled with afinance/clearinghouse function and a physical delivarysystem for physical goods. We addressed some of theseissues in the ilogex business plan.I have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan togive you an idea of some of my thoughts on e-commerce. I look forward to talking to you tommorrow morning.Thanks,Brad___Do You Yahoo!?Send instant messages &amp; get email alerts with Yahoo!

I don't know Mike well but met him a couple oftimes in London in connection with a financing that Chase led on the TGTLsituation.Anyway, you had asked about other presenters and format.The format will be a panel dicussion during which each company will give a 10 -15 minute business overview probably in a powerpoint format with books foraudience members to take away. Following the formal presentations there will bequestions both from the floor and from the moderator to be addressed by allpanel members.Assuming that EnronOnline is able to participate on the Energy Exchange panelthe moderator will be yours truly --- so I'll be serving up some softballs forMike.The other confirmed panelists for the Energy Exchange session are:Houstonstreet.com --- Howard SmithEnemetrix.com - John GausDownstream.com - John IrelandWe are expecting good attendance from industry (both incumbants as well as neweconomy types) as well as from the buyside. So far there are over 1000participants and I expect we see a number of additional confirmations betweennow and the conference.Logistically, Mike would need to fly to San Francisco on Wed Sept 20 --- we willwork with him on transport up to Silverado Resort in Napa Valley. The panel willbe first thing on Thursday Spet 21 (probably around 9 am) after which Mike willbe free to attend other conference sessions, play golf, tour wineries orwhatever.The full list of sessions   includes:Distributed GenerationCommunicationsB2BInvestor PerspectivesEnergy ExchangesEnergy RetailVenture StageEuropean New Energy\n"

Mkt still expecting Chinese to come in and buy Oman once the diffs get down to the mid teens. However, AG is getting cleaned up for June loaders.   Reported that CPC Taiwan mutually agreed with a seller (Statoil ) to cancel a early June loader of Oseberg that they had bought a couple of weeks ago.   They say they won't rebook it now that the strike is over. Paper -   FTB's were off early on the back of announcement that Norweigian strike was over.   Recovered later in the day on the Brent recovery. Tapis weaker vs Brent with EFS @ 35 and Dubai weaker as well with EFS @ 2.28. Gasoil : Once again, Singapore gasoil lagged behind crude and other products. June swap traded between 26.35 - 26.60 usd/bbbl with East / West at - 10 usd/mt (versus - 8 usd/mt yesterday). Front-to-back widened with June / July at 0.15 / 0.30 and June / Q3 also improved by 10 / 15 cents/bbbl. Crack under pressure with Q3 at 2.90 / 3.20, a drop of 20 cents/bbbl.   Three sellers this evening : Onyx , Shell and Marc Rich with the most aggressive offer at 27.0 usd/bbbl or MOPS + 0.50,   Caltex bid a cargo at 26.30 usd/bbbl or MOPS + 0.20 but no deal concluded. Jet / kerosene : Regrade being sell down with June at 1.85 / 2.000 and July at 2.40 / 2.50 by the end of the day.   With limited outlets for the prompt jet, front-to-back will be forced to open up so that some barrels will go to the storage. Four sellers this evening (including three majors) - Caltex, Shell, BP and J Aron with the most aggressive offer at 28.30 usd/bbbl, but still attract no buying interest.fueloil-physical price tread lower as bp n hinleong test the mkt without bidding today n shell offer down to 153/mt.paper held yesterday nos thru the day at 143.5-1444.25 june jul 138-139 jun/jul held at 5/5.5 crack widen further to 1.5/bbbl for june n 1.9/bbbl for jul negative.kepco tender to buy lsfo for june dlvry.physical mtk is tight thru may n early june for 180cst n will see the strength to surface later in the mth when the main players price in cargo totally.stay bullish on fo though temporary n time being looks soft.\n"

To that end, we have made the following changes:\rFriday Evening Dinner.   The dinners will be held at the same restaurant. =\r =20\rWe will provide transportation for all candidates.   We will continue to hav=\re=20\rsmall tables of six individuals that will include two (2) Enron employees a=\rnd=20\rfour (4) students.

It's best in the future to copy me on all emails to Whalley for a faster response.Many Thanks,LizD'Arcy Carroll@ENRON12/04/2000 03:28 PMTo: Mark Frevert/NA/Enron@Enron, Greg Whalley@ECTcc: Monica Matias/SA/Enron@Enron Subject: Mark/Greg, Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like to discuss with you:Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America etc.,... expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in Brazil.Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), including e-business/Networks issues.Finance expertise   - the critical role that functional groups like Enron Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South America and elsewhereMy priority to help form and be re-assigned to a \"Bundle Products\" Origination business unit   designed to initiate transactions which specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp &amp; paper, steel networks, crude and products, and insurance/global risk. Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background and experience and   mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location process,   needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.   Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf. \n"

        " Greg Whalley/HOU/ECT on 07/07/2000 08:58 AM ---Michael L Brown@ENRON06/20/2000 03:57 PMTo: John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Greg Whalley, John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: RedMeteor.com John,   I had lunch today with David Ownby (plus, Brent Larsen and Michael Chang of RedMeteor.com).   David suggested that perhaps there could be some sort of arrangement between RedMeteor.com and EOL wherein each could benefit from the other's platform.   He was referring specifically to the refined products and crude oil areas (where they are primarily physical and we are primarily financial).   I am under the impression that there may have been some contact earlier this year between Enron management and Vincent Di Cosimo of RedMeteor and I had heard the names of Greg Whalley and John Sherriff mentioned in that regard.   Is that correct and did anything ever materialize?   As you know RedMeteor and Vitol are in the process of formalizing a strategic alliance to \"aid in their positioning in the global marketplace\" as reported in the media.   And the person involved from Vitol, Mike Loya, is a person that I have known for years, but have not discussed this topic with him.   Is there anything worth pursuing with RedMeteor?Regards,Mike \n"
