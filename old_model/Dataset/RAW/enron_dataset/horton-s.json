We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the transactions being proposed.   I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue.2.   We need to determine EBS interest in this business...ie are they a buyer or seller of Portland metro dark fiber.   If they want to be in this business wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a sale?3.   A project of this size will take Jeff's approval.

I visited you with my colleague in November1999 to discuss possible collaboration between Enron and Mitsui.   While wecould not identify any project which we can jointly proceed with, thediscussion we had with you at that time was very useful for us.The reason for me to writing this now is that I heard from some people thatEnron is now considering sale of Enron's wind power assets (Enron Wind).Wethink that the Wind power will be more popular in Japan as well and we havean interest in Enron Wind.   If you have any idea about status of Enron'sthis effort, it would be very helpful if you could share some idea with me,like price level Enron is thinking of and whether or not any actualnegotiation is going on, etc.I will be travelling most of next two weeks and it would be very convenientif you could e-mail me your response.Regards,Ichiro Tamura, Mitsui USATel: 212-878-4291Cellular: 718-3444-33385E-Mail: iatamura@nyc.mitsui.com\n"

Love Clara--- Original Message ---From: \"maggie welsh\" &lt;maggiewelsh@unidial.com&lt;To: &lt;Undisclosed-Recipient:@unidial.com;&lt;Sent: Thursday, May 03, 20001 8:25 PM&lt;&lt;   &lt; A time comes in your life when you finally get it...&lt; &lt; When in the midst of all your fears and insanity&lt; &lt; you stop dead in your tracks and somewhere the voice&lt; &lt; inside your head cries out - ENOUGH! Enough fighting&lt; &lt; and crying or struggling to hold on. And, like a&lt; &lt; child quieting down after a blind tantrum, your sobs&lt; &lt; begin to subside, you shudder once or twice, you blink&lt; &lt; back your tears and through a mantle of wet lashes you&lt; &lt; begin to look at the world through new eyes. This is&lt; &lt; your awakening. You realize that it's time to stop&lt; &lt; hoping and waiting for something to change, or for&lt; &lt; happiness, safety and security to come galloping over&lt; &lt; the next horizon. You come to terms with the fact that&lt; &lt; he is not Prince Charming and you are not Cinderella&lt; &lt; and that in the real world there aren't always&lt; &lt; fairy tale endings (or beginnings for that matter) and&lt; &lt; that any guarantee of \"happily ever after\" must begin&lt; &lt; with you, and in the process... a sense of&lt; &lt; serenity is born of acceptance. You awaken to the fact&lt; &lt; that you are not perfect, and that not everyone will&lt; &lt; always love, appreciate or approve of who or what you&lt; &lt; are... and that's OK.(They are entitled to their own&lt; &lt; views and opinions.)&lt; &lt; And you learn the importance of loving and championing&lt; &lt; yourself, and in the process... a sense of newly found&lt; &lt; confidence is born of self-approval. You stop bitching&lt; &lt; and blaming other people for the things&lt; &lt; they did to you (or didn't do for you) and you learn&lt; &lt; that the only thing you can really count on is&lt; &lt; the unexpected. You learn that people don't always&lt; &lt; say what they mean or mean what they say, and that not&lt; &lt; everyone will always be there for you, and that it's&lt; &lt; not always about you. So, you learn to stand on your&lt; &lt; own and to take care of yourself and in the process...&lt; &lt; a sense of safety &amp; security is born of self-reliance.&lt; &lt; You stop judging and pointing fingers, and you begin&lt; &lt; to accept people as they are, and to overlook their&lt; &lt; shortcomings and human frailties and, in the&lt; &lt; process... a sense of peace &amp; contentment is born of&lt; &lt; forgiveness.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; You realize that much of the way you view yourself,&lt; &lt; and the world around you, is a result of all the&lt; &lt; messages and opinions that have been ingrained into&lt; &lt; your psyche. And you begin to sift through all the&lt; &lt; crap you've been fed about how you should behave, how&lt; &lt; you should look, how much you shouldn't weigh, what&lt; &lt; you should wear, where you should shop, what you&lt; &lt; should drive, how and where you should live, what&lt; &lt; you should do for a living, who you should sleep with,&lt; &lt; who you should marry, what you should expect of&lt; &lt; a marriage, the importance of having and raising&lt; &lt; children, or what you owe your parents. You learn to&lt; &lt; open up to new worlds and different points of view. And&lt; &lt; you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and&lt; &lt; what you really stand for.&lt; &lt; You learn the difference between wanting and needing,&lt; &lt; and you begin to discard the doctrines and values&lt; &lt; you've outgrown, or should never have bought into to&lt; &lt; begin with, and in the process... you learn to respect&lt; &lt; your instincts.&lt; &lt; You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive.&lt; &lt; And that there is power and glory in creating&lt; &lt; and contributing, and you stop maneuvering&lt; &lt; through life merely as a \"consumer\" looking for your&lt; &lt; next fix. You learn that principles such as honesty&lt; &lt; and integrity are not the outdated ideals of&lt; &lt; a bygone era, but the mortar that holds together the&lt; &lt; foundation upon which you must build a life. You learn&lt; &lt; that you don't know everything, it's not&lt; &lt; your job to save the world, and that you can't teach a&lt; &lt; pig to sing. You learn to distinguish between guilt&lt; &lt; and responsibility, and the importance of setting&lt; &lt; boundaries and learning to say NO.&lt; &lt; You learn that the only cross to bear is the one&lt; &lt; you choose to carry, and that martyrs get&lt; &lt; burned at the stake.&lt; &lt; Then you learn about love; romantic love and familial&lt; &lt; love.&lt; &lt; You learn that you will not be more beautiful,&lt; &lt; more intelligent, more lovable, or important because&lt; &lt; of the man or woman on your arm or the child that&lt; &lt; bears your name. You learn to look at relationships as&lt; &lt; they really are and not as you would have them be. You&lt; &lt; stop trying to control people, situations,&lt; &lt; and outcomes. You learn that just as people grow and&lt; &lt; change, so it is with love... and you learn that love is a verb, it is&lt; &lt; action.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; And you look in the mirror and come to terms with the&lt; &lt; fact that you will never be a size 5 or a perfect 10&lt; &lt; and you stop trying to compete with the image inside&lt; &lt; your head and agonizing over how you \"stack up.\"&lt; &lt; You come to the realization that you deserve to be&lt; &lt; treated with love, kindness, sensitivity, and&lt; &lt; respect, and you will not settle for less. And you&lt; &lt; allow only the hands of a lover who cherishes you, to&lt; &lt; glorify you with his or her touch... and in the&lt; &lt; process you internalize the meaning of self-respect.&lt; &lt; And you learn that your body really is your temple.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; You begin eating a balanced diet, drinking more&lt; &lt; water, and taking more time to exercise. You learn&lt; &lt; that fatigue diminishes the spirit and can create&lt; &lt; doubt and fear, so you take more time to rest. And,&lt; &lt; just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels the soul,&lt; &lt; so you take more time to laugh and to play. You learn&lt; &lt; that, for the most part, in life you get what you&lt; &lt; believe you deserve... and that much of life&lt; &lt; truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy. You learn that&lt; &lt; anything worth achieving is worth working for, and&lt; &lt; that wishing for something to happen is different&lt; &lt; from working toward making it happen. More&lt; &lt; importantly, you learn that in order to achieve&lt; &lt; success, you need direction, discipline, and&lt; &lt; perseverance. You also learn that no one can do&lt; &lt; it all alone and that it's OK to risk asking for&lt; &lt; help. You learn that the only thing you must truly fear&lt; &lt; is the great robber baron of all time. FEAR&lt; &lt; itself. You learn to step right into and through your&lt; &lt; fears, because you know that whatever happens you can&lt; &lt; handle it, and to give in to fear is to&lt; &lt; give away the right to live life on your terms.&lt; &lt; And you learn to fight for your life and not to&lt; &lt; squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.&lt; &lt; You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't&lt; &lt; always get what you think you deserve, and that&lt; &lt; sometimes bad things happen to unsuspecting, good&lt; &lt; people. On these occasions you learn not to&lt; &lt; personalize things. You learn that God isn't punishing&lt; &lt; you or failing to answer your prayers. It's just life&lt; &lt; happening. And you learn to deal with evil in its most&lt; &lt; primal state - the ego.&lt; &lt; You learn that feelings such as anger, envy, and&lt; &lt; resentment must be understood and redirected, or they&lt; &lt; will suffocate the life out of you and poison the&lt; &lt; universe that surrounds you. You learn to admit when&lt; &lt; you are wrong and to build bridges instead of&lt; &lt; walls. You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in&lt; &lt; many of the simple things we take for granted, things&lt; &lt; that millions of people upon the earth can only dream&lt; &lt; about; a full refrigerator, clean running water, a&lt; &lt; soft warm bed, a long hot shower.&lt; &lt; Slowly, you begin to take responsibility for&lt; &lt; yourself... by yourself, and you try to make yourself&lt; &lt; a promise ---to never betray yourself . And&lt; &lt; you hang a wind chime outside your window so you can&lt; &lt; listen to the wind. And you make it a point&lt; &lt; to keep smiling, to keep trusting, and to stay open to&lt; &lt; every wonderful possibility. Finally, with courage in&lt; &lt; your heart and with God by your side,&lt; &lt; you take a stand, you take a deep breath, and you&lt; &lt; begin to design the life you want to live as best as&lt; &lt; you can.&lt;&lt;&lt;   &lt; Fly, fly do not fear&lt; &lt; Don't waste a breath, don't shed a tear&lt; &lt; Your heart is pure, your soul is free&lt; &lt; Be on your way, don't wait for me&lt; &lt; Above the universe you'll climb&lt; &lt; On beyond the hands of time&lt; &lt; The moon will rise, the sun will set&lt; &lt; But I won't forget&lt;&lt;\n"

We expect it to include:   1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout schedule2)   a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State governors within 90 days from date of enactment3)   and environmental \"anti-backsliding\" provision focused only on air-toxics and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for conventional gasoline)4) provisions for MTBE producer \"transition assistance\"Brief analysis:   We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than previous efforts.   A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but this will probably be the leading effort.   As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the \"transition assistance\" piece --- which is still largely undefined in the legislation --- but we are pleased with the inclusion of a \"placeholder\" while the Senate decides on the best approach.   We will continue to lead the development of such incentives (which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a \"date certain\" gives producers more flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some opposition from the ethanol community --- who just want a simple MTBE ban.The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly lame.   We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely that environmental groups will want a bit more.One political factor --- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which will consider this bill.   They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the committee.   The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE --- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through Committee.I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.Jeffrey KeelerDirector, Environmental StrategiesEnronWashington DC office - (202) 4666-9157Cell Phone (203) 464-1541\n"

When can we finalize?From: Aaron Brown/ENRON@enronXgate on 04/24/20001 10:42 AMTo: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, PEGGY FOWLER/ENRON@enronxgatecc: Mary Joyce/ENRON@enronXgate Subject: PGE retention programHere's the updated spreadsheet based on Peggy's email and our understanding of the programs.Peggy, Joyce's reason for requesting an exception for Mary Turina (front loading and increasing retention bonus or guarantee payment of sales bonus) is \"Due to the special nature of the trading floor and the on-going need we have to retain people in this area\"...here's how I see itFactors:(1) seems like Mary just went into that position...but, if she's already established a reputation and is being heavily recruited, then maybe a higher number on retention is justifiable(2) she works 80% - i know that's not indicative of productivity, but it seems our flexibility should be worth something in the retention bucket(3) she only has about $1000k of unvested equity remaining(4) as currently contemplated, Piro and Lesh would get about $250k (compared to $2000k for Mary) in retention value - but this points back to (2) somewhat and potential internal inequity issues if increased values or exceptions get outThe most important factors are:(5) the risk of losing Mary to a competitor and (6) whether that loss would significantly disrupt the sale process or ongoing operations of PGEIf these factors are, in fact, problems, then it probably makes sense to increase Mary's retention bonus.   If we get into front loading her retention bonus, then I'd want to get some strong non-compete and non-solicitation language in the documents.   The reason for front-loading the retention grants for Fowler/Miller is to provide some consideration/incentive for giving up \"window\" payments.Peggy, if you still feel strongly about increasing Mary's retention bonus after reviewing my thoughts, I don't have a problem with $250k, but if we start to get into the $3000k - $4000k range or front-loading any portion, I'd like to get Stan's sign-off.Aaron---Original Message---From: FOWLER, PEGGY Sent: Monday, April 23, 20001 7:02 PMTo: Brown, Aaron (Executive Comp); Horton, StanleyCc: Joyce, MarySubject: Re: PGE retention programThank you for the summary Aaron, I don't think you misrepresented anything,but there are a couple places that I have questions, or the amounts you showare different than what I was expecting.1)My records showed our last discussion around Lobdell showed his sales bonusat $2225,000. and this shows $250,000. which I am OK with, but if total dollarsare limited, I might need the $25,000. for some other individuals.2) I had emailed before that Quennoz, Johnson, and Ryder were lower than thelast plan, although this was the 'old' retention   plan. I had propposedQuennoz and Johnson going to $250,000., which gets them to previous level, andRyder to $2225,000., and that Barnett would need an increase to keep equity to$2225,000. If $250,000. is too high for Johnson and Quennoz, I could probablybe OK with $2225,000. for each of them, but they should be as high as Nichols,and Barnett should also be as high as Nichols.3)I had also had Joyce Bell ask you a question about Mary Turina, and paymentof sales bonus at earlier of sale or some timeframe like 2 to 3 years.Probably what I'm really suggesting here, is maybe we need to increase herretention, and decrease her sales or something like that, and a front loadingmight work here too, with incentive to have to stay.   Thanks for all your help and work on this Aaron. Please call if you haveproblems understand my notes. 503-464-8401 &lt;&lt;&lt; Brown, Aaron (Executive Comp) 04/23/01 01:14PM &lt;&lt;&lt;Here are the numbers for the PGE retention programs.   Stan, I've reviewed Peggy's recommendations for these programs (Retention andSales Bonus Programs) and they seem reasonable in light of the imminentdivestiture of PGE and our associated needs - let me know if you're ok withthe numbers.Peggy, let me know if I've misrepresented anything.I will be working with Kriste Sullivan (Enron attorney) to implement theseagreements and supercede the prior agreements.   We are hoping to have theagreements signed and executed by May 13.Aaron &lt;&lt; File: PGEretention.xls &lt;&lt; \n"

Over the last month, Diane and I have met several times to transition the Azurix Public Relations function into ETS. Shelley and I also met with John Garrison. As you know, Azurix has a lot of irons in the fire and many of them could turn into public relations challenges. Azurix has PR employees in Buenos Aires, Ontario, and California. These employees were notified by Diane that I was taking over the Azurix PR function and to coordinate their activity through me. I've spoken to a few of the PR employees.To summarize what Azurix might face in the near future, here's what Diane and John provided me and Shelley: ? Offers to purchase Azurix North America are due May 24. John anticipates spending one month reveiwing the offers and making management presentations. As a deal is done and made public, information and responses to the media will be coordinated with Mark Hudson in Ontario. ? The Madera project in California continues. Cole Frates is on the ground in California and I will coordinate with Cole as issues surface. ? Gustavo Pedace is on the ground in Buenos Aires. If I had to guess, this is where Azurix has the most exposure. As July and August approach, we'll know more about the direction of Azurix Buenos Aires. ? As things transpire with the other assets, I'll coordinate PR activity with the contacts on the ground. Mark Palmer and his staff know that ETS is involved in Azurix. I have a phone call into John Shafer to discuss the use of the crisis center in case of an Azurix emergency. This is a precautionary measure that I hope we don't have to use.Please let me know if you would like to discuss Azurix and the PR function further. Gina \n"

They aren't doing anything according to Rodwho checked for me. It seems to me that we need to do several things to eitherkick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale. 1. We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to thetransactions being proposed. I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue.2. We need to determine EBS interest in this business...ie are they a buyer orseller of Portland metro dark fiber. If they want to be in this businesswouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in asale? 3. A project of this size will take Jeff's approval.

We do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business.   In fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices.   Second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices.   Therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit.   That would include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, CO2, etc) as well as fee based processing.   Non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based-type deals 9IE...electric generation).

We're alwaysglad to have you visit, and could provide a detailed discussion if that's whatyou would prefer. We are spending a great deal of time on this in the salespresentations and have a number of overheads, and some written informationthat we use in our position meetings that we could send to you to start with.The rate case is in a very dynamic state, but we believe moving in rightdirection. The power position is in constant review based on projected loads,demand side management opportunities, and blocks of energy available atreasonable prices in the future for our customers. We are still operatingunder an obligation to serve, as we don't see that changing anytime in thenear future and those utilities in the west that have gotten in trouble arethose who haven't provided for customers. Commissions seem to be giving rateincreases for increasing prices if prudent management was attempted, but notjust for stopping based on possible belief of dereg. We have a sharingmechanism right now that shares risks and rewards between customers andshareholders. During this sales process we had spent a lot of time workingthrough with Sierra on this, and now with the new possible buyers. Most likeit when they finally understand. It is not regulation 101, it is very complexand leading edge, but get the risks and rewards aligned much better forshareholdes and customers. Doesn't fit Enron's view of dereg, but Oregon willnot get to Enron's view anytime soon, especially with California situation,and it's not just Oregon regulators, it's Oregon customers including theindustrials that are   reliability sensitive like high techs and health care. Sorry for the long note...how about if I start by sending you someinformation from presentations, and then we can look at schedules for when ameeting might work. You might even want to come to one of the bankerpresentations. Mark M and Mitch were both in Seattle yesterday, and couldshare with you some of the discussion related to these subjects. Mitch thoughtwe might have another in a week or so...   &lt;&lt;&lt; Horton, Stanley 05/08/01 09:37AM &lt;&lt;&lt;After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE businessreview, there are two areas that I think I need to understand better.   Thefirst is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial exposures tochanging prices.   The second is the rate case.   I would be happy to return toPortland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast of players.   Iam open to suggestions from you.Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (andsubsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.Thanks!\n"

      "body": "\nThanks for the report.   The level of detail was on target.   Let me know when you want to discuss comp issues.Adam_Umanoff%ENRON@eott.com on 04/29/20001 12:23:555 PMTo: Stanley_Horton%Enron.com%Eott@EOTT.COMcc:   Subject: EWC - Weekly Update/Week Ending 27 April1.   Aura.   -   Received revised bid from UBS which Metts describes as \"real.\"   UBSwill now commence detailed 6-8 week due diligence on EWC (at Enron'sexpense if deal busts).   Confidence re: UBS' ability to execute remainsmixed.   -   LJM (Fastow) interest continues, but unclear how parallel processcan be run.   Umanoff concerned about conflict when management assistsseller as part of UBS deal but assists buyer as part of LJM deal.   -   Now that '01 numbers scrubbed, in process of revising '02 financialprojections based on detailed internal review (as of December, 2000, '02EBITDA projected at approximately $1115mm; up from 1CE '01 projection of$78mm). This is unrealistic; I expect 20002 EBITDA in the $90-95mm range,showing solid 15-20% EBITDA growth.2.   M&amp;A Activity.   -   acquisition of assets of bankrupt Dutch blade manufacturer, Aerpac,continues; we have closed on several assets and expect final closing inMay.   -   sale of Greek operating projects to German buyer continues, butexecution uncertain.   Closing targeted for June 30.   Sale of Greekdevelopment company also launched, with 2 parties expressing interest.3.   20001 Commercial Activity.   -   US backlog remains firm.   Projected demand continues to exceed ourprojected turbine supply.   Key execution issue is confimation ofsuitability of 1.5 MW turbine (primarily its gearbox) in more rigorous USwind regimes.   -   American Electric Power has provided indicative bid to purchase thetwo Texas projects we have under development (Indian Mesa I and Clear Sky);indicative bid price is attractive.   AEP has requested Enron Corp guarantyof EWC's turbine warranty, like they have received on previous sales withEWC.   Enron Corp guaranty is approved internally, but, in light of Aura,we will continue to bargain for no Enron Corp credit support. Finally, debtfinancing expected to close on IMI in May and debt circled on Clear Sky inJune.   Turbine suitability due diligence is key pacing item for debtclosing.   -   European backlog remains firm, expect for Spanish sales of 750kwturbine, which remains soft. EWC attended Hannover Fair last week, thelargest industrial trade show in Europe.   Our exhibit was very wellreceived.   CEO of German competitor, Enercon, approached Umanoff to discussIP issues (Enercon is currently barred from US market on patentinfringement grounds).4.   HR Issues.   -   US has lost O&amp;M director and 2 key commercial employees haveexpressed concerns.   Need to finalize retention program (Umanoff to discusswith Horton early in week).   -   Key recruiting initiatives are: GM Spain; head of globalprocurement/blade MFG; European GC.   Umanoff would also like to re-visithiring US GM/MD, as day-to-day US operations require more detailedoversight than Umanoff is currently providing; not clear if we can recruitfor this position in the midst of Aura.Stan - for the future, please let me know whether this is the right levelof focus.   Talk with you soon. Adam\n"

Our attorneys commented that the legal fees to accomplish that (when we have a public offering going on) may \"chew up\" the benefits.   But that is their normal reaction - I don't think there will be any problem in accomplishing the placement.   Most likely it will need to be priced simultaneously with the offering to avoid any perceived \"insider\" pricing benefit.   But - do you think that will cause problems internally on the DASH?   The GP contribution will be about $2.5 million.   My concern is RAC will require the $2.5 million GP investment to be combined with the $2 million in LP units, which I believe will trigger Skilling's sign-off.On the FAS 125 idea, we have a structure that has been proposed by SunTrust that I need to review with you and someone in EGF.   I was planning on setting that up after our road show is completed on about 5-17, unless that needs to be accomplished sooner.   Let me know about timing and who you think should be involved (I was going to raise this with Ben Glisan in the next few weeks at his staff meeting).\n"

We both told himthat the best way approach GISB regarding his product was to considermembership and certification if it applied, and to send in a request if hethought that standards should be developed.We also told him that our organization has been very receptive to requestsfor standards development, and have only declined to process a handful ofrequests because they were out of scope.   If he considered that the requestfor standards would improve and streamline the marketplace for natural gas,and that it met both the mission and scope of our organization, it would havea good chance of moving forward.   Our plate right now is pretty full, as italways has been, but that has never stopped a company from requesting thatadditional standards be development.We also told him we would help him to write the request if needed and lookedforwardto working with him in the future.   I am not sure that he will follow up withus on membership, certification or providing a request which would go throughour normal process.   I will keep you updated as or if this progresses.Best Regards, RaeThe GISB mission statement, as adopted by the Board of Directors, is:\"The Gas Industry Standards Board mission is to develop and promote standardsto simplify and expand electronic communications, and to simplify andstreamline business practices which will lead to a seamless marketplace fornatural gas.   These standards will assist the natural gas industry inimproving customer service, enhancing the reliability of natural gas serviceand increasing the competitiveness and efficiency of natural gas markets.\"Scope StatementThe GISB scope statement, as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation, is:\"The objects and purposes of GISB are to propose and adopt voluntarystandards designed to promote more competitive, efficient and reliable gasservice, as such standards apply to electronic data interchange (\"EDI\")record formats, communications protocols and related business practices thatstreamline the transactional processes of the gas industry.\"\n"

They wanted to submit an unsolicited proposal to Enron.   I indicated to the that I would first check to see if Enron would be interested in a venture of this type.   According to these two gentlemen the return on investment is very good, ranging from 15% -   40%.   Would Enron be interested in this type of business?Regards,Henry\n"

Thus, sheer underwriting bulk or equity league table positio=\rn=20\rof a given firm does not necessarily indicate the expected performance of=\r=20\rsuch firm in an NBP offering.=20\r Lead Manager - Salomon Smith Barney\rSSB controls an impressive retail distribution system that has a strong=20\rappetite of MLP offerings.

SSB has served as a co-manager in past NBP offerings and has=\r=20\rperformed well.   Furthermore, due to their comparatively small allocations =\rin=20\rthese deals as a co-manager, we are confident that their system has=20\rsignificant untapped demand for NBP units.\r Joint Lead Manager - UBS Warburg (f/k/a PaineWebber)\rUBS has served a lead manager for the last two NBP offerings that were=20\rconducted via the rapid placement (limited marketing) process, so they are=\r=20\rvery familiar with NBP and provide very good analyst coverage.   While we ar=\re=20\rstill confident that UBS will perform well and place a large number of unit=\rs,=20\rtheir allocations as lead manager in our past deals probably soaked up a=20\rgreat deal of demand for NBP units within their system.   Therefore, rather=\r=20\rthan placing UBS in a situation where they would have to stretch to put awa=\ry=20\ra lead manager allocation, it was deemed prudent to slot them in the joint=\r=20\rlead role.\r Co-Managers\rDain Rauscher and A.G.

With regard to EOTT, we plan to keep the same attention and focus on all of the EOTT initiaitives.   I'm a little bit surprised by your comment that they didn't know because I talked with Dana the day after I announced it at Phil's staff meeting.   Obviously something broke down somewhere and I need to keep that in mind in the future.   Relative to your second concern, I'd be less than honest with you if I told you that I don't have the same concern.   Phil and I discussed this at some length but since his work on the international side was winding down and Hawkins really didn't have anything for him going forward we thought his measurement background and technical knowledge might be a fit here.   Don and I talked to Lohit at some length about the communications and relationship building required for him to be successful in the job and he felt he could handle it.   I plan to stay on top of it.   If I see the communications and/or relationships that are required for this job breaking down, I plan to deal with them quickly through the performance mangement process.   Hope this answers your questions.

When the 27 page retirement letter is sent, that a time table ofwhen items will be in place or transferred   be included. (3-9months or when)   Medical Forms can't be put in now until after you leave.   I wentback to the office to HR and they put   the information in thesystem.   Two weeks after I left I called to see when I would receive thecard (Dr.   offices like to see the card).   I was tolled I wasn'teven in the system.   So I called back to Omaha HR   and they workedto get it in place.   When I went to get a RX   I was not in that systemeither and had to   come home and call HR and start over with thatsystem.   The only part of the funds that are transferred as of this dateis the Cash Balance Plan.   The Savings   Plan and ESOP are nottransferred to my Financial Plan.   They tell me they will be; this is whyI feel   a timeline would be helpful.   Until I received myMedical Card I put off going to the Dr.   Also I haven't   wanted totake a trip because, I am unsure of when funds will be transferred.   Last week I received a letter from a transfer Company out of NY.with (2) shares of   ENRON   stock.   So I called NY to seewhat Fund that was from,   they didn't know they were just to set up a   account.   I called the Enron retirement line and they didn't knowwhat Fund that was from either.   Many of the people who answers the phones about any of this justdon't have answers.ENRON employees have been well taken care of while we are working, thisdoesn't seem like that in retirement.   I share this because I know yourare always working to improve ENRON.Sincerely,Jean Mohring___GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!Juno offers FREE or PREMIUM Internet access for less!Join Juno today!

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants).   Edison \"arranged\" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.   Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.   Their message was simple (and simplistic):El Paso and Dynegy have market power.They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to \"obscene\" levels).That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic.   It's attached.   Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics.Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling.Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of   the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.Best,Jeff\n"

What do you think?Steven J Kean04/26/20001 03:09 PMTo: Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Shelley Corman/Enron@EnronXGatecc: Stanley Horton/Corp/Enron@Enron, Linda Robertson/NA/Enron@ENRON, Ray Alvarez/NA/Enron@ENRON, Tom Briggs/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes---The Other Side of the StoryWe need to communicate with Massey before he gets completely carried away blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes.   We need to get him the information regarding Cal LDCs failure to fill storage and their opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state.   Shelley --- could you forward copies of the LDC filings to the group.   Should Joe or I (or both) try to see massey when I am in town next week?---"

At thesame time FERC's approval of the effort by the 9 NW utilities (IOUs plus BPA)to form RTO West was conditioned on making a 12/1/01 compliance filing thataddresses seams issues with California and Canada, and a timetable forcreating a West-wide RTO. Together, these orders should help preventCalifornia's efforts to balkanize their power system.4)FERC's order on RTO West gave a boost to the inclusion within the RTO of theindependent-for-profit transmission company (TransConnect) proposed by 6 ofthe 9 RTO utilities including PGE. Relying heavily on TransConnect'sindependence, the Commission approved TransConnect's proposal to file forinnovative and incentive rates.5)Wholesale sales continue strong in a robust market.6)Thermal plants are in sequential annual   maintenance outages.7)Hydro plants operations are reduced due to poor water condition in NW.8)Contract negotiations continue with IBEW Local 125. Next meeting isscheduled for May 7.9)Customer Information System installation is approaching 75% completion,being on schedule, and under budget.10)Joint Meter Reading project is on target with 850,000 routes now mergedwith NW Natural Gas.111)SB 11149, Oregon's version of deregulation, is still uncertain in thelegislature. We are ready to implement on whatever timeframe is decided.12)We plan to submit another fast track small microturbine generating plantfor RAROC next week.13)Senator Gordon Smith reception held to keep contact on issues around pricecaps, and there determental effect on energy markets and new generation.   &lt;&lt;&lt; Horton, Stanley 04/23/01 02:57PM &lt;&lt;&lt;I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less)bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each Friday.

Questions mostly around powersupply trading, and risk/reward formula with customers and shareholders, thatis in agreement with OPUC.-California's rolling black-outs have pushed up prices in the West, allowingopportunities for PGE to continue to sell into the market.-All IOUs, State Agencies (OR,ID,WA), Power Councils, BPA, and securitycoordinator met to address emergency preparedness. There is beginning to beheightened concern about Fall and Winter supply.-Union negotiations continued, and progress was made understanding needs andissues. Next meeting scheduled for May 21. Union seems to be in no hurry, andneeds for time to get interests aligned.-De-reg Bill continues to be uncertain. It has become a political football,where legislatures are convinced, who ever carries or doesn't carry forward,depending on future power situation, will determine which party ends up inmajority, and as governor in the state. Politics...ugh-Final contracts should be received tomorrow. Will work to turn them around asquickly as possible, but I know people will need a few days with them, and afew more issues may need to be addressed. There are some employmentagreements, and other contracts that were put in place by others, that havecreated some benefits, that people feel they are giving up with newagreements. Some is perception, some is real, some is lack of trust forEnron's   intent, when things are not written precisely.\n"

Wessexwill provide ED with its I&amp;C database and, should Wessex decide to enterinto the residential power and gas market, ED could provide siteregistration and gas/power price risk management services to sit behind theWessex brand.Given that Wessex is Enron's biggest retail platform in Europe, have yougiven any thought as to how it could be closer integrated with Enron Directgenerally?   Given current market conditions, I expect Enron will havelittle choice but to hold onto Wessex for the time being which isn'tnecessarily a bad thing.There could obviously be some regulatory issues in bringing our retailwater and energy businesses together, though I think it is worth lookingat.   ED has 150,000 I&amp;C customers across the UK, making it a good fit forWessex.   Also, if the Water market opens up to competition in the future,there would be benefits for Wessex.I look forward to discussing ideas with you when you are over in June.Matthew\n"

I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.   Lou,   I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.   As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier   with what I have to offer them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.   After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 days...I will shoot for better than that.   I feel however that this quote/due diligence will be much more intensive on their part   given their experience with EOTT,   I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time frame.   Is 30 days acceptable?   Hope this answers your questions.   If not please let me know.   \n"

Thank you.Stephen.Dyer@bakerbotts.com on 04/26/20001 10:54:38 AMTo: Stanley.Horton@enron.comcc: david.hill@msdw.com, Adam.Schucher@bakerbotts.com Subject: important - something for you to ponder, and then respond pleaseDavid Hill put us in touch with Marco Crespi, who is at Morgan Stanley DeanWitter Trust FSB in New Jersey.   There is no local office of MSDW Trust, andby local I mean in the State of Texas (not just Houston).   Marco assures usthat MSDW Trust has authority to conduct trust business in all 50 states andis sending us evidence of same.   I am not worried about their authority todo trust business here, but I am worried a bit about what I explain below.Marco has informed us that, since MSDW Trust has no local presence, theywill not accept appointments to the more personal or high contact positions,such as agent (attorney-in-fact) under a Statutory Durable Power of Attorneyand executor under a Last Will and Testament.   Basically, all they take atthis point are trustee appointments.This obviously puts a kink in your plans as outlined at our meeting in youroffice on April 3 with David Hill and in our follow-up e-mails.   We haverough drafts of your documents in process and expected to send you somefirst drafts by mid-week next week, but all those drafts name MSDW Trust tothe various positions you had in mind, some of which we now know are notfeasible.If you want to name MSDW Trust as co-trustee on all the trusts, whethercreated now or under your Will, that will work fine.   However, you will notvery well be able to bridge the gap during any period of incapacity (under aPower of Attorney) or during any period of estate administration (under aWill) with another corporate fiduciary as co-agent or co-executor who thenis expected to hand off to MSDW Trust as trustee.   In other words, if youreally want MSDW Trust in there for the long haul as co-trustee on all thetrusts (both now and after your death), your best bet is probably to haveonly an individual serve as agent or executor (say your wife, for example),as those jobs are temporary, to bridge the gap until the trusts are fullyfunded after your estate administration is completed.If you have any reticence about naming only an individual as agent orexecutor (again, say your wife), you might consider having two individualsnamed together as co-agent and co-executor to ameliorate your concerns (sayCaron with your wife?).Of course, if you want to shop around town a bit for a corporate fiduciarywho could and would serve as co-agent and co-executor, we can provide a listof several banks and trust companies and introduce you to most in the city.Baker Botts has no horse in this race other than you and Debbie, of course,and we will not favor MSDW Trust or any other trust company, one overanother.   You favor MSDW, though, and I'd like to help you work out a planthat uses them.Please let me know your thoughts, as I know you are eager to put at leastsome of this to bed soon, and Adam Schucher (here at Baker Botts) hasprepared first drafts that require only my review and revisions prior tosending them to you.   It just looks now like there may be more revisionsthan we originally anticipated.Sorry for the news.   Please advise.   I'll be out today after 111:15 but willbe in tomorrow and next week.SD\n"

We are starting on your drafting work now that we have received theengagement letter.   We have a few questions that need answering, as follows:1. I need David to send me materials on Morgan Stanley Trust Co. sothat we can properly designate the right entity by correct name, etc.   Ifthey have any suggested or required language for our documents, I need tosee that as well.   Finally, I need for David to confirm with MorganStanley's fiduciary people whether Morgan Stanley can serve as a co-agentunder a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney and whether there are anyconstraints or limitations in doing so that would impact our drafting.David can follow-up directly with me if that suits you.2. I want to remind you to send me a photocopy of Caron's \"old\" trustdocument, so that we may consider whether it fits the current plan and canserve as a receptacle under the current plan.   Sending it out today3. We talked about setting up Debbie and MSDW as co-executor andco-trustees under your Will, with Caron as back-up to Debbie in thatposition.   However, we are also going to create a generation-skipping trustright away for Caron.   Who should be the initial trustee(s) of Caron'strust?   Debbie and MSDW?   or Randy and MSDW?   or even Caron and MSDW?   andwho shoud be back-up?   Caron and MSDW 4. You said that Debbie wants to name you as executor and trustee underher will.   Who should be your back-up in those roles?   If Linda Wehring isDebbie's back-up on Debbie's power of attorney, I would suggest that shealso be the back-up executor/trustee, but Debbie may prefer to name Caron.It would be best if Debbie would name at least two successors after you. 1.   Caron 2.   Linda Wehring (alternate) That's it.   Please respond by whatever mode you prefer.   I hopeemail is reasonably satisfactory for purposes of my asking these questions.I tend to start with email because it is so non-obtrusive, but I'm happy todo whatever you prefer.SD\n"
