Steve,

Please, let  me know when you come back.
I have detected a tendency to implement different
approaches to valuation in the past.

To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal 
rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques
which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the 
originators to control the outcomes.
