Shelly,

I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.

Li was scheduled to meet with me last Thursday but  she never showed 
up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up.
I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Vince
