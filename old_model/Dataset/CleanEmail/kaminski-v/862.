Rabi,

You and Tanya  should go ahead with the course you have already registered 
for.
I have just mentioned it  FYI.

I don't see too many problems  with the  course Stinson
may help to arrange. The alternative course can be scheduled on premises, 
late in the day
and distributed over longer  time period.
