Clayton,

We can discuss your request  when I come back to the office on Monday.

Regarding the trip to Portland. Such a trip requires an  explicit prior 
permission from your boss,
myself in his absence, or Stinson in my and Vasant's absence.
In case you did not ask for such a permission before, the request  is denied.
