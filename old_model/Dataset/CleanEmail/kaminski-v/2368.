Dale,

To follow up on my earlier message. Anjam expressed his concern
that Sharad is holding off on our offer. I would consider bumping it up to 
55,000
with a sign-on bonus. We badly need fresh talent.

 I shall be in Australia next week. If you need
any additional intervention from us, please, call Stinson.

Vince
