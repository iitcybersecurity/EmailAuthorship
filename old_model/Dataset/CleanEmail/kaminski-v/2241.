Amy,

I think that Rick Causey wants simply to obtain more information to make a 
reasonable decision.

We should cancel the meeting for the time being and let Rick  obtain 
clarification of some issues from AA. I would agree that AA came up with a 
rather
vague concept of what they want to accomplish.
