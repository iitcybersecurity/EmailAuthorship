Celeste,

I am forwarding you a letter from Prof. Duane Seppi from Carnegie Mellon 
University.
I have known Duane for many years and I know that he does not make his
recommendations without very good reasons.

I would recommend looking at John Gordon as a very strong candidate:
I think he will make a terrific contribution to Enron.
