    Maria, I wanted to follow up after discussions with you and Shelley, th=
e SoCal window is based on what SoCal=20
    is willing to confirm into their system for the day.  It does not neces=
sarily have anything to do with physical capacity at Needles.
    If you have any questions, please let us know.  Thanks.  Lynn
