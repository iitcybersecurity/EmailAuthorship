Thanks for your nice note.  The promotion did get the year off to a nice 
start.  I am glad that you were pleased with the year end PRC process.  While 
time-consuming, I have appreciated the opportunity to get to know Associates 
like you whom I would perhaps otherwise not know.  Keep me posted on what you 
are doing.  --Sally
