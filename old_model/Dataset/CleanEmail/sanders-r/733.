There are two lawsuits against ECT pending in LA dictrict court in 
California.The plaintiffs are Legg Mason and Farrallon. They did not give us 
releases. The other plaintiffs have either given us releases or decided not 
to sue us(the statute of limitations has probably already run as well) I will 
be happy to answer any other questions.
