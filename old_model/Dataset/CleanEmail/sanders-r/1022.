I did not participate in the call last week because I thought it was only 
concerning financial consultants. Shortly before the meeting,a more detailed 
agenda arrived by e-mail(which may be par for the course but I find 
irritating). Please find out 1) what was decided and 2) what is the agenda 
for tues. Thanks
