thanks very much for the info.  certainly makes it interesting.  how's 
things?  

P.S. do you know that edison at the FERC hearing said that it hedged $30MM 
and made a whopping $415 MM!!!  Are they gouging San Diegans?  Are they 
"gaming" the system?  Inquiring minds want to know.  You may want to check in 
with Smutney when Edison made the statement.  There may be nothing to it, but 
it might be interesting to check into.  Is Edison one of those "profiteers" 
who ought to give San Diegans a refund?
