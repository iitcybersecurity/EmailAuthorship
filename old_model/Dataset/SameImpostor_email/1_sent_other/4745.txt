Greetings. Forgive the delays.  The meeting can largely be summarized by the 
CEC presentation.  I'll have Joseph email it to you.  In a nut shell, there's 
more interstate pipeline coming to the California border than there is 
INTRAstate capacity to take it from the California border to the 
consumer/business.  The CEC's forecasts show that things will be tight in 
California.  The thrust of the workshop is that, just like power plants, 
intrastate pipeline capapcity is lagging demand in California and California 
needs to make a concerted effort at revitalizing the in-state gas 
infrastructure and do it quickly.   Hope this is helpful, and again, sorry 
for the delay.

Best,
Jeff
