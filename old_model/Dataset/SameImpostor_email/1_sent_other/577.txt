Harry:  FYI.  First meeting to discuss how to dole out the $50 MM created by 
AB 970 is 10.7.  Someone I've worked with on DG-type deals in the past from 
EES is going to attend the meeting (Brian Smith from the Costa Mesa office).  
Bob Frank and I had a conference call with him this morning.  URL for the 
event is included below.

Best,
Jeff
