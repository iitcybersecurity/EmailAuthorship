FYI.  Any thoughts Joe & Co.? Is release from contracts an "increase supply" 
option?  My fear is that QFs get released and then California's "police 
state" mentality kicks in, enacting Exec Orders, legislation, etc. to ensure 
that the power from the QF facilities stays in California.

Best,
Jeff
