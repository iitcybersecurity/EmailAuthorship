Mike, Jeanne:
Have you heard anything about any relief on penalties that the PUC might have 
recently granted interruptible customers?  (Recall that Loretta has refused 
to allow folks on interruptible to get off those contracts.)  Could you let 
me know as soon as you find something out?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
