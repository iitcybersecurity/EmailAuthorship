Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point 
presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after 
I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's 
in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.

Best,
Jeff
