Dave and I talked.  I've talked to Chris Foster (midmarket in Portland). He's 
sending me 1) illustrative examples of offers we've made to each of the three 
IOUs, 2) deals we've done with the IOUs to date (only one thus far with 
PG&E).  Laird Dyer will get back to me with the muni deals we've thus far 
done (e.g., Roseville.)

Best, 
Jeff
