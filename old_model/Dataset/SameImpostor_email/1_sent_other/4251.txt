FYI.  From our folks in Sacramento:

AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill.  It's not an emergency 
bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and 
summer.
AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be 
"regulated."  Also no an emergency bill.
AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in 
electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.

Best,
Jeff
