Jennifer:

With respect to FERC's ruling from Friday, I'll forward to you what's been 
forwarded to me.  With respect to the governorn's plan, the one that you 
forwarded along from EES' customer is definitely one of the more extreme 
scenarios we've been hearing, but with Davis, I wouldn't rule anything out.  
If I hear anything, I'll report back.

Best,
Jeff
