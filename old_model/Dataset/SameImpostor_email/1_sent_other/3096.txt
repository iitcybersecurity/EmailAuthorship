We should be able to pull it together.  Mike, I don't have any information 
about siting or DSM bills.  Could you please add some very brief bullets to 
your original ones (factual ones rather than advocacy ones) that describe 1) 
what siting reform bills are out there, what they say, what the chances are 
for passing, and what the timing for passage seems to be at this point, and 
2) same info for DSM.  Thanks a bunch.

Jeff
