Jim, et al:
FYI.  Lots of expansion plans going on, including TW.  We can discuss further 
on the call.  Expansions generally create some level of concern from shippers 
due to the fact that capacity to the boarder exceeds takeaway in California.  
It's particularly prickly at Wheeler, through which, I'm assuming, the Kern 
expansion will flow.  We can discuss further on the call.

Best,
Jeff
