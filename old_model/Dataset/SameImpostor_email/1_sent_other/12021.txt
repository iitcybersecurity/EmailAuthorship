Jim, I think that the point of the "flurry" is that we in California ain't 
received anything from PG&E.  Seemed that Wanda, from her note, said that she 
is on top of it.  Can you check in with Tamara and find out what her issues 
are?  Greatly appreciated.  

(From what I heard on the phone last night, sounds like that little girl of 
yours is going to be an opera singer.)

Best,
Jeff
