Greetings.  Lately, my email's been mangling addresses when I reply.  Just 
noticed that I got alot of "couldn't send/big error" messages from the 
answers I emailed out late last nite.  Did anyone get them?  I'm trying 
again.  Please let me know if you get this one.  Thanks, and sorry about the 
mixup.

Best,
Jeff
