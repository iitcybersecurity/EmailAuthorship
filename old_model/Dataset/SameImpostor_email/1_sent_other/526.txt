Lee:  I'm not certain that it will be possible to get Skilling, but I'll get 
back to you soon.  Also, I want to manage expectations a bit about the 
possibility of having Enron stream the conference.  Just don't want us to get 
ahead of ourselves.  I'd prefer that it not go out in any announcement at 
this juncture.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff
