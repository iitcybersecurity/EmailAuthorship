FYI.  New amendments out on DA that Keeley's accepted that I'm faxing to you 
right now.  Also, it's 82XX we're talking about, not 83XX.  83XX is the bill 
that Wright's authoring with the Rs.

Also faxing to you Reliant's "Dear Dunn, Go to Hell, Sincerely, Reliant" 
letter.

Best,
Jeff

Vegas still sez best odds are on Edison going in.
