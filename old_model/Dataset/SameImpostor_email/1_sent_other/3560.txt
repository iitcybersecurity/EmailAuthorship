Scott/Hedy/Mike:
What's the status of the DG bill?  As I recall, Burton amended the bill in a 
way that explicitly prohibit diesel DG units from helping California avoid 
rolling black outs this summer. I believe the exclusion was made on grounds 
that running diesel would be too environmentally damaging?  Could you provide 
a brief update?  Is there anything in the bills that addresses the 
restrictions on the number of hours that these units are permitted to run?  
Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
