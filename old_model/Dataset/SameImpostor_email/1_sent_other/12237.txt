Thanks, Mike.

I prefer the $15,000/clean slate option.  For comments on the proposed 
decision and lobbying on this specific case, I'm willing to go straight 
hourly basis, but I will continue to request fixed prices going foward.  And 
worry not, it's not a Rick, Paul, Steffes issue.  I'm the headache.

All this said, and budget haggling aside, I'm sure you're aware that it's my 
view that 1) you do fantastic work and 2) it's great to work with you.

Best,
Jeff
