You're kidding.  You mean they've double billed us?  Can you find you're 
credit card bill?  They can find each and every receipt, who signed it, etc., 
so that we can make sure they don't screw us.  I'll bring my stuff over 
tonite.  If they've double billed us, I'm going to suggest that they owe us a 
comp up there.   No worries, though.  They've got the paper work, and if 
we've paid twice, they're just going to need to credit my card.  No big 
deal.  Just a hassle having to deal with 'em.  You around tonite?
