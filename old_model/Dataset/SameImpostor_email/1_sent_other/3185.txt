Thanks.  I'll take 12 magnums.  And please order 2 cases of Coastal zin.  I 
think that we'll likely come by either before or after the dome trip this 
weekend.  I can pay you then.  

I'm not looking to make money on the grapes.  Just looking for someone to 
finance the development of my land.  And I'd have a vineyard to look at all 
the time!  That'd be enough for me.  Thanks for all your help.
