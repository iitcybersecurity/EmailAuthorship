Sandi's on vacation this week.  There are rumors that PG&E's actively seeking 
a negotiated solution with legislators and the Governor, but I can't verify 
and don't have details on what the negotiated agreement might look like.  
While's Sandi's away, have asked Mona to check in with our Sacramento 
lobbyists to poke around for information.  Will report back soon as we get 
more info.
