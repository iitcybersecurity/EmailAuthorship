Hi Dale:

Please call me to discuss your question.  (415.782.7822)  Customers could try 
to "bypass" the utility, but until Dec. '95 (PUC final policy decision) and 
AB 1890, it was against the law to have direct access, so you may be 
misinterpreting the yellow book just a bit.  There were other forms of 
"bypass" at that time, but DA as we think of it today was illegal.  Give me a 
call and we can try to clear things up (specific references to where in the 
YB you're getting this impression will be helpful).    Glad to talk to you on 
Friday and be happy to talk more if you have any other questions, or desire 
any follow up.  

Best,
Jeff
