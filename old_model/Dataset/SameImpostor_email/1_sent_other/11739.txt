Let's discuss further, but I believe that the tariff would be a "generic" one 
for network service, with the price, terms and conditions dependent upon the 
size and other attributes of the customer.  Not aware of any negotiated rates 
available from the US/Mex border to the burner tip in S.D.

Best,
