Thanks, Hedy. Barring any strange turn of events, we're likely to be OK with 
the language.  The budget--and the R's desire to mess with Davis--appear to 
be delaying things somewhat.  If tomorrow Loretta holds the DA decision till 
the 12th, that will buy some additional  (and necessary) time to work a deal. 

Best,
Jeff
