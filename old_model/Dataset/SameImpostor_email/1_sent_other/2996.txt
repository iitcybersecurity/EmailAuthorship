The way we handled it last time was 1) have a quick chat about it, 2) split 
up the pieces, 3) once written, pass around the pieces to see if anyone has 
any strong feelings about what folks had pulled together, and then, for each 
case, 4) designate one person as the "assembler" of the pieces.  (We 
designated who would be responsible for which cases at the beginning of the 
semester.)  And yes, all by email (save for, say, the preliminary chat).  It 
worked well.  But I'm flexible, if folks want to try another angle.

Best,
Jeff
