Harry, I'll be on the call and I'll call you beforehand.  Mike Day has every 
financial incentive for us to have a witness, and I'm still struggling to 
find the value.  As for the "save the planet" crew....I'm as concerned as you 
are.  I'll try to make sure that Kaufman's on (who's a lawyer and is 
considerably more to our thinking than to Mike's, Roger's or Stoness'.

Best,
Jeff
