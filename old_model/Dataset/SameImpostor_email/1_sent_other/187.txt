As you know, I have great interest.  However, I've checked flight schedules 
to come out Tuesday night, and to put it mildly, it's very ugly.  Seems like 
alot to arrive in D.C. around 3 AM only to turn around and head back to the 
left coast the next day at 3-4 PM.  But I think the meeting should go ahead 
and take place anyway.  Is there any chance that Lisa could get a phone in 
your meeting room so that I could participate by conference call?  Sorry for 
the headache.  Let me know.  Thanks again for the chat this PM.

Best,
Jeff
