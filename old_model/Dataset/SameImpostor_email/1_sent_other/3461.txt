Bill:  In order to assess, I need to understand the structure.  What's the 
contract structure look like now?  What are we proposed to change, including 
counterparties?  What part of the existing contract required any PUC approval 
and why?  What is Edison saying needs to happen at the PUC?

Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
