If there is a deal shaping up, it's happening by and large through the 
auspices of IEP.  We've thus far decided to maintain an arm's length 
relationship with IEP, choosing not to get too close to the generators.  If 
we want to influence any deal they cut, we'll need to assess how closely 
aligned/associated with them we want to be.  Further we distance ourselves, 
less likely we'll be cut in.  

That said, Sue and I have been participating in IEP's (interminable) 
conference calls and actively weighing in to influence what they do.  There 
was considerable discussion on the last call about developing some sort of 
"price cap" proposal that could form the basis of a deal, but no discussion 
whatsoever regarding refunds of any kind.  There were differences of opinion
