Lisa:  Sorry, but Joseph's gone on vacation for the week.  I think that the 
size of the group is going to require that we do this offsite.  We use the 
"Park Hyatt" in San Francisco.  Could you check with Paul and let him know 
that I think that we need to go offsite, given the size of the crowd, and if 
he agrees, could you go ahead and check into getting a room at the Park 
Hyatt?  As always, I'm greatly indebted.  If there are any problems, or if 
you have any questions, don't hesitate to give me a call.

Best,
Jeff
