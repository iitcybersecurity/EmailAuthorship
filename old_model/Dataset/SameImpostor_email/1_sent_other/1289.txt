Sounds very good.  

Might be useful to get a "reputable" economist to write a paper that 1) 
describes traditional means for defining, identifying and mitigating market 
power, 2) compares those with the "new" means folks are coming up with these 
days,  and 3) comments on the "split" in the academic community over the 
issues.  

When Steve Kean and I discussed the notion initially, thought it might be a 
good idea to gently "pile on" to the public discussion with the goal of 
making clear 1) just how complex this issue is and 2) how important it will 
be to have a thorough analysis (say, about 12+ months worth?) before rushing 
to judgment on anything Joskow might allege in his paper.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
