There's a place for working and re-working.  There's also a a very important 
place in art--writing in particular--for spontaneity and whim.  I'd do a 
tweak here and a snip there, but quickly and only around the edges, and 
submit it as a film review.  It's novel, it's fun, and exposure'd a good 
thing.

Things are good.  Going to be weary for the next 3-4 weeks until schools out, 
though.

Best,
Jeff
