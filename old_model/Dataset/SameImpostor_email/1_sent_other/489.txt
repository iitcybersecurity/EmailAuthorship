I was worried about this.  Sent it Monday night.  Kept getting bounced back.  
Could you page me at 888.916.7184 and let me know that you get it?  I'm in 
Portland.  Also, got Ginger's message re: paragraph on TW deal.  Steffes said 
you didnt' need right away because EBR got cancelled.  When do you need and 
do you want just background, or valuation calculations, too? Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
