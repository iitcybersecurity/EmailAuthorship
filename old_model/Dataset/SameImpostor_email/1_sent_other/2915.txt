I agree with Harry.  In particular, we'll need to make Richard Sanders and 
ENA's outside counsel are aware.  I have been concerned, and continued to be 
concerned about, the implications of being in the case, understanding that 
our interests--and the stakes--are very high.  Continues to seem important 
that we be in, but we'll need to discuss further, and make sure that Jim and 
ENA's attorney's are in the loop.

Best,
Jeff
