Sounds good.  You can reach me at 415.782.7822.  Because my schedule is a 
mess (thanks to the mess California has created), if you don't reach me on my 
office line, please try 415.505.6633.  Also, I think that it would be very 
useful to have Leslie Lawner on, since she's involved a lot in California gas 
matters, but it's your call.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
