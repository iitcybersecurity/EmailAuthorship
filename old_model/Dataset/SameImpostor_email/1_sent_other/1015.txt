Can't thank you enough.  Great report and I wish that I'd been there with you 
to experience it.  I'd like to stay in touch.  It's a high priority of mine 
to come down there (as I've mentioned a few times).  I'm going to try and do 
it before the month's out.  I hope we can have lunch or something and compare 
notes about all this stuff.  This won't be going away for quite some time.

Thanks again for your help.

Best,
Jeff
