Jennifer:
I'm on a call with Delainey that just got convened, which means that I might 
be delayed till 11:45.  Unfortunately, Harry's on vacation.  I'll call in 
just as soon as I get done with Delainey.  Also, I was on a call with Eric 
yesterday, during which I went over the S.D. legislation, so he should be 
fairly up to speed.  I'll get on just as soon as I can.

Best,
Jeff
