Thanks, Hedy:

Not good. John White has a similar view, i.e., Loretta doesn't have many 
choices given that the Legislature hasn't executed.  John did say, however, 
that if we can provide the legal analysis to support doing something other 
than "suspend," Loretta is likely to be amenable.  Seems like it would be 
useful to try to get the analysis, assuming that  there's legal analysis to 
support an alternative to "suspend."  

Hertzberg and I are trading calls.  Will report back as soon as I hear 
anything.

Best,
Jeff
