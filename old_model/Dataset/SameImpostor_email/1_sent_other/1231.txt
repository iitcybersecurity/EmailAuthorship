Greetings.  I have a conflict in the morning, but could join by conference 
calling beginning at 2 pm.  Is that possible.  If not, no big deal.  I, like 
Ralph, will catch up at the next meeting, and submit our ideas to Eve between 
now and then.  Let me know.  And I agree with Ralph re: staying focused on 
the most urgent issues.

Best,
Jeff
