Greetings All:

First, I am apologizing in advance for any typos in this email.  Schedule i=
s=20
very tight, but I wanted to make sure that everyone had it first thing this=
=20
morning, with some back-up info that I've included below.

Attached is the email that was sent to Ken Lay's office yesterday evening f=
or=20
delivery to Sen. Brulte.  It's of course confidential.  Few points:

I don't have Bev's email, so if you could please forward to her, that would=
=20
be appreciated.
As we discussed (Jim, Mike, Bev, Scott, Hedy) on our lengthy call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that the plan is still to "wallpaper" Sacramento wi=
th=20
our proposed legislation.
This email does not contain the legislation.  Mike sent the "final" version=
s=20
of our legislation out yesterday, except for the siting piece, which I=20
believe Brian Cragg of Mike's office is finalizing today.
You'll note that we promise Senator Brulte in the email that we'll deliver =
to=20
his office today the proposed legislation.  Again, based on our call on=20
Wednesday, I'm assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed=
=20
legislation to the rest of the world at the same time.
When we spoke on Wednesday, we decided that the Sacramento team would=20
determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same=
=20
time that we deliver the Senator Brulte. I'm assuming that you folks will=
=20
handle that end of things.  Please let us know at your convenience to whom=
=20
you've decided to circulate.
This email does, however, include a "summary" of our proposed legislation. =
=20
But I'm not certain that the summary included in this email is the=20
appropriate language to distribute "to the world," or if we'll need instead=
=20
to tailor some new language.  I think we all agreed that we need a "one=20
pager" to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the=
=20
package effectively.
We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our=20
proposals.  We didn't finalize that plan.  Perhaps the Sacramento team coul=
d=20
propose a plan to do that.  Perhaps we could start with our friends in the=
=20
Direct Access coalition?
We also talked about the need at this point to engage in PR and to get the =
PR=20
machinery activated, also with the goal of effectively communicating our=20
legislative package/message.  We're in a meeting with folks today where we=
=20
can discuss getting that side of things going and Karen Denne has contacted=
=20
Marathon and they're pondering some things that we can do in the near term.
You'll note that there's a considerable amount of information about the DWR=
=20
credit issue.  As I recollect, we discussed the issue in depth on the call.=
 =20
You note that attached to the email is a "legislative fix" to AB1X that cou=
ld=20
solve the credit issue and an attached set of "taking points" related to a=
=20
second alternative to solving the credit issue:  a PUC order clarifying tha=
t=20
DWR will get its money for power purchase costs.
Note also that Steve Kean reminded me that we've got to continue to push to=
=20
get the utilities out of the merchant function.  Accordingly, I've put a=20
brief paragraph on that issue in the note to Brulte in the last section=20
(legislative solution) under the topic "create a real competitive retail=20
market in California."  To the best of my knowledge, we don't have=20
legislative language on that piece yet, and it seems that we'll need to=20
discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so.


If you have any questions about any of the materials in the email, please=
=20
don't hesitate to contact me or Jim or Sandi to discuss.  I can be best=20
reached to day by pager at 888.916.7184. =20

Thanks to all for helping pull this together.

Best,
Jeff
