Carolyn:

I wanted to apologize for the way the group dynamic has shaped up.  It's 
clear to me that you're a bit frustrated, and if I've contributed, I 
apologize.  

You've done the most work on this project, your contribution has been very 
significant, and I personally am not satisfied about the way that the stuff 
you've pulled together (and your views) have been included.  At some point, 
though, it gets tough beating one's head against the wall.  Seems to me that,
