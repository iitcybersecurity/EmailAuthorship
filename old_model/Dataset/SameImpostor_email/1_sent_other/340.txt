Hi Dana:

Please accept my apologies for not having responded sooner.  Things, as you 
know, are, well, a little nuts.  It was great to meet you and I would be 
happy to discuss opportunities.  I need to be in S.D. in the next few weeks.  
Perhaps we could have lunch, or something, and you could fill me in on what 
you folks do.

Best,
Jeff
