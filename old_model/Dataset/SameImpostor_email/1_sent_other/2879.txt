FYI.  Today Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel, publicly opposed the "state 
takeover" plan released by California's Treasurer last Friday, saying,  "I'm 
not a great fan of government getting involved in the private sector, 
especially delivering a key commodity to the private sector."

Might be a good opportunity to try in earnest to enlist Silicon Valley in our 
efforts to get California moving in the right direction, despite itself.

Barrett said the answer is easing siting rules in order to get more power on 
line sooner and blamed officials who've opposed power plants for seriously 
exacerbating the problems in California.

Because of CA' power woes, Barrett said that he'd build new facilities 
anywhere but in California.
