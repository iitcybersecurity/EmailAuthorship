Please keep this confidential at this point.  It's the agenda for the 
California "subcommittee" meeting on Tuesday that I mentioned in an earlier 
note.  They were unable to reschedule the meeting, which starts at 10 AM 
tomorrow, but we're on the subcommitte and  will have very good access to the 
final product, so I'm not too concerned about missing the "kickoff" meeting.  
Folks in California are really looking to us to help figure out item #2 
"forward contracting."  It would be very useful to discuss this outline 
tomorrow while we're all together.

Best,
Jeff
