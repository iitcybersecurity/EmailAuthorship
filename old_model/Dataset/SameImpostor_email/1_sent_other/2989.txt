I don't envy your position.  At some point, the document must be finished and 
folks need to determine whether they'll sign or not.  I greatly admire Rich 
Gilbert, but his comments (re: regulatory intervention is a good thing, and 
now this one) will surely create considerably controversy and could greatly 
upset the apple cart altogether.

Best of luck,
Jeff

Talked to Tyson.  She's really working it, which is great, and I continue to 
focus my efforts there.  My company is squarely behind her efforts.  Thanks 
again for organizing the meeting last weekend.
