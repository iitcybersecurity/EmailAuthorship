Greetings and Happy New Year to you both.

Eve:  Has the sub-group met since things were put on hold a few weeks ago?  
If so, I'm very interested in hearing about what's going on.  If the group is 
going to meet between now and the 16th, I'm also very interested in 
participating in those meetings.  Delaney, I'll be attending the meeting on 
the 16th.  The Angelides proposal has certainly spiced things up--just what 
we need, more David Freeman.......

Best to you and yours in the New Year.
Jeff
