Oh come on.  I heard that you're a ghost writer for Harvey's proposal!  

Kidding.  

Seriously, it's been great discussing these issues on panels with you 
lately.  I have a picture of the two of us from the Berkeley conference I'll 
pass along to you.  

I really think there's a way out of all this without dropping a nuclear bomb 
on all of the hard work folks have done thus far to restructure the 
industry.  Look forward to working on it.

Best,
Jeff

P.S. Don't have TOO much fun dangling the initiative in front of the likes of 
Peace and the IOUs.
