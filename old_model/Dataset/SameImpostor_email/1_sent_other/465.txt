Hi Christine:

Yes, forwarded the email you sent last week.  Here's where folks came out.  
First, we think that the folks in your first group are mean.  Second, it's a 
real challenge managing a group of four and there's concern that five will 
break the camel's back.  Suggestion came up that it might be much more 
mangageable if you could try to link up with a smaller group first.  If 
there's a problem finding a smaller group, then we could try to do five and 
hope the ship don't sink?

Sound reasonable?  

Best,
Jeff
