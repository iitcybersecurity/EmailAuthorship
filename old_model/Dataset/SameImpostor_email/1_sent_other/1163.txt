Hmmmm, I think you're right.  Looks like the more we can get done tonite, the 
better.  Perhaps, if we can wrap the analysis up this evening, we can do some 
serious divvying up of assigments at the end of the meeting.  Then folks can 
go off and complete the assignments between now and Sunday, which should make 
Sunday's activities pretty light.  That make any sense?

Best,
Jeff
