Thanks, Mike.  Given time constraints, might be more efficient if we agree 
internally prior to sending out to the coalition.  Could folks please provide 
any comments to Mike Day pronto so that Scott Govenar can start immediately 
to get the DA coalition on board?  Scott, could you hold off until Mike gets 
and incorporates any internal comments?  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
