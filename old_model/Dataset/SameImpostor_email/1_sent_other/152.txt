Jeff/Drew:

Been out all day.  Will get a copy.  I believe that Jeff's suspicions are 
dead on.  Given all the investigations regarding electricity "price spikes" 
in California, seems very likely that Edison feels the timing is right to 
push the gas issue.  Will confirm that it is targeted solely at El Paso and 
get back to you either way.  If there's anything else, just holler. Will keep 
you apprised of events as they occur.

Best,
Jeff
