Yes.  You can expect it this weekend.  My apologies for being tardy.  Also, I 
think you should make a stab at getting Mike Kahn, Chair of the California 
Electricity Oversight Board on one of the panels.  I can make a contact and I 
don't think that it's too late to try.  He'd be very good.  Very close to the 
governor.
