Guess I was lazier still.  Agree with your assessment, I just neglected to 
recalc your model in order to determine growth rates necessary to get cash 
flows high enough to justify $14 and $28.  31% and 40% growth rates are (I 
would argue) wildly unrealistic.  In addition, the capex numbers would 
(presumably) have to bump up substantially in order to get you there.  
Therefore, I would argue in the memo that the numbers don't add up for a $28 
price (though "irrational exuberance" may permit Netscape to pull it off).  
Unless other folks have comments on the model, I think you're good to go for 
the memo.  Am ready to look at it when you've got a draft.  Great job on the 
case.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
