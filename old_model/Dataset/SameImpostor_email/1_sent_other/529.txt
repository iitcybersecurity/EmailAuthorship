FYI. Great news.  PUC "fixed" the language glitches in the original decision 
granting ETI its certificate and voted it out yesterday.  So we're good to go 
on filing our final tariff.  It's attached.  Please take a look and let's 
discuss ASAP (Monday?) so we can get if on file at the CPUC.

Best,
Jeff
