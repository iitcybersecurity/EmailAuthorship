Been on two panels in the last two weeks with Florio--most recent yesterday. 
Dan Richard of PG&E was also on yesterday's panel.  Mike has now come so far 
as to push the "core/noncore" split a la the gas industy publicly (if you 
just wait long enough, people come around).  Dan Richard did not object.  I 
am pretty suspect about PG&E, though.  Dan Richard said things like:

I'm one of the people in my company who believes that, over time, the utility 
should exit the procurement function, but many policy makers want PG&E to act 
as a "quasi-governmental" body offering reliable, low cost service to small 
customers.
I don't think anyone wants anyone's mother to be thrown to the competitive 
market willy nilly.
People have to understand that the large customers are going to take all of 
the "good" power, leaving the "dregs" for small customers.

While I'm skeptical of PG&E--Dan said what he knew people wanted to hear but 
there was little conviction behind the words--there is certainly an opening 
that we should try to exploit.

In addition, Florio is now publicly agreeing pretty strongly that the gas 
model for utility procurement is one that merits a heck-of-a-lot of 
attention, i.e., set a benchmark, get the CPUC out of the way, and let the 
utility live or die by the benchmark.

There's daylight among the stakeholders, but a very large amount of 
uncertaintly regarding whether the administration, its appointees, and/or the 
Legislature will get on board.

Best,
Jeff
