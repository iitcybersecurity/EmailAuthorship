Thanks, Jeanne:

Couple of thoughts.

1) If California wants to get out of this crisis, it's critical that DWR be 
creditworthy.  Bilas' proposal helps in that regard.  We've been thinking 
pretty hard about the issue and working with DWR to try to fix 
creditworthiness concerns.  Christian, it might make sense to put together 
some comments supporting Bilas' approach and perhaps give him some additional 
recommendations about what the PUC needs to do to get DWR creditworthy? If 
so, (see note below), we have an opportunity to provide those comments to the 
PUC by this Friday.

2) Scott Govenar--on the direct access piece.  Seems like it would be very 
useful to get the DA coalition we're working with in Sacramento to jointly 
file some comments on Friday in response to the Bilas proposal supporting a 
ban on any PUC action on the DA prohibition since the Legislature is still 
working on it.  What are your thoughts?  And if you and the rest of the 
Sacramento team agree, can we work with Jeanne to get some (brief) language 
put together and work to get the rest of the coalition to sign on.  
Alternatively, we could work to get the other folks file individually.  Your 
thoughts on both approaches is appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
