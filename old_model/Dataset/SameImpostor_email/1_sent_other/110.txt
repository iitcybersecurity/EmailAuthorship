Beware the booming B2Bs. 
Several business-to-business stocks rocketed upward Wednesday on little news 
as the Nasdaq waffled for most of the day. While some market watchers said 
investors were betting on a strong quarter, many analysts couldn't explain 
increases of 15% or more in stocks like Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq), Ventro 
(VNTR:Nasdaq), PurchasePro.com (PPRO:Nasdaq) and Clarus (CLRS:Nasdaq). 

Big Day for B2B
Several of the stocks rallied Wednesday on little news.
