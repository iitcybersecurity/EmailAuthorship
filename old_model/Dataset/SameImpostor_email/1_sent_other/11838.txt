It's going to be extremely difficult for anyone who has consumed electricity 
to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to 
exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's 
customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on 
the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just 
want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get 
an amendment here.

Best,
Jeff
