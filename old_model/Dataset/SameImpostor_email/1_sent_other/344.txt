Thank you.  FYI.  Seems that the problem was that the last letter in my IZIO 
login (that comes up automatically when pulling up the page) was being 
truncated (which may result from my regular work login pre-empting the IZIO 
login--the two are exactly the same, except that my work login truncates the 
last letter of my name).  Thanks very much for your help.
