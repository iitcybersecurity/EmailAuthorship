Thanks for the update.  Just want to add that 1) if we're uneasy about 
wearing the full requirements risk, then focusing on offering a purely 
wholesale deal can still be very attractive, given SDG&E's blunders w.r.t. 
procurment wholesale power on behalf of its customers.  And 2) the CPUC has 
been beat up pretty well for tying the IOUs hands in attempting to hedge, so 
they'll be subject to a considerable amount of pressure to pre-approve if a 
deal is offered that can be show to shield San Diegans from volatility and 
that looks"attractive." 

Appreciate being kept in the loop on the details.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
