The haircut notion, I believe, arises from Edison's claim that the PX price 
includes a capacity payment, particularly when demand (i.e., the price) is 
higher.  I think there's discussion of it in the proposed decision that came 
out some time ago and which sits in "hold" limbo on the Commission's agenda.  
I've attached it.  Alan could you see if it's included in the decision?  If 
not, I can poke around more.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
