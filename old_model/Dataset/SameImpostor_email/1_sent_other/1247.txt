thanks.  my assumption is that, with respect to power plant siting and what 
we ought to do, you'll take the lead tomorrow.  does it make sense for now to 
leave a "placeholder' under that one and we can discuss further tomorrow, or 
would you prefer to put a specific item in there now, like "Legislature 
should revisit last session's streamlining bill?"
