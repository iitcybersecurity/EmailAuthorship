This is material that I received re: Nord Pool from Davies (one of 
Schroeder's guys).  If you want to take a wack at putting together a few 
bullets on what Nord Pool is, how it differs from Cal model and why it's 
preferable, that would help me immensely and free me up to focus on 1) 
comments to Gov's proposal and 2) more detail on demand buy-down.  That 
possible?  Let me know.  Greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
