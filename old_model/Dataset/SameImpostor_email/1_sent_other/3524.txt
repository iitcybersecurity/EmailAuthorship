Also might add that it conflicts directly with and is likely to thwart Gov's 
efforts to dramatically reduce demand this summer and avoid rolling black 
outs.  Seems like legislators would benefit from more information, along the 
lines of the points that Harry makes, to better understand that this bill 
would only add to the problems.

Best,
