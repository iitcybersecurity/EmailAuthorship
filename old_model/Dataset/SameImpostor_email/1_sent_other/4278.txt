Greetings all:
I'l have the financials and any other comments/suggestions done and sent to 
all this evening.  I have a conference call at 7 am tomorrow.  Apologies.  
But I think it's very important that we get together one last time to ensure 
that we're all on the same page, that folks understand clearly what slides 
they're responsible for presenting, etc.  What about lunch tomorrow (we're 
all in the city), or at 5 PM (before the ball game)?  Lemme know.

Best,
Jeff
