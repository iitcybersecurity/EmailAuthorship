I know.  Bummer.  Hey, I'm leaving for Houstong in about 30 minutes.  Could 
you refresh my memory on what I owe you for the coastal and the acacia and 
I'll quickly send you a check right now!  Thanks again for the lobster and 
fun last weekend.  Sorry I didn't get back on Sunday.

I cannot believe the Dolphins.....
