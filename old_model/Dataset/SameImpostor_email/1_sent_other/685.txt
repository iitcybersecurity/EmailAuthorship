Sure makes sense.  One concern.  If they buy up to 80% of load, do we run the 
risk of "stranded cost" problem later down the road when we hit the 
backwardated part of the curve.  Hinges on the term of the contract.  Sort of 
chicken and egg problem.  If the buy for short terms, the prices will be 
high, if they buy for longer terms, the prices will be lower, but the risk of 
stranded cost rises.  Thoughts?
