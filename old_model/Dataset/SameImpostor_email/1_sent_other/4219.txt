Looks good, Scott.  One thing:  I admit I'm not a lawyer, so someone needs to 
show me the precise language in AB 1890 that 1) requires the credit (which, I 
believe was created by the PUC, not the legislature) to be based on market 
and 2) requires DA customers to be indifferent to be from DA suppliers. 

Mike Day:  Do you concur with Scott's interpretation in AB 1890?

Like your arguments, Scott.  Just want to clarify that we're on solid legal 
ground before putting the arguments foreward in a brief and/or protest. 

Best,
Jeff
