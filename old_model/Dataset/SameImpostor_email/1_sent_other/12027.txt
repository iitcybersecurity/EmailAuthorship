Thanks very much.  I'm assuming that Bev is there in her capacity as lobbyist 
for Wild Goose on this one?  

Can you please let me know 1) the outcome of the meeting and 2) any actions 
the group intends to take.  I'm here in Sacramento, have alerted Hedy, told 
her that we're trying to gather more intelligence, and that you and your 
client are attempting to get folks together to mount opposition.  Give me a 
call on my cell phone to fill me in on what the group decides.  

Finally, what information do you have about where generators and other large 
customers groups (i.e., CMTA, the Chamber and CLECA) are on the bill?

Best,
Jeff
