Don't mean to keep the chain of emails going, but given the cameras and the 
grand-standing politicians (who seem to have an abundance of rhetoric and 
capacity for scape-goating, and a paucity of constructive solutions or the 
will necessary to do what needs to be done), seems worth considering the pros 
and cons of throwing anyone in front of any legislative committees.  We may 
decide that the pros outweigh the cons and that there's discernable value 
having our outside counsel speak to the issues of supply and demand in 
California and the West, but seems worth spending 5 or 10 minutes on.

Best,
Jeff
