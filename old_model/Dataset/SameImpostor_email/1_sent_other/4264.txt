I love you very much and of course want to be together, but some things need 
to be worked out because there's too much depression and pain associated with 
those incidents.  They have to stop.  

I have never been embarrassed to be with you.  I'm as proud as can be.  I 
think that's something coming from within you that you need to work on, but 
I'm willing to help.

I don't want to end anything, but we need to fix it, or we'll have have to 
end it.  

I love you and miss you.
