Thanks so much for responding.  This is very strange.  I have no idea what'=
s=20
gone wrong.  I'm attaching the emails that I sent.  Please let me know if y=
ou=20
receive this.  And no need to apologize; appears to be a technical glitch=
=20
somewhere. =20

The most important note (and my reason for concern when I didn't hear back)=
,=20
was the one explaining that I had to miss the second quiz due to biz travel=
=20
and offering alternatives for your consideration.  Finally, are you=20
comfortable with our proposed project?

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn=20
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker=20
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go=
=20
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy, anyway=
? =20

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know. =20

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff
