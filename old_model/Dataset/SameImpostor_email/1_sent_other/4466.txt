Greetings:

Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California 
Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California 
Chamber of Commerce.

Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally 
supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information 
regarding the core/noncore proposal.  We have a meeting set up for Thursday 
morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.  Stewart will bring 
Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.

Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall 
package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.  Though 
he, too, would like more details.  Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former 
Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business
