Let's try this.  Neither of us will say one critical thing of the other.  I 
won't say anything, in jest, or otherwise, and you do the same.  And if 
someone does, the other needs to bring it up. But Prentice, if I say, "that's 
critical" and then I have to have a long argument about the fact that I think 
it is, and you think it isn't, that isn't going to work.  So I'm willing to 
have a complete moratorium, if that's something that you're willing to try, 
too.

I hope you'll going sailing today.  Did I leave my sunglasses in your car?  I 
also left my gym bag in your bathroom, which has my sailing shoes in it.  I'm 
at work.  You can call me here.
