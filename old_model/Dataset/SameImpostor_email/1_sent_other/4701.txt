So far there's Wild Goose, but there in Northern California--have to go 
through the Wheeler bottleneck--so that likely won't hunt.  Lodi's a 
possibility, but it's well inland, unlike the significantly more strategic 
storage assets on the coast.  In addition, Lodi's in the process of selling, 
so there's some uncertainty in the short run.  Bottom line, folks are trying 
to build competitive storage, but it's in the "emerging" phase in a very 
hostile environment.  We should discuss further, though; very interesting 
idea.

Best,
