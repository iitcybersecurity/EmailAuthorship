Haven't received anything.  Sounds like we all agree that it would be a good 
idea to do it.  I'll write the prof an email and ask him to email us the 
file.  My preference (in order to actually learn something--i'm sort of 
thick) is to work on these jointly rather than have one person do it each 
week, but i'm willing to discuss.  others have views on how we ought to write 
'em up?

Best,
Jeff
