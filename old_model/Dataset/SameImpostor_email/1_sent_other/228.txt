I think the answer to #1 is:  as much as possible, but I'm not altogether 
certain--pretty sure that our preference would be to use our own internal 
construction folks as much as possible.  Answer to #2 would be very 
interesting; I don't know the answer, but I'm sure that it's tightly linked 
to the answer to #1.  I think you might want to start with Shelly Corman to 
find the right contact for the pipeline constructions.

I leave for S.D. tonite.  I'll give you updates as the day transpires 
tomorrow.

Best,
Jeff
