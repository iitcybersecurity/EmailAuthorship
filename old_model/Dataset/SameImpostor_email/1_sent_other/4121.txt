FYI:  I listened in on the analyst call.  Bryson made it very clear that, 
under the agreement, Edison would re-assume the procurement role on 12.31.02 
and would "administer" (i.e., takeover) the DWR contracts.  Seems pretty 
clear that the State is actively looking for a strategy to exit the 
procurement role.

Best,
