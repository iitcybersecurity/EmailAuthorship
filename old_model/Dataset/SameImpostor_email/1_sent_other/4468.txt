Marybeth:

My apologies, but Steve's going to be in a meeting with the Governor from 
about 1:30 to 3 PM today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter 
returning to Houston.  Likely best to try to arrange the call for tomorrow, 
if that works with Laura.  I'll check Steve's schedule and forward the 
information to you.

Best,
Jeff
