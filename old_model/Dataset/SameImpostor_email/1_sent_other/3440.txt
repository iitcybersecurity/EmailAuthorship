I understand that there may be a need to give no quarter on this, but given 
the circumstances--i.e., we talk every day and time and resources are 
extremely tight--is it reasonable to temporarily suspend filling this thing 
out for the next 60-90 days?  Lemme know.  

My sister just called and said that the earthquake in Seattle was 7.0.  
That's big.

Best,
Jeff
