Concur with Harry, i.e., continue to take the position that the program 
should be available to all.  When I was in Sacramento last week at a meeting 
of all the players, the utilities argument against including DA customers was 
based on "double dipping," i.e., payments to customers/ESPs for curtailment, 
plus payments to customers/ESPs for the re-sale of power to the ISO resulting 
from the curtailment.

The utilities "double dipping" argument is off base.  As important, the state 
is facing the threat of frequent and severe supply disruptions this summer 
and it needs to take each and every step necessary to try to avoid them.  The 
utility position (apart from being incorrect) seems pretty short-sighted 
given the dire circumstances.  So seems clear that California should include 
both DA and bundled customers in the program.

Best,
Jeff
