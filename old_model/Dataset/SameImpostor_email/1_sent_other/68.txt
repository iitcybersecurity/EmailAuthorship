Howdy:

Just between thee and me, I think this note gets to some of the challenges we 
faced and discussed as part of our "group gropes" over the last several 
months.  With Sue coming back on Tuesday, and in the spirt of our gropes, it 
might be useful to discuss as a group prior to charging ahead.  May even 
result in the same outcome on how to proceed, but a little "process" on the 
front end may go a long way toward keeping things on an even keel.  Anywho, 
just my two cents.  Hope your meetings in Salem went well.

Best,
Jeff
