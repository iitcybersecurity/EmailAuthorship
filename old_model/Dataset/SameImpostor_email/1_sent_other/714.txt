Lara:
I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with 
Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a 
deal with them).   That's a date that I can't change.  I can meet on Nov. 
3rd, or Nov. 7-9.  Hope it's possible to re-arrange

Best,
Jeff
