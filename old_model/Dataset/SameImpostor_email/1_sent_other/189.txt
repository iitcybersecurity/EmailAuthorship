FYI.  Under the settlement with SoCal, PG&E and countless others, Altra was 
going to provide the platform for the (unregulated) secondary markets in 
intrastate storage, capacity and imbalance trading rights.  Altra declined 
and SoCal and PG&E will now look for someone else to provide the service.
