Dear Gang:
I don't know about you folks, but I woke up to over 100 emails from Telecom 
Reports today.  It seems to border on spam at this point.  Is anyone else 
having this experience?  The info is very valuable, but I'm wondering if 
there's a way to get, say, 3 emails a day rather than the 50 or more I'm 
currently receiving.

Wondering if the lights will stay on today,
Jeff
