I doubt that anyone in accounting has it, and I'm not sure to whom in 
accounting to send it.  Suggestions?  I think that Bowen & Co. could likely 
help us out on this first filing.  Also, Sue, regarding NY:  I have a call 
into Bowen but when I called they sounded pretty tied up.  Haven't heard back 
yet.
