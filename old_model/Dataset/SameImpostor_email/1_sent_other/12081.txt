Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the 
Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at 
a minimum.
In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it 
still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will 
keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to 
amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is 
growing.
