Yes, we have been working with them.  Stephanie and I were asked to meet last 
week with the heads of the California Chamber and the California 
Manufacturer's Association, at which we discussed demand buy down, etc. at 
length.  It was a very positive meeting.  

Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program.  And I 
believe that our folks (Jim?) are meeting with Reliant to discuss it further 
in D.C.  

I can fax you a copy of what they're walking around if you don't have it.  
I'll let others chime in, but seems to me that it would be very useful to 
contact him.

Best,
Jeff
