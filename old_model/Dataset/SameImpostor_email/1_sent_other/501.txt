real meaning real acacia.  don't care about labeling.  what would you compare 
to in quality?  seems to me that one can't beat $5/bottle for acacia, non?  
what cheese?  man, you saw a great game.  i was portland for the past couple 
days, saw some of the game yesterday at the airport (plane was delayed).

GO GIANTS!
