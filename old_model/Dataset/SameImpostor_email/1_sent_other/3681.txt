That's the right story.  Only thing I'd be prepared for is the following, 
"OK, Mr. Belden, California's stupid, they did it wrong, and your company 
told them so right at the outset.  Does that give you the right to rob 
California's consumers and businesses blind?"  

Regarding the story with Peace quoted saying "we exported our stranded costs 
out of state."  I recall seeing that story on several occasions.  Karen, do 
we have someone who can do a search (lexis/nexis) and find those articles?  
Shouldn't be too tough.

Best,
Jeff
