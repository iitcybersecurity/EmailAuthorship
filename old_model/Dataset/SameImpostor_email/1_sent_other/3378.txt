Gents:
Here it is.  Please insert directly any proposed edits using 
strike-out-underline.  Need them no later than 10 AM tomorrow in order to 
have incorporated and ready to go for class tomorrow.  Dylan, just go ahead 
and put your operating cash flow nos. in (and any other changes you have) and 
send on back.  All:  recall that we are limited to 4 pages of text.

Best,
Jeff
