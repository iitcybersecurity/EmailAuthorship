Enron will very vigorously support the CS and I would hope that we could get 
as many people as possible to do the same.  Let's face it, California's gas 
industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess 
(despite, and perhaps contrary to, the substantially more narrow reasoning 
offered by the Brattle Group).  The CS is a well-thought-out, well-designed 
program for moving forward; unlike the "interim," which takes two steps 
back.  Can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call 
them and try to get them to show up in support? 

Best,
Jeff
