FYI.  Kahn's heading up the "power plant streamlining" task force.  At 
yesterday's FERC hearing, Mike was put in the position of reading word for 
word a statement by the governor (even had to read it in the first person).  
Awkward to say the least.  And Mike wasn't prepared at all to answer the 
questions he got on the statement from the FERC commissioners, particularly 
from Heber.  "I don't know" came up a lot.
