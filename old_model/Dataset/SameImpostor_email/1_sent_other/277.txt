Needless to say, given the Governor's press release, I'm a little concerned 
about what he might want.  Carl Wood and Loretta Lynch were truly abominable 
at the FERC hearing.  Fortunately, FERC (all 4 Commissioners) really beat up 
on the them.  I'm convinced that FERC feels that they must do something 
between now and November and that if we ever had a chance to get them to be 
bold (understanding that "bold" ain't exactly in Hoecker's play book), now's 
the chance.

Thanks for the giving Heber the straight dope.  He was very gracious 
throughout, but after the panel he (very jokingly) ribbed me pretty well, 
saying, "Jeff, I let you off the hook.  I was going to ask you how in the 
hell you ever let California turn into such a mess."  I told him that we were 
exercising Herculean restraint in not making lengthy "I told you so" 
statements.

Best,
Jeff
