Thanks Cynthia.  

Could you please try the W (since I know that one) and let me know as soon as 
possible?  Greatly appreciated.  

And I'll go ahead on the frequent flyer miles.  I'm assuming that the ticket 
you booked for me (is the one that leaves SF on 8/2 at 9:15 AM and returns 
from NYC on 8/5 at 4:15 EDT)?

Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff
