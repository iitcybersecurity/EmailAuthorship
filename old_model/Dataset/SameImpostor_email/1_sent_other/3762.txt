Seems to me that that's exactly what the letter is saying and represents the 
commitment that we've made to our customers since raising the issue of 
re-sourcing, i.e., they'll pay the cost embedded in the contract, period. No 
more and less. I've assumed that the exposure associated with the 
utility-sourced electricity is substantially lower than the exposure 
associated with the customers remaining DA customers.  Can you verify Mike 
Smith?  Thanks.

Best,
