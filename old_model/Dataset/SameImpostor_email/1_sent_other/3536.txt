The notion that it would have to be a monthly analysis sounds like pure 
Roger, and could likely be correct.  But we need to determine whether we can 
get what we need by doing a "less precise" annual versus a "monthly."  Seems 
that once we've made that call, we direct the scenario and they do it.  
Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
