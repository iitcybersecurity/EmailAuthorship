I think it's fuzzy enough that two good lawyers could give two different 
views--wanted to ensure that all analytic bases are covered.  But I just 
talked to Mike and he and I think, at least preliminarily, that the PUC could 
do this absent legislation.  He's going to do the analysis.  Likely better to 
let Mike go ahead and do the analysis and if we want to get other opinions, 
we can make that decision at that time.

One last thought:  If the PUC could do it, that might be Davis' preference.  
That way, he and his people are in charge.  But it may be difficult 
(impossible) for the Legsilature to resist and Davis may not have the clout 
to get them to back off.
