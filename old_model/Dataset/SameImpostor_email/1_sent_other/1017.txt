Dr. Littlechild.  

I'm very disappointed that our schedules seemed to pass in the night.  I had 
an engagement on Monday night, which regrettably kept me from having dinner 
with the speakers.  And Tuesday I was traveling.  I tried to call the 
Claremont and had a dreadful time trying to leave you a message.  If you 
haven't left the states yet, I would very much like to get together.  
Otherwise, I'll just have to come to London.  I understand that David Teece 
has filled you in on our discussions.  Would like to discuss that futher with 
you.  It was a great pleasure to meet you, however briefly, and I hope that 
our paths cross again very soon.

All the best,
Jeff
