FYI.  Bill Gang of EES Federal Solutions has been working actively with the 
Air Force in California.  I've participated in weekly calls with them in the 
effort to get them energized about DA.  Turns out they're precluded by law 
from lobbying.  But they seem to have other ways of being influential.  I've 
put Scott Govenar in contact with them and he's keeping them in the DA 
Coalition loop.  Bill/Scott is this guy familiar to you?  Bill any 
suggestions on how we might best target them in our efforts to get groups 
energized?  Bill:  Perhaps you could phone Janel Guerrero directly to 
discuss?  Her number is:  713.853.9104 (is that right Janel)?

Best,
Jeff
