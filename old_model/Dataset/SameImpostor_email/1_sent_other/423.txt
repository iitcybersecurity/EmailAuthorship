Christine:

My apologies.  My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.  Here's 
where folks came out.  There's some concern about size.  We're supposed to be 
no larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Ok'd our 
"oversized" group.  The other folks in the group--who talked to him 
originally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules.  Folks wondered 
if there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up
