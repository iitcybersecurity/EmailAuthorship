Rick:

My apologies.  The family events here in Mexico have conflicted with the 
calls.  But I will be on the call tomorrow.  (Anything to save $25!)  

One thing. I'm not sure that I can dial into an 800 number here in Mexico.  
Ginger:  Could I possibly call you at 4:30 and have you conference me in to 
the 800 number?

Best,
Jeff
