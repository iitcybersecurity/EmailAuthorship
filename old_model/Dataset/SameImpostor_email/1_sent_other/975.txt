Thanks Harry.  This is important and we've discussed making sure that Neil 
and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that 
includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I 
suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. 
that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal 
issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing 
something, please let me know.  Thoughts?
