OK, given the Enron Xmas party in Houston, and Sue's request that weekends be 
included in the ballot, please repond to the dates listed below.  Please give 
1) your top 3 preferences, and 2) any days for which you have a (true) 
conflict.  Thanks.  Also, unless I hear otherwise, we'll assume that partners 
and children come included.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
