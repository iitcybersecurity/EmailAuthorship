Just to add:  Evie represents (largely) the oil companies.  She represented 
that the suppliers that she represents are negotiating the terms of the 
agreement with PG&E. She finished by saying that she was fairly confident 
that those negotiations would result in the gas suppliers that she represents 
signing PG&E's agreement and supplying gas under those agreements. 

Best,
