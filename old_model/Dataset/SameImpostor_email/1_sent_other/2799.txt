Scott:
Thanks very much for the comments.  On the demand buy-down, I should have 
mentioned that I got a late call from the Gov's office asking for more detail 
on that proposal, which we'll likely forward along tomorrow morning, with the 
comments on the Gov's proposals.  Will try to work the other comments in.  
Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff
