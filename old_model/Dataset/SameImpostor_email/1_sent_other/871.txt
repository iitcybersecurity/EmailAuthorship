Wayne:  If you insist, we can pass on Thanksgiving.  

Others:  Any problems with changing the meeting to Thursdays?  If the 
meetings are going to continue on a weekly basis, I'd like to try to attend 
in person as much as possible (i.e., schedule permitting).  Currently, my 
schedule doesn't permit me to be in Houstons on Wednesday mornings.  But 
Thursdays would work.  If it makes things too complicated, not a problem.

Best,
Jeff
