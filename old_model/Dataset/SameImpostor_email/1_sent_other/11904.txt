No intent to make people pay twice.  Anticipated that Edison might not want 
to be at risk for costs associated with retail gen service (e.g., AS, GMC, 
shaping) while only allowed to charge the wholesale price.  Any changes 
necessary to ensure no double counting are welcome.

Also, if 30 days seems to short to for some customers do strike a deal with 
either the utility or an ESP, then it might be appropriate, and I wouldn't 
object, to extending it to 90 days.  In my conversation with Dorothy, both 30 
and 90 came up.  90 is reasonable, but it would seem to be the uppermost  
limit.

Thanks very much for the comments.

Best,
Jeff
