You need to worry less about Cameron, because I think that it's one of those 
very deeply rooted Mom/daughter things, and will take time to work out.  

And I sense a phase that she's going through that is just like the one that 
my older sister went through with my Mom around the same age (which I wasn't 
particularly happy about, but I think it's normal, sort of).  I'd be happy to 
talk about it if you want some time.  

I think part of it is going to be that primordial thing where she's starting 
her own gig with Scott and it's going to be like a second "breaking away" 
(the one that comes after teen-age-dom).  So it's less about you and much 
more about her (and Scott, to some degree, too).  

I hope I'm not confusing matters more.   

Hugs,
Jeff
