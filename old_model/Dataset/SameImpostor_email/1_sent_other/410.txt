Can you get in touch w/Eldon?  I've been unsuccessful the last two days.  May 
be too late at this point.  I was supposed to get in touch with Jeff 
beginning of the week so that he could order gravel.  And haven't even talked 
to him about the culvert.  If he does the culvert, Eldon's going to have to 
make sure that the other people on the road don't have a fit about Eldon 
"re-designing" the road right around the Dome (which fixing the culvert will 
entail).
