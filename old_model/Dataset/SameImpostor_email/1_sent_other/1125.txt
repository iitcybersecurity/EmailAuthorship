Steve:  FYI.  Don't worry about the conference call, but thought it might b=
e=20
useful to review the proposals prior to Monday's meeting.

See you Monday.

Happy Thanksgiving to all.

Best,

Several IEP companies have been invited to a meeting with the Governor=01,s=
=20
staff next Monday, November 27th.
The following are some options, which the Governor=01,s office is consideri=
ng. =20
IEP is doing some preliminary research on some of these topics.  IEP would=
=20
like to arrange a teleconference call around noon on Monday, November 27th =
to=20
discuss the Governor=01,s meeting.  Please advise us as to whether your hav=

been invited, and who you are sending.
California=01,s electricity supply situation has two inter-related problems=
 =01)=20
(1) high wholesale electricity costs, and (2) marginally adequate supply of=
=20
generation =01) both have combined to create a dysfunctional wholesale=20
electricity market.  The goals should be:
 To assure reliable electricity to California consumers for the lowest=20
reasonable cost.
o Consider requiring that all in-state generation be sold in state.
o Consider re-asserting state authority over the operation, maintenance and=
=20
safety practices of all in-state generating facilities=01, for public healt=
h and=20
safety purposes.
o Consider developing a state power authority to build generation and=20
own/operate transmission.
o Consider requiring utilities both to retain existing and to build new=20
generation.
o Consider providing utilities with authority to stabilize retail prices to=

be paid by consumers through development of an energy portfolio that reduce=
s=20
exposure to spot markets, including contracting forward for much more of=20
their unmet power needs.
o Consider extending consumer rate freeze.
o Consider centralizing power plant dispatch like the other ISOs in the res=
t=20
of the country.
o Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a stat=
e=20
or private entity that can acquire the transmission facilities, and control=
=20
the electricity transmission grid (MUNIs have proposed this).
o Consider sponsoring/supporting legislation to change the ISO and PX board=
s=20
to increase accountability.
o Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand=
=20
reduction and on longer term, broader-based programs.
o Aggressively work to site new generation and transmission facilities, to=
=20
streamline permitting, and to develop renewable resources.
o Call for/sponsor federal FERC reform legislation that would:
o Impose a regional price cap that varies by time of day and year;
o Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority;
o Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices;
o Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices.
o Pressure the FERC to do its job to (1) bring about responsible seller=20
behavior in wholesale electric markets through price controls and other=20
market interventions as necessary, and (2) provide refunds to affected=20
consumers.
