Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action 
FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River 
Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the 
natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were 
happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. 
"The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is 
something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort," but the

Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although 
she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC

Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she 
noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. 
"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in 
the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how 
our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing 
electric generation in California this summer," Breathitt said. If anything, 
she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even 
worse than it is. 
There should have been a "fuller airing of this issue" at FERC before the 
project was certificated, she noted. "It would be counterproductive for this 
Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without
