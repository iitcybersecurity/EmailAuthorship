Yo, people.  I love sports.  Love baseball.  Love you.  But I ain't 
necessarily THAT keen on tying up my Sunday evenings, since, with no school 
this summer, I plan on spending just about every Sunday night driving back 
late from Mendocino, where I'll be working on putting vines in, sporting 
around in that new Zodiac, and shit like that.  And when I ain't there, I 
hope to be backpacking, endurance riding etc.

But y'all should go ahead without me.

Lovingly,
One half of The Sidekicks
