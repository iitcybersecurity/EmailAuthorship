Folks:

As you recall from out meeting on Tuesday, we decided that I'd pull together 
a brief description of our key priorities and the actions underway to achieve 
them.  The status report will be updated weekly.  We'll use the weekly update 
as an important internal communication tool to keep folks abreast of 
activities and developments in CA.  It will also serve as a a tool to help 
identify the need to modify our priorities and/or actions in light of 
ever-changing circumstances.   

We were going to try to get the first report out this week, but with the 
meeting in Houston, Sue's doctor appt and Karen's meetings with Marathon, 
we'll get the first one out Monday.
