I appreciate the efforts, but I have questions about whether Enron's presence 
does more harm than it does good.  I don't think that we want to give Wood 
and/or Brown a soap box to stand on by showing our face there.  Others may 
have a different view of it, but I think that it needs to be consumers, 
consumers, consumers.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
