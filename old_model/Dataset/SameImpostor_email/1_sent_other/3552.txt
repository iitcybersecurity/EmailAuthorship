i won't be in class tonite.  i'm open, too, but to tell you the truth, mark, 
the thought of comparing us and european accounting standards/practices makes 
me break out in a rash.  if there's any way that we can focus on strategy, 
valuation, or other sorts of financial analyses that we've focused on in the 
course, that would be preferable from my perspective.

best,
Jeff
