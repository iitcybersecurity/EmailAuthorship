It's hard to disagree with the fact that 1) the utilities are the ones that 
cut the deal they're living with and 2) they took all of the "stranded cost" 
money that consumers paid them and invested it in other states and 
countries.  

But you can only buy for 10 cents and sell for 5 cents for so long before 
creditors turn off the spigot.  Difficult to see how the spigot stays on with 
the draft decision issued today.  (See story attached, below.)  

With bankruptcy, the only one making any decisions is the judge, and while 
some see benefits to that, seems to us that from a political, financial and 
commercial perspective, bankruptcy creates many more problems than it solves.

That said, we're extremely sensitive to the politics of rate increases.  But 
if the increases are subject to refund, then decision makers can buy 
themselves some time by erring just slightly to the high side of a rate 
increase, which could fend off the ratings agencies and provide additional 
opportunity over the next 90 days or so to scrutinize the utilities claims 
and come up with comprehensive solutions to the bigger problems.

Well, you got my two cents.  Sorry about that.  

Best,
Jeff
