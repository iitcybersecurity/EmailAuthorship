Hey buddy.  I know that you're up in Sacramento and have a much better lay of 
the land than I, but this looks a like a sure fire set up for "the man for 
all seasons" to make an appearance before the legislature.  I have deep 
concerns about us sticking our necks out at these hearings.  Again, have much 
better info, but by all accounts, "witch hunt" seems to be the operative term 
for the hearings.  We are doing very well for ourselves working behind the 
scenes and the risks to us of having someone at a public leg hearing, with 
all the cameras, and all the politicians feeling the primordial urge to 
grandstand are very high.  Let's please discuss this one long and hard before 
making an decision.  I'll be in Sac on the 16th for an AB 1890 Group meeting 
and plan to attend the hearing.

Your pal,
Jeff
