Thanks, Sue.  Agreed.  

Also, I met today with Bowen & Co. re: interconnection.  We have some 
decisions to make on that front, too, which will also require a bit of 
discussion.  

Tracy, I'm sure that Scott's in Istanbul and Donald's in Marrakesh.  Could 
you try to track those two broadband cowboys down and see if we can set up a 
conference call for next Wedneday (hopefully, that's ample lead time)?  

Finally, the draft final tariff (in strike-out-underline form) will be ready 
for review by COB Friday.  I'll email it around.  Hope all is well with all.

Best,
Jeff
