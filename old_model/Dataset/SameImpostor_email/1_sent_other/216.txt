Hey, sounds like life in Bay Watch is treating you well.  Glad to hear you've 
got some classes--8 units?  You really are a bit of a Type A+.  Week after 
next would be best for lunch.  Next week is completely nuts.  I may miss both 
Monday and Tuesday.  Happy hour is a great idea.  I think it's your turn to 
organize.  Have a super weekend  (I've caught a cold, and haven't cracked a 
book since school started, so looks like I'll be buried in books all weekend).

Best,
Jeff
