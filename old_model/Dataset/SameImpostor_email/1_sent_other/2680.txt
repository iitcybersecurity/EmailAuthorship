Attached is a letter that we worked on today and that will be sent to the 
Governor, CA's US Senators (Boxer/Feinstein), congressional folks, and key 
Cal state legislators.  It's going out first thing tomorrow AM.  It builds on 
many of the things we've discussed over the past several months, so there 
shouldn't be any surprises.  If you've got any concerns please give Paul a 
call at home or page me at 888.916.7184.
