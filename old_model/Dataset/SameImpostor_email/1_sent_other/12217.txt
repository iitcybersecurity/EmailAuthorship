Thanks.  Looks like one thing good has happened for them today.  I don't 
think Maviglio will be able to stay.  Your thoughts?  I'm glad he made some 
money off of Enron stock.  (What a jerk.)

Also, we did file the amended complaint yesterday and the motion to quash 
will be filed today.

Best,
Jeff
