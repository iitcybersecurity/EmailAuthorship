Harry:
Tamara Johnson left me a voicemail stating that 1) she phoned Bob 
Weisenmiller requesting that he be our witness 2) there was disagreement 
internally about whether Enron should have testimony 3) she nonetheless 
wanted to try to make sure Bob was available and 4) she would call Bob back 
to discuss further on Tuesday.  Not sure that this is the best way to run a 
railroad. As you mentioned, it's quite inefficient to have EES folks 
contacting our lawyers and reg consultants directly.  I did not respond to 
Tamara's message--thought it would be better to pass along info to you.  We 
can discuss further on Tuesday.  

Best,
Jeff
