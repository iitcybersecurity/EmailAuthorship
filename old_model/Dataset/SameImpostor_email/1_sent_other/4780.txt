Puh-leez.  We did the plastic and the rocks to avoid weeding.  How can there 
be any weeding?  Unfortunately we can't stop by on the way up, but likely on 
the way back, which may be Saturday night.  If so, do you guys wan't to play 
golf on Sunday morning?  (Prentice is leaving with her pals today, and I'm 
heading up sometime tomorrow.)
