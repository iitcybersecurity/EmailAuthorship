Joe, meet Joe.  My apologies.  I've had trouble getting contact information 
for Joe (Kaishkill).  Joe  K. could you confirm that you've received this 
note.  Also, I left you Joe A.'s phone contact numbers on your Houston 
voicemail last week.  Joe A. could you please send Joe K. your contact 
numbers again?  Thanks very much.  

If there's anything else either of you need, please don't hesitate to let me 
know.

All the best,
Jeff
