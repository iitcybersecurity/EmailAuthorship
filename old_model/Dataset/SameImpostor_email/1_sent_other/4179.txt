Shoot.  Remember that I asked many moons ago if you wanted the tickets?  I 
thought you said no.  So I let it go.  Now they've all been snatched up.  But 
I'll see if if those folks are still planning on going.  I think that chances 
are extremely slim, though.  I'll let you know.  Sorry.

Best,
Jeff
