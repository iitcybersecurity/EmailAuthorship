I'm having the same problem.  She states on the izio site that that the cases 
are in the reader.  they ain't.  if anyone has them and could fax them to me 
at 415.782.7854, would be greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff

Also, I like both ideas--Anil's and Mark's.  I think that we could discuss at 
break and write it up then and turn in at beginning of second half of class.  
I'd lean a bit toward the Amazon suggestion, but could go either way.
