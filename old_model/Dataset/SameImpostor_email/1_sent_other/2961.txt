Leslie:  Jeff and Susan might be able to help with the pipeline charges.  
Susan:  I'm not ignoring you.  Of course I'll come.  Give me a call and let's 
figure out a date for me to address your illustrious group.  Jeff:  How's 
married life treating you.  Leslie:  Sorry for all the extraneous babbling.

Best,
Jeff
