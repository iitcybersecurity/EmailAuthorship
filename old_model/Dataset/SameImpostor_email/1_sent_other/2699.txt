Thanks.  These are the portions of the deal that I've been highlighting as 
problematic for us with the settlement group for  the past few weeks.  The 
group knows that unless there's some compromise on these points in a way that 
directly addresses our concerns, we won't be signing anything.  After 
yesterday's call, at which Edison blew the meeting up, there's no deal in 
sight in the immediate term.
