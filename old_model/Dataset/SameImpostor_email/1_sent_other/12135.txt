Interesting points.  However, I don't ever recall you agreeing with every 
Commission decision on disallowances.  And I know you wouldn't establish 
differing standards for IOUs and state water agencies.  

I just hope that this isn't the tip of the iceberg.  

You really think that Campbell is a dim bulb?  A Republican, yes, but I 
haven't heard anyone else describe him as a dim bulb.
