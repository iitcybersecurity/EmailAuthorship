Ah Jeez:
Hey Joseph, I was supposed to trade a name with Deepikah and, wouldn't you 
know, with all the fine print, I grabbed one of yours (bet you're sorry you 
asked me to help out now).  Anywho, I called and left a message with Tim 
Taylor.  You call him yet?  If so, he'll think he's very special, what with 
all of us calling him.  Let me know.

Deepikah, I called Lisa Ralphe off of your list.

Yours in flake-dom,
Jeff
