FYI.  Calger is in active talks with Freeman and DWR lawyers about the offer 
letter we submitted on Tuesday.  Freeman's very anxious to do a deal for 200 
MWs from the West Desk and then start talking about a deal for power from 
Parquet's Pastoria plant.  Credit is of course the issue and Calger's told 
them that unless the credit issue is bulletproof it's not going to work.  See 
Chris' comments below.  It looks like progress is being made, but the details 
will make it or break it.  Any thoughts?  Might make sense to discuss on the 
call.  Please forward along to others.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
