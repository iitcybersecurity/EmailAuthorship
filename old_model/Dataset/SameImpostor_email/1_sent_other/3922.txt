This should help Prentice's chances for employment come the Fall.  You guys 
should have a HUGE phone bill on your room charges.  Please fax me a copy of 
the bill.  I will cover all phone charges.  Also, please forward to me what I 
owe you for the plane flight and golf and our share of dinners, drinks, 
guacamole, etc.

We played spades at the airport.  My team lost..........again.  My losing 
streak now ties DiMaggio's hitting streak.

Best,
Jeff
