Wow.  Don't worry about it.  Have a great time in Montana.  It will be 
gorgeous up there.  You're camped out in Roseville?  You don't deserve that, 
Courtney.  Good idea to find out when the deadlines are.  When you get back, 
give a call and we can meet at break or have lunch or a beer after work or 
something.  Considering your options and keeping them open is a great idea 
and the right thing to do.  Don't stress too much.  Good luck and can't wait 
to hear about Big Sky.

Best,
Jeff
