No.  The decision would have prevented the Commission from implementing the 
legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that 
Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up 
with a compromise to continue to allow direct access.  So all this means is 
that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is 
nothing before the commission to implement.  Sure would have been nice if the 
commission had passed it, though.

Also, did I tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and 
therefore can't do an update call with edward's?  i can, however, do it on 
monday.

best,
jeff
