Greetings Folks:

As you know, the Gas Accord is coming to an end and PG&E's trying to figure 
out where to go from here.  I would argue that what happens with PG&E is 
equally, if not more, important as what happens with SoCal.  

As you also know, we're faced with a retrograde PUC that, by all accounts, 
longs for the "halcyon days" of command-and-control regulation.  As such, I 
think it would be very useful, and cost-effective, to pull together the 
effective coalition we established in the SoCalGas settlement.  

In that coalition, some of us contributed dollars and some contributed 
experts.  I think we should employ that approach again.  I asked Mike Day, 
who I think most agree, did a pretty good job of representing us in the SoCal 
settlement, to make a proposal for representing us in the PG&E case.  Mike's 
proposal is attached.  Finally, if there's anyone else you think we ought to 
include in our coalition, please let me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

Best,
Jeff
