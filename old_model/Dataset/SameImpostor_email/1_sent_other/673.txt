Thanks.  Didn't get it the first time.  Good comments.  I'm actually in 
Vancouver today (Monday) and tomorrow.  Let's keep sending back and forth and 
get together Wednesday morning to finalize.  I'll get a hold of Calger for 
his comments.    You can leave messages on my voicemail, too.

Best,
Jeff
