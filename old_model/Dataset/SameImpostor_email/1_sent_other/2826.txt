Hi Sue:

A very happy new year to you.  Mr Kean has had me underwater since last 
Thursday night, but I'll resurface tomorrow, at which time we can catch up on 
a number of things, including bills.  But I wanted to forward along Steve's 
memo that we discussed just prior to Xmas.  Hope you had a great holiday and 
that all is well.

Best,
Jeff
