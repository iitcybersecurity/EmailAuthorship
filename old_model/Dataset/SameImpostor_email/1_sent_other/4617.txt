Thanks for the commnets, Lynn.

I've faxed you a copy of "Plan B."

I'll let others chime in, but ideally it seemsthat we'd want to start the 
meetings next week and have at least the rough outline of a proposed, 
comprehensive solution to put on the table for discussion.  But at a minimum 
we'd want to get "the process" nailed down by very early next week.

Best,
Jeff
