Thanks very much for getting back to us.  So if I understand the bottom 
line:  1) the customer was mistakenly put back to SoCal (due to the dual 
service territory character of the customer's facilities), 2) the customer 
will be returned to our service, 3) the customer's contract with us expires 
on 5/31, and 4) the customer will have the option of re-signing with us, or 
returning to SoCalGas when the contracts ends on 5/31?  If I've confused 
anything, please let me know.  And thanks again for helping track down the 
info.

Best,
Jeff
