Vail???  Flagstaff??? Man, I'm in the wrong business.  Now listen Stumpy, if 
you think you're going to Vail so some half-#%$#ed customer can run over your 
OTHER knee with a snow mobile, right before your wedding, well think again, 
buster.

I'll see if we can set up a meeting on Thursday the 2nd.

Signed,
Stuck in Lodi Again
