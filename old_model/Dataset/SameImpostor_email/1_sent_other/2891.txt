Scott:  

Could you please see that Sandi gets this?  Thanks.  If folks would like to 
get Sandi information (e.g., the load curtailment proposal discussed by Gary 
yesterday), please send to Scott, who's with our lobbying firm in 
Sacramento.  Sandi, Scott (Stoness) would like to discuss this proposal on 
tomorrow's (Friday's) 8:00 AM conference call.  Thank you.

Best,
Jeff
