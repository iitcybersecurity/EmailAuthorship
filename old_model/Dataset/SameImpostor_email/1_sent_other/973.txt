That's a great idea, and I think that it would be useful to meet with her.  
In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators 
as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.  I'll 
look into setting up a meeting with her.

Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is 
still the best way to go.  And if it weren't for the for the 
"undercollection/refund" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move 
ahead.  

Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's 
likely to be where the hearing goes.  She's been unable in past to control 
Peace at her hearings.

Best,
Jeff
