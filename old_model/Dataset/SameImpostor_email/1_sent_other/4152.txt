Sunday works for me, and we can meet in my office.  But if it's OK, 10 AM 
works better for me.  Let me know.

And Anil has very graciously offered to coordinate the power point 
presentation for the project.  And having worked with Anil on another project 
that required power point, I can vouch that he is at wizard with the 
technology.

Best,
Jeff
