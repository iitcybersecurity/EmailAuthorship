Given that the hearing is Friday, we'll need to decide pretty quickly.   
Might be useful to discuss on a call first thing tomorrow AM?  We'll want to 
assure that our message is tracks consistently with message J. Skilling will 
be delivering this week and with other messages we'llbe delivering (e.g., 
FERC inquiry).  Also, attached are some messages that Jim distributed 
following a focus group conducted in Orange County.
