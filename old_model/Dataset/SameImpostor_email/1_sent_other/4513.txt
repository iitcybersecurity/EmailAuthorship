Marybeth:

I apologize. As I mentioned, this situation is extremely fluid.  I also 
mentioned this morning that in yesterday's meeting w/the Governor, it was 
agreed that the meetings would continue, every day, until the thing got 
resolved.  I was just informed that I've been elected by my management to be 
on today's call (Steve Kean and I will be our representatives).  It starts at 
1PM.  We are scheduled to talk at 2:30 PM.  I'm hoping--but not altogether
