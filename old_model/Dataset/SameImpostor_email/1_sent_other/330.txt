Be happy to discuss.  My preference would be to have a brief call to discuss, 
since Mr. Filner is on a mission to tan a few hides over the price spikes in 
S.D.  At congressional and FERC hearings in S.D. last week, Mr. Filner called 
generators and marketers quite a few ugly names, fingered them as the cause 
for the high prices, and demanded that Congress and FERC make them give all 
the money back to S.D. consumers.  Fairly sensitive item, to put it mildly.  
I'm at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff

Gentlemen:

Steve asked that I follow up with you on the inquiry below.  I met with Bob 
Filner, US Representative from San Diego , who had asked that I forward any 
information to him about Enron's management of energy prices.  Could you 
recommend how we can follow up with him.  I am happy to direct him towards 
you.

Thanks for your help,
Michael
