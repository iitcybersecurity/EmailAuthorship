That's so weird.  Prentice left her car door ajar (when she went to go to 
school yesterday morning, it was dead and she had to get a jump).  

I was surprised that the phone was only 300 pesos.  I thought they'd charge 
by the minute, but apparently, it's a flat 10 pesos for local (i.e., 800 
calls), no matter how long one's one.
