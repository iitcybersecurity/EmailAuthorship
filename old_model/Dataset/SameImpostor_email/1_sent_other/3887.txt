Did we (GA) recommend the extension?  If so, nice recommendation.  Given the 
circumstances, it's a win-win, and still leaves us with the swaption to 
exercise at a later date.  Hope all is well. When I call, you're always in a 
meeting.  I will be on the leadership call tomorrow.  Hope you're well.

Best,
Jeff
