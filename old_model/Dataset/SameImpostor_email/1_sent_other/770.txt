Sue, Mona, and Dasovich--

Would one of you be available for about 30 mins or so tomorrow p.m. (Thurs)=
=20
to square away this issue (maybe around 3 or 4 or so)?  My recollection of=
=20
our original contract language was to capture all of the post-transition=20
period CTCs as set forth in AB1890, so maybe we just need to broaden or=20
clarify what we mean by "residual CTCs".  I'll actually be at 101 Cal=20
starting in the p.m. tomorrow, so this could work out pretty well. =20
Otherwise, I'll be in SR on Friday and then in SoCal next week but back in=
=20
SFO on next Weds for a two day LSI seminar (Dasovich you're speaking at it?=
)=20
Thurs and Fri so we could discuss then too.

Sorry for the short notice and I hope I'll at least be able to say hi to=20
everyone tomorrow.
