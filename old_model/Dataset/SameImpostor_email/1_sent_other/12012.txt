Here's the latest that we have on the legislation ("82XX") released on Friday.
The Assembly Energy Committee will hold an "informational" hearing on 82XX at 
1:30 PM PDT today.
"Informational" means that there won't be a vote today.
Attended a meeting this morning with the business groups with Assemblyman 
Dutra (self-proclaimed pro-biz Democrat, who's an "author"  of 82XX), 
Hertzberg's chief staffer, and Hertzberg's outside legal consultant.
The DWR contracts continue to be the roadblock to a rational solution.
