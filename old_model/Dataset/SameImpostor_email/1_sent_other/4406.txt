OK Gang:

Well, I=01,ve been crunching numbers all day, and haven=01,t yet gotten to =

it'll be a memo from Time's CEO to the Time Board.

I=01,ve leaving now for Mendocino, but will be back early tomorrow to finis=

this up.  Please check out the spreadsheet.

The case is sort of confusing=01*how do Time=01,s analysts value Time at $1=

when they=01,re trading at 109 the day before the announcement of the deal =

Warner.  That doesn=01,t jive.  Are they saying that, absent synergies, the=

combined Time/Warner is worth the enterprise value of Time at 189-212 plus=

the enterprise value of Warner at $63-71 (again, the analysts valuation)? =

That just seems ridiculous, give where they=01,re trading.
