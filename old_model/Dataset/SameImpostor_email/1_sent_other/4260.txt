While I, too, am frustrated at how things turned out, I'm glad your content 
overall with the course.  Definitely one of the best--if not THE 
best--classes I've taken.  I really think that we need to get together 
tomorrow nite to finalize, but I don't feel like pushing it too much.  Your 
thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
