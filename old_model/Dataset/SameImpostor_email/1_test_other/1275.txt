Thanks very much Dave.  We've got the proposal (and we've got a few issues 
with it).  

Rog:
I know that you're swamped managing EES' book, etc.  So I'd be happy to fill 
Dave in on EES' view of CLECA's proposal, the negotiations that are underway 
generally, and what we're cooking up to try to help the negotitations along.  
Just let me know.    

Also, Dave, be happy to talk to Hanson, and fill them in one what's going on 
out there if that would be useful.

Jeff
