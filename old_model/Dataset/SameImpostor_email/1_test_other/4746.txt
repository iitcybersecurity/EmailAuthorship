I'd blow it off.  Your batting 0.9999999999.  In anybody's book, that's 
phenomenal.  Don't look back.  And PR, under the circumstances, is doing a 
stellar job overall.  Vacation was nice.  Thanks.  Bad thing is it made me 
realize how much more of it I need (and likely ain't gonna get soon).

Best,
Jeff
