Well hey there to you!  Man, long time.  I figured you must be married with 
kids by now.

Well, I can tell you that my summer's probably a whole heckuvalot better 
since I'm not in the summer class.  I'm assuming that you're doing it in 
order to get out in 5 semesters?  I decided to do it in 6, but wil only have 
to take one class the last semester.

Been thinking about you (as I've watched my Sun stock crater).  How's it 
going?  What the heck you doing there?

I'm surprised that you've lasted that long in the South Bay.  Good luck
