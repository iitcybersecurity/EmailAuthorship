Might be useful to observe how others react prior to responding.  The good 
senator may have to fight over the surplus with a lot of teachers looking to 
spend the $$s on school books.  That fight could get interesting if the 
backdrop for the debate is a CEC report that sez "no problem, we're in 
charge."

I'm sure we'd be willing to build a few plants for $2 billion...
