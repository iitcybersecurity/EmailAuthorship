Folks.  Let me throw out a proposal.  I believe that we should immediately 
draft a very brief letter or press release that explains why the PD is 
misguided and will lead to very bad energy policy for the state, and why our 
settlement is the right one and why it's good energy policy for the state.  
The letter should be signed by everyone who signed the settlement.  It needs 
to be released by the end of this week.  Absent this kind of action, 
nothing's going to turn this thing around.  Spending time and money writing 
"comments" will be a waste of time and money.  We'll need to do a lot more, 
but I think we have to start this way or fold up our tents now.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff
