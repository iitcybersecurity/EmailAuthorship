Thanks so much for responding, Sally.  Very interested in exploring the 
possibilities with you.  Greatly appreciated. 

Wow, that's the only other Jeff Dasovich I've ever heard of.  No kidding.  
Referred to you by Lee Green. Don't yet have soil test or temp profiles, but 
am in the process of figuring out how to get them done.  Any suggestions are 
welcome and appreciated.  I'll be around the weekend of March 10th.  If that 
works for you, great; otherwise, we can try another date.  

Again, can't thank you enough for responding.  I don't know where it'll lead, 
but I've got a hunch that it just might work out.

Enjoy drinking your wine (had the syrah recently) and very much look forward 
to meeting you.

All the best,
Jeff
