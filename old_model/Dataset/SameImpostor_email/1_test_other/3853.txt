Lamentably, I'm out of the country next week.  Given the B.S. that continue=
s=20
in Sacramento, I suspect that these legislators are likely to be extremely=
=20
cranky at this event (assuming they're not forced to cancel due to the=20
continued inability to find an answer).  Under the circumstances, I would=
=20
suggest that it's likely not the best forum for us.  Might be best to let t=
he=20
legislators slow roast a bit.  If we feel compelled to participate, I sugge=
st=20
Steve Kean.

Best,
Jeff
