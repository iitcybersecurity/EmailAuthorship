Thanks very much, Scott.  Shouldn't be a big problem.  Our buy-down auction 
would require the customer to commit to a fixed reduction over an extended 
period (for a price), and the reduction would have to be verifiable, i.e., 
the customer would need to have the equipment necessary to verify (which 
isn't a problem for large customers).  Sounds like a misunderstanding on the 
part of the legislator and something that we should be able to talk through.  
I'll be there tomorrow.  If it makes sense for me to meet with them, just let 
me know.  Who's the legislator  in charge of demand buy-down?

Best,
Jeff
