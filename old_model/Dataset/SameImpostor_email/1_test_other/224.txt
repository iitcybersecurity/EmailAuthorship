Greetings.  Kim's stuff looks pretty good to me.  There's a pretty high 
likelihood though that I won't be in class Monday or Tuesday either.  That 
means I can't turn in whatever it is we're turning in tomorrow (if I sound 
clueless, it might be because he ran out of handouts in the first class 
describing how the cases would work, and there's nothing posted on the 
site--apologies).  I can do the write-up for next week.
