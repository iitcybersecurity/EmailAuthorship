Did I respond?  (Life is nuts; I'm losing it.)  Anyway, Peter de Vroede 
signed my up with him last week (so I'm not sure why I'm still on the list).  
Anywho, would have been fun.  Sorry I'm already booked.  Had the midterm last 
nite--wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, though I'm sure I made 
about a thousand dumb little mistakes.

Best,
Jeff
