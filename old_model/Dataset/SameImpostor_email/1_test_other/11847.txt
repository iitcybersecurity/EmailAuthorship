Thanks.  As you know, I'm in the negotiations.  It's the best chance there is 
to 1) get a real market and 2) keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  Whether 
California can execute on it is another story.  But we're trying damned hard 
to make it happen.  IEP should support it.  Anything that you can do with Jan 
would be useful and appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
