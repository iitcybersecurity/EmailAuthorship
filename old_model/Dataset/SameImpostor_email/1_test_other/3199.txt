Hi Leslie:

The proposal that ENA submitted to Peevey/Freeman includes a proposal to 
reduce demand by 400 MWs if the state implements financial incentives for 
such reductions (i.e., if the state is willing to pay, say, 7 cents/kwh to 
"produce," it ought to willing to pay 7 cents to "reduce.")  That proposal 
was distributed to the usual, company wide email distribution list last week 
when it was submitted.  We can discuss further on the phone call this morning.

Best,
Jeff
