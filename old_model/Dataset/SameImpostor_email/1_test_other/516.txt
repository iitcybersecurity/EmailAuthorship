Richard:  

Looks good.  One comment:  Under the section "Generating Documents:  Requests 
12, 14 and 18,"  I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph 
starting with "For Portland General..." and not the "alternate ending."  To 
further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty 
extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has 
a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of 
increased wholesale purchases.  Paul Kaufman would have details of the 
request.

Hope your son's doing well.

Best,
Jeff
