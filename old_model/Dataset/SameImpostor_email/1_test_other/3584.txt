Greetings Mark:

Here is the latest.  

ENA signed a short-term deal (5 -week term, I believe) with DWR that goes 
through the end of the month, at which time we have the option to extend the 
deal to a five-year term.  We are discussing other longer-term deals, too.

As Steve points out, we've had serious concerns regarding DWR's 
creditworthiness.  (DWR, the Dept. of Water Resources, is the state agency 
that Davis made the purchaser of power when the utilities hit the financial 
skids a few months ago and the market stopped selling them power.)
