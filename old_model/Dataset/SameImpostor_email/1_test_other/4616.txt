You did an absolutely fabulous job on Sunday.  It was a great time, the food 
was extraordinary, and the wine was better still.  Thanks so much for it 
all.  You're very sweet.

Almost makes any more engagements superfluous, don't you think.  (kidding!)

Don't forget to water the tomatoes!

Best,
Jeff
