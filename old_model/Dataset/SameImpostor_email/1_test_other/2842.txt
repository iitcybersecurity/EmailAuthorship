This touches the issues you and I discussed yesterday.  Seems important to 
have this sort of information flowing well in advance of the activity.  Have 
you or anyone else had a chance to peek at what Sam intends to present to 
legislators?  The more the right is aware of the left hand, and vice versa, 
seems the better off we'll be.  No big deal, but if we get our internal 
process in order at the outset, likely make it easier when the missiles 
really start flying.

Your pal,
Jeff
