Agree.  I think she's already gotten a helluvalot better--a marked and very 
positive change.  Reflection and realization are powerful things.

I'll bring all the paperwork over tonite.  We can go over it then.  It 
actually adds up, as far as I can tell.  It was fun as hell, but it sure 
weren't cheap.

Best,
Jeff
