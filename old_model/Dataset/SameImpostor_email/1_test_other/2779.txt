Thanks for the articles.  Well, not quite in PJs, but yes, working from home, 
which is some consolation.  PG&E has said that a signficant share of gas 
suppliers have stopped transacting with PG&E due to credit risk.  Our 
exposure to PG&E is huge (both EES and ENA), so I wouldn't be surprised if 
we've stopped transacting with them until the Commission comes out with its 
decision on the 4th and we see how the ratings agencies respond.  I can find 
out first thing Tuesday morning.

And a very happy and safe new year to you, too.

Best,
Jeff
