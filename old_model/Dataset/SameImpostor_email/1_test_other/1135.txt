Thanks.  I'll soften the expropriation language.  I don't think they can 
disclose the $1 million on the product liability case, since the entire 
package appears to be one  negotation, all the pieces of which likely have to 
be agreed to, or no settlement.  But you're point's well taken and I'll try 
to acount for it in the answer.  Finally, I can't see disclosing the fact 
that I'm infringing on someone's patent in my annual report.  Seems like I'd 
have a hard time defending myself in court if they sued me, if I'd admitted 
it to it in my annual report.

If I don't see you tomorrow, have a good week.
