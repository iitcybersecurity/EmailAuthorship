Agree that we should decline to participate.  I also got a call from IEP 
regarding the press conference and strongly encouraged them to signicantly 
diversify the group to include customers, consumer groups, and the like.

Haven't heard about the meeting on the first with the governor's staff.  
Interesting that the administration is choosing to meet with folks on the day 
that the report is released.  For the same reasons that we wouldn't want to 
be grouped with generators at a press conference, we may not want to be 
grouped with generators when the staff disseminates the report's words of 
wisdom.
