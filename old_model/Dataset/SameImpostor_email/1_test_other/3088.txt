We haven't been to the PUC about re-sourcing our customers.  Sue mentioned 
that this morning.  Good idea to get over there.  Mike's going to the PUC 
tomorrow to make the rounds.  

Is there legislation on DSM and expedited siting?  I haven't seen anything 
we've provided on DSM or expedited siting-related legislation.
