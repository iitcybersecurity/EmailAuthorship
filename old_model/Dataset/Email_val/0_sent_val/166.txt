All trades were originally confirmed in the name of Dow Hydrocarbons and 
Resources Inc.  The Dow trader (Mike Blillings) subsequently contacted the 
desk and requested that all trades be booked in the name of "The Dow Chemical 
Company".  Mary Gosnell contacted Cathy Tudon in credit and Cathy approved 
the changes.  Let me know if you have any comment for the desk.  SS
