Tracy:  These guys emailed only names of lawyers, accountants, etc.!  
Rawleigh White is the CFO for the tribe.  The "broker" intermediary is Jeff 
Fuller with Power Resources Managers (425-451-9123) who told me that the 
tribe is an Oregon tribe located in Bend, Oregon.  I will separately send you 
Stewart's prior message.  I'll send these guys a draft (without credit).  
Thanks.
