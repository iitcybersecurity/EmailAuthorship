Tana:  I've already spoken with Clem this morning and he is on board with 
this form.  The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em 
(marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed 
right away.  Clem is going on vacation Friday.  We should also email a copy 
to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.  PG&E will send execution copies 
to me.  The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599.  
Thanks for your help.  Sara
