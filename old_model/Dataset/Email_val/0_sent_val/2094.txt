John:  The "signature block" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done 
through the U.K. agent actually looks different.  It should read something 
like "Company X, as agent for ENA", for example.  Therefore, Insitnet needs 
to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the 
process of being drafted).  You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet 
agreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agency 
arrangement before proceeding.

You are also correct about the ITG agreement.  In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an 
executed agreement with POSIT.  I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months 
ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in 
writing.

Thanks.  Sara
