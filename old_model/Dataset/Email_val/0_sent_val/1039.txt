Lynn Aven and I are in the process of finalizing a memo on the Argentina trip 
and we will also have a separate list of "action points" for Mike G.  I am 
not planning to do anything further with respect to Argentina per your 
instructions (eg, there is an ADA conference in June and we have been asked 
to provide a speaker; we have been asked to comment on the ADA local master 
format; finalizine trader guidelines and termsheet format).  Also, I am not 
planning to do anything further with respect to Brazil other than finalize 
our financial trading matrix.  I have cancelled my trip to Sao Paulo at the 
end of March and will table the "derivatives training" indefinitelly.
