Melissa:

I started with Sempra.  It's one of the more unusual masters ( a "Master 
Master"  covering both physical and financial) and it's not the typical "ECT 
Master".  Further, it contains no rounding or correction to published prices 
provisions.

We'll have to review these masters on a case by case basis.
