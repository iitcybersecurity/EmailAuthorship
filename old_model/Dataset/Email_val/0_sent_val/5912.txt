Bob:  

Thanks for the update.  No need to call back but here are my comments:

Allied Waste North America - please follow up on your own as the paralegals 
don't have the resources right now for handling all of Sam's load

FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since 
this is also one of Sam's items

City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or "Bank Ltd") -  neither of these are 
on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish

Proctor & Gamble - please return to me for further handling.  Ed Quinn is 
leaving Enron

Thanks and let me know if you have any questions.
