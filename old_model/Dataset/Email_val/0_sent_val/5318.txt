Susan:  Per Tanya's message below, please prepare a draft Schedule for the 
bank listed below.  There is no CSA.  Angela can help you with the choices.  
THIS IS A DEAL SPECIFIC ISDA SCHEDULE and not for general use.

Angela:  I know that this Schedule will never be accepted in total but it 
highlights the ENA priorities.  You can forward to the Rabobank person who 
sent the email request the other day and David Barbour et al.  I would 
appreciate if you could handle and I'll let you know when I'm back in the 
office for good.

Thank you both.  Sara
