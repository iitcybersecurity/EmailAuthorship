Laurel:  Will John be trading in the names of BOTH ENA and ECT Investments, 
Inc. or only one of them?  Is John located in London temporarily?  Will 
Houston book the trades pursuant to the agency agreement? (I'm not certain 
which companies are covered by the agreement).  Let's discuss.  Thanks.  Sara
