Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a repo 
agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory, please 
advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific consent.  
Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron Credit 
Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own form of 
unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.
