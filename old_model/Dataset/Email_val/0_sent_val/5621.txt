Richard:

Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties 
are impossible to meet  (2/16/01 was last Friday).  The same agreement with 
ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.  

Please advise as to who in credit approved the USD25million Enron Corp. 
guaranty on behalf of ECI.  Also, FYI, Bear will not provide a reciprocal 
guaranty for ENA.
