Hello AFAC and Marcelo:  Attached is a recent "short list" of possible 
products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future.  
The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels 
frequently to Brazil.  Bruce will join us by telephone next week.  
My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, 
further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's 
list.  Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, 
as will Andrea Bertone.  We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from 
Houston.  This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed 
later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 
29.  I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.  I'm looking forward to our 
meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.  See you both soon.  Regards.  Sara
