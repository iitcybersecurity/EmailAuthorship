Carol:

(1)  see Tanya's note re:  Occidental

(2)  I think I negotiated either a confirm or Schedule with a Trust (I'll try 
to find).  Of course, there are lots of structured deals with Trusts.

(3)  I don't have strong feelings about the offsite - but I'd vote for the 
a.m. rather than change the legal credit seminar to accommodate the offsite.
