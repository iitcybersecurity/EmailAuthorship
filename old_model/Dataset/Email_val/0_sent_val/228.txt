OK, this is hot off the press.  
Tanya:  our Performance Impairment language limited the collateral call to 
1.1 times outstanding exposure.  The collateral was defined only as Letters 
of Credit and the issuing bank was at least A- S&P rated.  As to the 
Threshold, well, you can read the response.
Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
