I will be at the presentation.  I can not make a faculty lunch that day -- 
it's my mother's birthday and she lives in Austin, so I have already 
committed to lunch with her.  Just let me know the details on how soon you 
would like for me to arrive at the Alumni Center, and if there is anything 
else that I can do.  --Sally
