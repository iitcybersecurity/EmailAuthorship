I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note 
regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, 
I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our 
commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 
people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor 
meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and 
yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with 
our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and 
Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net 
Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key 
Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in 
this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more 
than anything else.  --Sally
