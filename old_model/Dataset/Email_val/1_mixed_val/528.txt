This is an issue we have long struggled with.  We have conducted several 
comprehensive reviews in the past and on an ongoing basis we go through a 
resource allocation process which enables subjective criteria to be 
considered in the prioritization and resource allocation process.  I think 
the project is a good idea.  Your sources would be John, Jim Steffes, and 
Rick Shapiro (for the RCR, or resource commitment process).
