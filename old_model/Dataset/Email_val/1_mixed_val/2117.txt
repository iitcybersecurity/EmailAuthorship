We did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support.  I 
have also discussed this at length with Brent, and agree that the shift of 
manager positions to front to back looks across each region (eliminating the 
OA and Deal Validation manager roles) makes sense.  Upon the recommendation 
of Susan and Brent, I am comfortable with appointing Jeff Gossett as the 
manager of the West region.
