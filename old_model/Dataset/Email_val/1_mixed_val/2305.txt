Thanks for sending the dates in writing.  We already have this on our home 
calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit.  I did confirm 
that there is a home football game on Friday, November 3, so if you all are 
interested in going, we will have plenty of tickets.  The weather should be 
great here then. 

I have also blocked off Friday, November 3 from work so that we can do 
something fun with the kids -- zoo, Children's Museum, etc. 

I sent Mo an e:mail message about your stay in Houston in hopes that she may 
need to be in Houston at that time.  I will let you know what I hear from 
her.
