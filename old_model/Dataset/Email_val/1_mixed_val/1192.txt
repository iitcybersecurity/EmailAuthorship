Joe, 

Thanks for your message. It would be difficult to rearrange  the meeting at 
this point, given that it was 
timed around the availability of Jeff Skilling. I doubt we could get Jeff for 
any other date at this point. We can still adjust
the agenda to discuss and address the Content Services issues. I shall work 
on this with John and Ravi.

Vince
