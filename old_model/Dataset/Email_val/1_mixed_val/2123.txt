I realize the group may go a different way with this, but I remain convinced 
that we should go to a pure number system (ie a pure relative ranking) and 
use the behaviors and skills descriptions as a way of discussing the 
differences between people.  Just adding the qualifier "relative to peers" 
glosses over what's really going on.  The behavior and skill descriptors tell 
everyone what is valued here and guide the discussion.  The relative ranking 
lets us have the flexibility to meet business needs by getting tighter or 
"looser" on performance rankings, terminations, and comp.
