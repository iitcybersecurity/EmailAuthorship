I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.  I had put her on the list 
of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.  He had asked about 
someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that 
she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.  I 
don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that 
conference call.  What is she going to do for you in gas?  We may be 
hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has 
been as involved with EOL.  --Sally
