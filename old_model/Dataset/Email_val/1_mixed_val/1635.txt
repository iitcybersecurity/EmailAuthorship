Abstract:

The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may reflect the flaws in power pools design and incomplete transition to 
fully deregulated markets in
generation and transmission.
