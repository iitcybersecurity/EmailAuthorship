Tim -- Cindy manages this program.
Mary -- please give some thought to how we might solicit employee views on 
this.
Cindy -- I believe we already allow matching of donations to quasi-religious 
organizations: religious schools, for example, and perhaps relief 
organizations like Catholic Relief Services?  I think that if we want to 
consider extending it we should probably discuss it in a smaller group than 
the e-speak forum --  the Enron Foundation Board perhaps?  This could become 
controversial, though (recall the Planned Parenthood debate and the periodic 
attempts of shareholders to add restrictions through the proxy mechanism).
