Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum.  There will be approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at 
the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid and back office operations for 
the following Enron entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South 
America, Enron Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband 
Services and Enron Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, 
Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New York (metals business-maybe!).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.
