Steve,

I shall talk to John Sherriff about such issues. My intention
is to vest you with maximum decision making powers. It makes most sense to
me to make decisions where the information resides.

Please, invite Anjam or alternatively make reservations for dinner and
let Shirley know. Shirley can send an invitation to everybody  in the group
on my behalf. It would be really bad to exclude Anjam from the dinner.

It 

Vince
