Glad you got some rain.  We are still doing lots of watering on the yard.  No 
water rationing in our area yet, but it has been put in place in many areas 
in and around Houston. 

I have to be in Austin for a presentation and reception late afternoon on 
September 5, so I thought that it would be fun to try to come earlier and 
have lunch for your birthday.  I haven't made flight reservations yet, but I 
am sure that I can work it to be at the University Club by 12:15.  

Looks as if the whole family will go to Hallettsville on the 9th.  David and 
I will enjoy the drive, and I am sure that the girls will enjoy the sleep on 
the way over!
