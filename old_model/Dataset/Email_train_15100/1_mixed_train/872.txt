Chris,

I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments.

1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation 
equation and
the way it's typically discretized.

2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain 
what CT is (perhaps a footnote).
