Thanks.  Yes, I did know about the conference.  Ken has a copy of the study 
and made reference to it several times during our visits to Sac. a couple of 
weeks ago.  It's nice to occasionally see some rational thinking in 
California.  
I look forward to catching up with you when I get back to town.
