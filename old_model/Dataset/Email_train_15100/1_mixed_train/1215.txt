Thanks for the update on Dad.  Keep me posted on what you hear.  No, I didn't 
get the message that Cara had called.  With almost two teenagers in the 
house, my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance!  I 
will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from 
work.  --Sally
