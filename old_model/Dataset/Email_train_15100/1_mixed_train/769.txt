I like it.  Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand 
side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of 
those efforts?  Normally, we wouldn't do such an announcement without a 
specific deal to report, but in light of the special circumstances in 
California perhaps we should consider it.
