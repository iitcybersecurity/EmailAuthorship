I appreciate you pressing this issue.  You should both be aware that 
Unocal(?) has been sued by the families of four employees who were shot in 
Pakistan a couple of years ago.  Their claim is that the company did not 
provide adequate security and ignored official warnings of trouble in the 
region.
