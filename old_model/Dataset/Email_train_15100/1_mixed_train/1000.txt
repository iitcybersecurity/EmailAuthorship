Roman,

I shall type in English (faster).

I was trying to locate you for some time after you left SCEM. I shall be glad 
to
meet for dinner/coffee and chat. Please, send me your phone number.

I have just come back from Poland and go through my mail. I shall try to 
reach you later
this week.

Vince
