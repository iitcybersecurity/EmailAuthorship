Monica:  Thanks for the form.  I can verify that Enron Capital & Trade 
Resources Corp., now Enron North America Corp. (by virtue of a name change), 
entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement with The Chase Manhattan Bank 
dated January 29, 1998.  Please let me know if you need anything further.  
Thanks.  Sara
