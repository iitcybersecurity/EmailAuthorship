Holli:

As you know, Enron is closed on 12/26/00.   I'll try to schedule a call for 
12/27/00.  I have not received the CSA yet so we cannot do anytning on that 
front.  Also, will you please tell me where the dealers able to quote Mid-C 
are located (since EWEB has not answered my prior email)?  Thanks.  Sara
