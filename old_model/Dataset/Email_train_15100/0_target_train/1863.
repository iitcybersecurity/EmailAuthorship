Tana:  I don't know who Brad Diebner is.  However, Greg called me.  What Greg 
really needs is the ENA "form" of ISDA Schedule (with the utility election). 
He will also need a "generic" Paragraph 13.  The boilerplate can be mailed.  
Before you send, I need to chat with Mark and I'll let you know more later 
today.  Thanks.  Sara
