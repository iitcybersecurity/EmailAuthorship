You should contact ECT's counterparties periodically throughout the 
negotiation process, as warranted.  Please call NYSEG to follow up.  Also, 
Carol is reviewing the PSE&G comparison so please call her and you guys can 
review the ISDA together.  If you are uncertain as to how to keep in touch 
with our counterparties, please chat with me.  Thanks.  SS
