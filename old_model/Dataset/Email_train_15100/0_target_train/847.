Brent:  Gabby Aguilar(?) from BA has requested Lynn for an "immediate white 
paper" addressing tax issues for physical (power, gas and I don't know what 
else) and financial trading in Argentina.  What phone call on Thursday were 
you referring to on your voice mail?  I'll try to call you in about an hour.
