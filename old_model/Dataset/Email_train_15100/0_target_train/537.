I would suggest the following:

 "This is a Confirmation of an Option offered by ____________ to ENA and 
accepted by ENA pursuant to a telephone conversation on ___________ between 
the parties."

I don't know whether this is an omnibus or master but use language 
accordingly.  Call if you have questions.   ss
