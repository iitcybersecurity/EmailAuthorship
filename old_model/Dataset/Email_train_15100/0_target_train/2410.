Stephanie:  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

Please follow up with this guy.  Looks like he's in London.  We need to 
verify that he's with Harvard, either through Caroline or asking that he send 
a faxed request so that we can see the letterhead, etc.  Also, please keep 
track of the fully executed master.  Thanks.  Sara
