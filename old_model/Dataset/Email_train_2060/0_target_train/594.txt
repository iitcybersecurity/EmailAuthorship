Please call.  Brent and I missed you this morning.  Here's the extent of what 
I was able to find out.  We called Andrea Bertone and left word.  I think 
she's calling Brent (as I was on a conference call when she rang back).  Pat 
Cini will join our Friday morning meetings.  Is Michael Herman taking over 
Brazil financial?  SS
