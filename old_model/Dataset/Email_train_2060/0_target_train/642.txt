Thanks for remembering me (even though I FORGOT to send you birthday wishes 
last month).  It doesn't seem like a year, does it?  Hope you're doing great 
and your family is well.  How's the HOUSE OF THE CENTURY coming along?  I 
recall looking at the plans just "yesterday".  Stay well (and young).  Sara
