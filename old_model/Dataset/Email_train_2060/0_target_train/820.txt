Are the certificate(s) to be issued by BONY restricted or common?  (sounds 
like restricted and to be issued in the name of PEP)  I think that we can 
lodge the physical securities at MS (in the vault) for the account of 
Enron....Holdings XII with a stock power from PEP.  Are we headed in the same 
direction here?  SS
