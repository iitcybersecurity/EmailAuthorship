Attached AS AN EXAMPLE ONLY is a "Transition Memo" which Marie prepared to 
capture her current workload.  Could you please utilize that format and 
prepare a summary of your current workload?  Mark, Carol and I would like to 
receive your lists as soon as possible, but no later than Thursday evening.  
Thanks.  Sara
