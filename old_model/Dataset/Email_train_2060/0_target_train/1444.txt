Kaye:  I would like to schedule a meeting for sometime after June 8 (when our 
new paralegal Samantha arrives) with Donna and Samantha.  We will need a 
conference room.  1 hour.  Taffy has Samantha's schedule.  I know she has 
orientation on June 8.  If Tana is "training" on June 9, 10, etc., I could 
borrow 1 hour.  Thanks.  Sara
