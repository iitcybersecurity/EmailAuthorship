Tracy:  Thanks!!!!!  (and I'll call Yair in a day or so if I haven't heard 
from him)

New Question:  Will you be handling credit for the Washington Public Utility 
Districts (Benton, Franklin and Grays Harbor)?  I spoke with Jeff Fuller 
(PRM) and a lawyer for the PUDs yesterday and I'm analyzing the authority 
issue.
