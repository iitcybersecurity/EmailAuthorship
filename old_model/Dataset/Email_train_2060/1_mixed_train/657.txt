We will also have both of our cell phones with us:

David  713-299-1436
Sally    713-417-1591

We will hope for a little warmer weather in Fort Lauderdale!!  The game is on 
Wednesday evening - we will do some sightseeing during the day on Wednesday.  
I will be back in the office on Thursday afternoon.  Love, Sally
