Laine,

I can initial it. Please, contact Beth Perlman as an IT officer.
I shall explain the reason we are buying the software to her.

I want the software to reside in our London office - the software is used
primarily by European utilities and we shall use it as a pricing tool
in negotiations with European clients.
