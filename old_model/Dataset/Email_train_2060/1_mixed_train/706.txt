I know that there was a pretty serious set of audit findings from the TX 
RRCommission earlier this year.  I suspect this is a result of that.  Brenda 
Herod was involved in the download meeting with the rep from the TRRC.  If 
she hasn't already told  you about that meeting, you may to visit with her on 
that.  --Sally
