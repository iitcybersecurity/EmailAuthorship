I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has 
been filed. I am fairly certain there is no new filing. However, the  
Plaintiff's  discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin 
McConville, an ECT/ENA officer, through his board position and involvement at 
NSM Management Co. acted improperly. I wouldn't close your file yet.
