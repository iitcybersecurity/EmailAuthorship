I think this is a fine attempt, but I continue to believe that a pure 
relative ranking offers the most flexibility and is more like the way the 
process works in practice.  A separate list of desired behaviors, criteria 
etc can be used to guide discussion but I believe the ranking itself should 
remain purely relative.
