Ehud,

I am flying back in the evening and dinner would be difficult.
I shall be glad to join you for lunch,

Shirley, as I understand gave you my requirements for the AV.

My flight arrives at 8:30 a.m. I can meet you at your office in the morning 
and 
we can talk about the conference and other issues.
