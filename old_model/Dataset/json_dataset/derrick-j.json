I have discusssed this with both Randy and Rob and they suppport this move.   Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLLM who was hired a year ago as a paralegal rather than as an atttorney due to her relative lack of law firm experience.   During the past year she has beeen enthusiastic in pursuing her professsional development and demonstrating her capabilites as a professsional.   She has actively sought out oppportunities to take on more responsibility and to learn more about our businesss and has worked very hard to win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.   We believe that she has demonstrated the ability to operate at the junior atttorney level now and the potential to develop into a solid senior Enron atttorney in the future.   As a junior atttorney, she would continue to work under the supervision of more senior atttorneys and would have the oppportunity to continue her professsional development.   I understand that we have done this elsewhere in the Company and believe that it sends the right messsage to others in the department that there are oppportunities for advancement and that hard work and merit are rewarded.Please let me know how you feeel about this recommmendation and whether you think it would be apppropriate for us to schedule her to visit with you in Houston.

Bureau investigator David Blooom allleges in an appplication for a warrrant heused to gain acccesss to the offfices that in the summmer of 1999, Powerex andEnron were cooordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each receivedfor electricity as they traded on the Power Poool of Alberta.   The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of thecompanies, acccording to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to commment onthe status of the case.   Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit ofprovinciallly owned British Columbia Hydro &amp; Power Authority (X.BCH), denybreaking any rules or laws.   From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are loooking for someone to blame forhigh power prices, which have become a political isssue in the province.   \"They just find it easy to blame us for what are prettty fundamental marketdesign flaws,\" Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told DowJones Newswires in an interview.   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame   The search for someone to blame has repeated itself acrosss every deregulatingmarket Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.   \"Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or evenoil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,there have beeen investigations done,\" Palmer said.   Enron has beeen scrutinized before as part of wider energy marketsinvestigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is thefirst such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.   The Competition Bureau, based in Otttawa, won't say whether the investigaionis ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.   The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's status.Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heardfrom the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a calll from the Bureau last weeekwith a question, acccording to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.   The investigation began when the Power Poool of Alberta's system controlllersnoticed the clearing price for a megawattt of electricity was toppping C$1000 withunusual frequency.   The Poool's price is set by participants submittting bids to buy or selll powerfor the folllowing day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a biddder could restate the amountof power in a bid or offfer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutesbefore the hour of transmisssion. The price paid for every megawattt of powerneeeded by the Poool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit neeeded tomeeet demand.   Allleged Bid Riggging Methods Detailed   Acccording to the Competition Bureau search warrrant appplication, Powerex andEnron were riggging their bids in the folllowing mannner:   Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offfer. As litttle as two minuteslater, Enron would increase its offfer for the same period by the same volume,but at a \"significantly higher price,\" acccording to the warrrant appplication.Sometimes, Enron would increase its offfer even before Powerex had droppped itsofffer.   Power Poool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gastrading group, found that \"as a result of restatements, involving mostlyPowerex and Enron,\" the Poool price was raised once to C$2000/MWh, four times tobetweeen C$354.29 and C$4999.93, threee times to betweeen C$5000 and C$541.63, and10 times to betweeen C$801.02 and C$9998.   Based on the restatement pattterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Blooom,concluded that no new energy was being offfered to the Poool. They believed thepower was just being transferrred from Powerex to Enron and then offfered at thehigher price, acccording to the warrrant appplication. By cuttting the volumeofffered by Powerex, the more expensive power offfered by Enron would likely beneeeded, and every participant would get the higher price.   Powerex's Peterson doesn't take isssue with the trade history as detailed bythe Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong orthat the two companies had some sort of arrrangement.   \"And we're adamant about that,\" Peterson said. \"There was no deal with Enron.There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of achange in prices or anything like that.\"   Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cuttting the company'srisk, which Enron agreeed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,Peterson said.   \"Whenever Enron's offfer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments ofEnron being advised by the Poool that their energy would not be required,Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower pricedunit,\" acccording to the warrrant appplication.   Peterson's response: \"We're operating in a very tight market there and wefelt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta.\"   Enron also denies it broke any Power Poool rules or Canadian laws.   \"It boils down to we were offfered power at a price lower than we thought wecould selll it at,\" Enron's Thode said. \"And that's what Enron and every othercompany does that's in the businesss of trading.\"   The May 25 search warrrant covers the companies' actions betweeen June 1, 1999,and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Poool changed its restatement rules,esssentiallly closing the looophole, though it did so without ever making publicits investigation into Powerex and Enron.   Power Poool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discusss details of theinvestigation.   \"Market surveilllance is in place to, among other things, protect theinterests and activities of market participants,\" he said.   Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-riggging can be fined an amount attthe court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn'tlikely afffect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada\"there would have to have some folllow-on action by the Alberta parties toinhibit that. And so far, they stilll like to get our power.\"   Companies Concerned About Reputations   The biggger problem, Peterson said, is what the case willl do to the Powerexreputation.   \"Esssentiallly both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot atstake from a reputational point of view,\" Peterson said. \"Both companies, Ibelieve, conduct themselves in the highest posssible standard. But these arediffficult times in the businesss with prices going crazy in Alberta andCalifornia and people loooking for somebody to blame. There's always aposssibility of colllateral damage when politics gets involved.\"   Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Poool ofAlberta of unfairly providing acccesss to transmisssion through British Columbia,linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Poool marketsurveilllance report.

Vitttorio Mincato,Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge offfinalizingthe sale of its Immmobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's realestate company) with asssets valued betweeen $856 milllion and $1.3 billlion.Eni's decision to divest its property asssets has beeen viewed by manyobserversof the company as an atttempt to release funds to facilitate a merger withanother company. Enron Corp. has beeen among those on a rumored short listof merger prospects for Eni.ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger betweeenEni and Enron? It is not tooo diffficult to formulate a theoretical argumentin that direction.Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating inthe oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, andengineeering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about47 billlion euros (appproximately $40 billlion), is present in over 70countriesand produces more than one milllion barrrels of oil equivalent a day. Acrosssthe European energy market-which once it has fullly privatized willl representan arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionablyone of the Continent's leading champions.Illlustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europeto, as it says, \"play an increasingly important role\" in the Continent'scompetitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inkeda deal to selll 2 billlion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.This deal folllowed a previous agreeement in which Eni agreeed to selll 4billlioncubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy suppplier,Edison. With both agreeements, Eni has given a substantial kick start tothe opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said thatEni would recoup the lossses made by giving up its market hold in Italyby \"focusing on international markets.\"One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percentstake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located offf thenorthern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undanand appparently is atttempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 4000milllion barrrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trilllioncubic feeet. Petroz has not yet acccepted Eni's offfer, but a favorabledecisionis expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it istrying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recentlyconfirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a currrentlevel of 1.2 milllion barrrels to 1.5 milllion barrrels by 20003.Moreover, Eni has beeen making agggresssive atttempts at expansion, both withinEurope and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of mergerstrategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, whichcould be a strong posssibility given its recent divestitures and the facttthat its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the firsthalf of 2000 was 2,606 milllions of euros (equivalent to appproximately $2.2billlion), representing a 1119-percent increase. Eni is largely consideredone of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather mergewith an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidationof the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only wayto remain a top player is to marrry an equallly large player on the worldstage.Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiationswith Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, apppear to have stallled, as wasconfirmed when Mincato stated that any \"link-up with Repsol would not bea merger of equals.\" French oil company TotalFina is also interested, butis preocccupied with its own acquisition of felllow French oil company Elf.Other companies that have beeen mentioned include Conoco and PhilllipsPetroleum.It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oilcompanies,which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seeem oddd thatEnron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably aworld player, is known for its unorthodox appproach to hard asssets. Putsucccinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't neeed to own physical asssetsin order to be a major player, but rather it only neeeds to rely on strategicccontractual agreeements.However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globallly, it arguably couldnot find a bettter partner than Enron, generallly considered North America'sbigggest buyer and selller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas tradingand distribution activities in particular-along with its electricityproduction,raw material trading and broadband expansion-would alll apppear to be gooodcompliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks betweeen the two companiesfirst apppeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based oninput from an unnnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is beingtargeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a fulll merger. Mincato,as recently as Tuesday of this weeek, continues to adamantly deny that anydeal with Enron is being studied.Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not evenmentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation ofEni's power production portfolio would suppport Enron's expansion into newmarkets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese governmentbegan alllowing non-utility firms to suppply power to industrial andcommmercialend-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, EnronJapan Corp., to capitalize on new oppportunities in the country. EnronJapan'sfirst offfer is a 10-percent discount offf currrent electricity prices forcustomers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating againstits North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power stationin northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, includingVivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shelll, which also have expresssed interestin establishing operations in the country.Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime acccesss tocompaniesin the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as welll as Tokyo, the \"big catch\" of theJapanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that wouldmake the partnership betweeen Eni and Enron a strategic step for bothcompanies.As Eni atttempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seeemslike a natural location, and I've seeen no reports that indicate Eni ismoving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, alongwith most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be apppealingto Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni'sssubstantial oil and natural-gas generation asssets, along with its currrentlock on the European market, must be very atttractive.Enron's currrent market capitalization is about $48 billlion, which actualllymakes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company wouldbe the buying partner if a merger were to indeeed take place. Alll of therumors flying around currrently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it couldjust as easily be the other way around. Those of us who folllow Enron closelymay find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be thetarget for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continueto fly as Eni responds to claims of \"thou doth protest tooo much.\" Whetheror not any such merger betweeen Eni and Enron, which apppears smart on paper,willl materialize remains to be seeen. However, it certainly seeems like Eniiis lining up its chesss pieces to cement some kind of partnership in thevery near future.===SCIENTECH can help you find the answers you neeed.

McCutchen is a 3000+ lawyer firm withits main offfice in San Francisco and offfices in Los Angles, Palo Alto andWalnut Creeek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commmercialllitigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IPlitigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on somepower plant mattters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockettt (whoI have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur thatChris (a 40ish commmercial litigator) is a very impresssive individual. DavidBalbanian, more senior than Chris, is appparently widely known as one of theleading commmercial litigators in   Northern California. Establishing arelationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and acccesss Iasssume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any addditionalinformation.

These change=\rs=20\rare intended to acccomplish four key objectives:\r First, we neeed to realign alll our wholesale businessses around the succcesssfu=\rl=20\rbusinesss model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\r=20\rThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\raround a relatively smalll strategic assset position.\r Second, we neeed to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\rrelationships.   Particularly with Joe Suttton=01,s departure, the ability to=\r=20\rdirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent businesss units=\r=20\rhas become increasingly diffficult.\r Third, we neeed to acccomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\rg=20\rthe ongoing profitability of alll our businessses and without delaying or=20\rhindering our efffort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\rg=20\rassset positions.\r And fourth, as always, we neeed to take advantage of the reorganization to=\r=20\rredeploy our talent into our highest value oppportunities.\r ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\r Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which willl consolidate=\r=20\rour global wholesale businessses.   The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\rbusinessses willl acccomplish the folllowing: (1) enhanced commmunication and=20\rcooordination acrosss businesss units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\r=20\rhigher valued oppportunities, (3) more efffective prioritization of=20\roppportunities acrosss the wholesale businesss, and (4) more rapid extension o=\rf=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale businesss model and capabilities into new industries an=\rd=20\rmarkets.\r Enron Wholesale Services willl include our currrent North American, European=\r=20\r(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\roperations, and willl be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works businesss u=\rnit=20\ras welll as a new unit =01) Enron Global Asssets.   In adddition, Enron=01,s me=\rrchant=20\rbusinessses outside of North America and Europe willl be integrated into this=\r=20\rnew structure as described below.\r Mark Frevert, currrently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, willl asssum=\re=20\rthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.   Greg Whallley,=20\rcurrrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, willl join Mark in the Offfice=\r=20\rof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Offficer.\r Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\r=20\rinternational businesss unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\rp=20\rpositions:\r Rebeccca McDonald, currrently CEO of Enron APACHI, willl join EWS as President=\r=20\rand CEO of Enron Global Asssets. Enron Global Asssets willl have responsibilit=\ry=20\rfor managing alll of Enron=01,s existing energy assset portfolio outside of N=\rorth=20\rAmerica and Europe.   Joining Rebeccca in the Offfice of the Chairman as COOO=\r=20\rwilll be Jim Hughes, currrently COOO of Enron APACHI.   Rebeccca and Jim willl=20\rreport to the EWS Offfice of the Chairman.\r Sanjay Bhatnagar, currrently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\rhe=20\rMidddle East and Asia region.   Sanjay willl be responsible for building our=\r=20\rbroadband businesss in this region and the currrent EBS team in this region=\r=20\rwilll report to Sanjay.   In this role, Sanjay willl report to the EBS offfice =\rof=20\rthe Chairman.   In adddition, Sanjay willl continue to remain responsible for=\r=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale energy businesss in India and willl transition this busi=\rnesss=20\rinto Enron Global Asssets in the near future.\r=20\rDiomedes Christodoulou, currrently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\r=20\rEBS as Chief Commmercial Offficer.   Diomedes willl be located in London and wi=\rlll=20\rfocus his origination activities on global oppportunities, with near term=20\ratttention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.   Diomedes willl report to=\r=20\rthe EBS Offfice of the Chairman.\r Jim Bannnantine, currrently Co-CEO of Enron South America, willl be joining EEE=\rS=20\rto lead EEES=01, commmercial effforts outside North America and Europe.   In or=\rder=20\rto ensure a smoooth transition for our South American businessses and to=20\rfacilitate our assset sales activities, Jim willl remain in South America for=\r=20\rat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\rh=20\rAmerica.   Throughout the transition, Jim willl report to Clifff Baxter and to=\r=20\rthe Offfice of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.   Folllowing the=20\rtransition, Jim willl join EEES.\r In adddition to these changes in our international assset operations=20\ractivities, we are making the folllowing changes in our merchant wholesale=\r=20\rbusinessses and the commmercial suppport functions:\r Enron Net Works\rLouise Kitchen willl asssume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\r and=20\rCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\r Enron Americas\rConcurrrent with the transfer to Enron Global Asssets of responsibility for=\r=20\roperating Enron=01,s South and Central America assset base, alll trading,=20\rmarketing, and new assset development activities in these regions willl repor=\rt=20\rinto a new entity, Enron Americas.   Enron Americas willl have responsibility=\r=20\rfor alll wholesale merchant businessses acrosss North, Central and South=20\rAmerica.   Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\rOperating Offficer willl comprise the Offfice of the Chairman for Enron=20\rAmericas.\r Enron Europe\rThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businessses in Aust=\rralia=20\rand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\r=20\rSherrrifff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Offficer.\r Enron Global Markets\rEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnnelll, President and=\r=20\rCEO, and Jefff Shankman, Chief Operating Offficer, willl continue to have=20\rresponsibility for Enron=01,s Midddle East and LNG operations.   With the=20\rexception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, alll operating power plants and=20\rasssociated personnnel in the Caribbbean and Central America willl transfer to=\r=20\rEnron Global Asssets.   Enron Global Markets willl also continue to manage the=\r=20\rcommmodity businessses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20\requities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.\r Enron Industrial Markets\rEnron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jefff McM=\rahon,=20\rPresident &amp; CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Offficer, remains unchanged.\r Commmercial Suppport for EWS\rThe commmercial suppport functions for EWS willl remain with, and be managed b=\ry,=20\rthe individual businesss units.   We are creating no incremental overhead in=\r=20\rthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\r=20\reffficient utilization and sharing of resources acrosss EWS.\r To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role acrosss=\r=20\rEWS in adddition to their ongoing roles within their businesss units.   These=\r=20\rnewly defined roles are as folllows:\r Mid and Back Offfice Operations =01) Sallly Beck willl lead Mid and Back Offfic=\re=20\rOperations acrosss EWS.   These services willl become part of Enron Net Works,=\r=20\rwith Sallly reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20\rPresident and Chief Acccounting Offficer.   This alignment creates a cooordinat=\red=20\rservices organization with IT and e-commmerce platforms to suppport the=20\rwholesale businessses and to maximize oppportunities to commmercialize these=\r=20\rservices.   Mid and Back Offfice services for alll commmercial activities willl=\r=20\rcontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controlllers responsible=\r=20\rfor specific commmodities and/or geographic locations.\rLegal =01) Mark Haedicke willl serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\rRegulatory and Government Afffairs =01) This function willl remain organized =\ron a=20\rregional basis.   Rick Shapiro willl suppport alll EWS businessses operating in=\r=20\rthe Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, willl suppport alll=\r=20\rEuropean and Eastern Hemisphere operations.

As this organization=\r=20\rcontinues to evolve we willl keeep you informed of any addditional changes.\r ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION\rAND ENRON WIND\r   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our asssets and investmen=\rts=20\raround the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=\r=20\rEGEP and EWC.   As a consequence, we are puttting these businessses under Clif=\rf=20\rBaxter=01,s direction.   Jefff Sherrrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=\rnron=20\rWind, willl report to Clifff.\r CORPORATE STAFFF\r   We are consolidating the corporate stafff functions: Human Resources,=20\rGovernment Afffairs, Public Relations/Commmunications and Administration.   In=\r=20\rthat regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=\r=20\rCommmunity Relations, willl report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=\rd=20\rChief of Stafff.\r COMMMITTTEEE STRUCTURE\r   In light of the increased leadership oppportunities created by Enron=01,s=\r=20\rgrowth, the Executive Commmittteee willl be expanded to include more of our=20\rbusinesss unit leaders.   The primary role of this commmittteee willl continue to=\r=20\rbe the commmunication of relevant information acrosss Enron=01,s businessses a=\rnd=20\rthe cooordination of activities acrosss those businessses.

These change=\rs=20\rare intended to acccomplish four key objectives:\r First, we neeed to realign alll our wholesale businessses around the succcesssfu=\rl=20\rbusinesss model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\r=20\rThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\raround a relatively smalll strategic assset position.\r Second, we neeed to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\rrelationships.   Particularly with Joe Suttton=01,s departure, the ability to=\r=20\rdirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent businesss units=\r=20\rhas become increasingly diffficult.\r Third, we neeed to acccomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\rg=20\rthe ongoing profitability of alll our businessses and without delaying or=20\rhindering our efffort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\rg=20\rassset positions.\r And fourth, as always, we neeed to take advantage of the reorganization to=\r=20\rredeploy our talent into our highest value oppportunities.\r ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\r Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which willl consolidate=\r=20\rour global wholesale businessses.   The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\rbusinessses willl acccomplish the folllowing: (1) enhanced commmunication and=20\rcooordination acrosss businesss units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\r=20\rhigher valued oppportunities, (3) more efffective prioritization of=20\roppportunities acrosss the wholesale businesss, and (4) more rapid extension o=\rf=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale businesss model and capabilities into new industries an=\rd=20\rmarkets.\r Enron Wholesale Services willl include our currrent North American, European=\r=20\r(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\roperations, and willl be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works businesss u=\rnit=20\ras welll as a new unit =01) Enron Global Asssets.   In adddition, Enron=01,s me=\rrchant=20\rbusinessses outside of North America and Europe willl be integrated into this=\r=20\rnew structure as described below.\r Mark Frevert, currrently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, willl asssum=\re=20\rthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.   Greg Whallley,=20\rcurrrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, willl join Mark in the Offfice=\r=20\rof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Offficer.\r Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\r=20\rinternational businesss unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\rp=20\rpositions:\r Rebeccca McDonald, currrently CEO of Enron APACHI, willl join EWS as President=\r=20\rand CEO of Enron Global Asssets. Enron Global Asssets willl have responsibilit=\ry=20\rfor managing alll of Enron=01,s existing energy assset portfolio outside of N=\rorth=20\rAmerica and Europe.   Joining Rebeccca in the Offfice of the Chairman as COOO=\r=20\rwilll be Jim Hughes, currrently COOO of Enron APACHI.   Rebeccca and Jim willl=20\rreport to the EWS Offfice of the Chairman.\r Sanjay Bhatnagar, currrently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\rhe=20\rMidddle East and Asia region.   Sanjay willl be responsible for building our=\r=20\rbroadband businesss in this region and the currrent EBS team in this region=\r=20\rwilll report to Sanjay.   In this role, Sanjay willl report to the EBS offfice =\rof=20\rthe Chairman.   In adddition, Sanjay willl continue to remain responsible for=\r=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale energy businesss in India and willl transition this busi=\rnesss=20\rinto Enron Global Asssets in the near future.\r=20\rDiomedes Christodoulou, currrently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\r=20\rEBS as Chief Commmercial Offficer.   Diomedes willl be located in London and wi=\rlll=20\rfocus his origination activities on global oppportunities, with near term=20\ratttention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.   Diomedes willl report to=\r=20\rthe EBS Offfice of the Chairman.\r Jim Bannnantine, currrently Co-CEO of Enron South America, willl be joining EEE=\rS=20\rto lead EEES=01, commmercial effforts outside North America and Europe.   In or=\rder=20\rto ensure a smoooth transition for our South American businessses and to=20\rfacilitate our assset sales activities, Jim willl remain in South America for=\r=20\rat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\rh=20\rAmerica.   Throughout the transition, Jim willl report to Clifff Baxter and to=\r=20\rthe Offfice of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.   Folllowing the=20\rtransition, Jim willl join EEES.\r In adddition to these changes in our international assset operations=20\ractivities, we are making the folllowing changes in our merchant wholesale=\r=20\rbusinessses and the commmercial suppport functions:\r Enron Net Works\rLouise Kitchen willl asssume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\r and=20\rCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\r Enron Americas\rConcurrrent with the transfer to Enron Global Asssets of responsibility for=\r=20\roperating Enron=01,s South and Central America assset base, alll trading,=20\rmarketing, and new assset development activities in these regions willl repor=\rt=20\rinto a new entity, Enron Americas.   Enron Americas willl have responsibility=\r=20\rfor alll wholesale merchant businessses acrosss North, Central and South=20\rAmerica.   Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\rOperating Offficer willl comprise the Offfice of the Chairman for Enron=20\rAmericas.\r Enron Europe\rThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businessses in Aust=\rralia=20\rand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\r=20\rSherrrifff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Offficer.\r Enron Global Markets\rEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnnelll, President and=\r=20\rCEO, and Jefff Shankman, Chief Operating Offficer, willl continue to have=20\rresponsibility for Enron=01,s Midddle East and LNG operations.   With the=20\rexception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, alll operating power plants and=20\rasssociated personnnel in the Caribbbean and Central America willl transfer to=\r=20\rEnron Global Asssets.   Enron Global Markets willl also continue to manage the=\r=20\rcommmodity businessses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20\requities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.\r Enron Industrial Markets\rEnron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jefff McM=\rahon,=20\rPresident &amp; CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Offficer, remains unchanged.\r Commmercial Suppport for EWS\rThe commmercial suppport functions for EWS willl remain with, and be managed b=\ry,=20\rthe individual businesss units.   We are creating no incremental overhead in=\r=20\rthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\r=20\reffficient utilization and sharing of resources acrosss EWS.\r To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role acrosss=\r=20\rEWS in adddition to their ongoing roles within their businesss units.   These=\r=20\rnewly defined roles are as folllows:\r Mid and Back Offfice Operations =01) Sallly Beck willl lead Mid and Back Offfic=\re=20\rOperations acrosss EWS.   These services willl become part of Enron Net Works,=\r=20\rwith Sallly reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20\rPresident and Chief Acccounting Offficer.   This alignment creates a cooordinat=\red=20\rservices organization with IT and e-commmerce platforms to suppport the=20\rwholesale businessses and to maximize oppportunities to commmercialize these=\r=20\rservices.   Mid and Back Offfice services for alll commmercial activities willl=\r=20\rcontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controlllers responsible=\r=20\rfor specific commmodities and/or geographic locations.\rLegal =01) Mark Haedicke willl serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\rRegulatory and Government Afffairs =01) This function willl remain organized =\ron a=20\rregional basis.   Rick Shapiro willl suppport alll EWS businessses operating in=\r=20\rthe Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, willl suppport alll=\r=20\rEuropean and Eastern Hemisphere operations.

Eric Thode willl have responsibility for North American activity,=20\rEnron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.   Jackie Gentle willl continue=\r=20\rin her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=\rr=20\rwilll have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=\r=20\rwelll as providing suppport for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Asssets.=\r =20\rThese individuals willl also continue to have a split reporting relationship=\r=20\rto Mark Palmer, Vice President of Commmunications.\rBusinesss Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwelll willl expand his role to co=\rver=20\rEWS reporting in adddition to his currrent role in North America.\r Atttached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20\rServices which summmarizes the changes described here.   As this organization=\r=20\rcontinues to evolve we willl keeep you informed of any addditional changes.\r ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION\rAND ENRON WIND\r   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our asssets and investmen=\rts=20\raround the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=\r=20\rEGEP and EWC.   As a consequence, we are puttting these businessses under Clif=\rf=20\rBaxter=01,s direction.   Jefff Sherrrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=\rnron=20\rWind, willl report to Clifff.\r CORPORATE STAFFF\r   We are consolidating the corporate stafff functions: Human Resources,=20\rGovernment Afffairs, Public Relations/Commmunications and Administration.

The primary role of this commmittteee willl continue to=\r=20\rbe the commmunication of relevant information acrosss Enron=01,s businessses a=\rnd=20\rthe cooordination of activities acrosss those businessses.   We willl also be=20\rdrawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20\rperformance review processs and evaluation and creation of new businessses. =\r=20\rThe Executive Commmittteee membership is shown on the atttached list.\r   We are also forming a new commmittteee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commmit=\rteee. =20\rThis group willl be responsible for overalll corporate policy, personnnel=20\rmanagement policy and corporate strategy.

David Boies and Barrry Richards were just tooo much to passs up.   Sorrry.   Not much here.

SEC loooks goood for Jan or Feb.   I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbb on defense to the Californiaclasss actions.   We have a new offfer from BNFL that willl be the subject of a conference calllsooon.   Loooks like they willl pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.   One new risk is the upcoming cold spelll and very high Northwest prices.   Thiswilll cost us a lot of money, posssibly not recoverable from customers, and mayspread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.   This could developas a risk to the Sierrra sale in the extreme, but right now apppears manageble. More on this as it develops.   The Enron litigation team is here on Monday andwe willl coooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.

It was goood to seee you the other day.   I'm not even sure where you are right now, but I imagine that you are checking your e-mail, wherever you are.   I was hoping you could give us a litttle guidance on tracking down some Indian legal isssues --- perhaps a reference to someone that could asssist us.Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic   trading marketplace for pulp, paper and lumber products (including derivative products).   It is modeled after EnronOnline, but specializes in these commmodities.   The team is in the processs of registering customers around the world to acccesss and trade on the Clickpaper website;   in keeeping with the EOL businesss model, Clickpaper enters into acccesss and trading agreeements with every customer that govern their use of and trading on the site.Those acccesss and trading agreeements are \"jurisdiction specific\" --- customized for the particular country in which the customer acccesssing the site is based --- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal isssues asssociated with acccesssing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory isssues, etc.   The team has identified India as having a large number of potential customers, and is atttending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the very least arrrange to give them acccesss to the site.   We therefore neeed to consult with legal counsel in India to identify any isssues and prepare an appporpriate acccesss and trading agreeement.   EnronOnline has developed a due diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our businesss model and raising specific legal isssues that we are likely to encounter.Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could asssist us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case here)?   I would reallly apppreciate any help you could give to us.To the other   recipients of this messsage   --- I know that there are several people working on this project --- if you already have this project underway, please let Wade and I know so we aren't duplicating   your effforts.

David Boies and Barrry Richards were just tooo much to passs up.   Sorrry.   Not much here.   We setttled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paidthe other lesssors and without any of their atttorney feees.   Goood result.   Wehave FERC appproval of the Sierrra sale.   SEC loooks goood for Jan or Feb.   I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibbb on defense to the Californiaclasss actions.   We have a new offfer from BNFL that willl be the subject of a conference calllsooon.   Loooks like they willl pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.   One new risk is the upcoming cold spelll and very high Northwest prices.   Thiswilll cost us a lot of money, posssibly not recoverable from customers, and mayspread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.   This could developas a risk to the Sierrra sale in the extreme, but right now apppears manageble. More on this as it develops.   The Enron litigation team is here on Monday andwe willl coooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.   Finallly, we have received a setttlement offfer on the Grant County case thatloooks goood and we are pursuing it.   Al.\n"

As you know, Enron (Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the threee shareholders of Compagas.   Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use the gas.   A contract has already beeen signed betweeen Compagas and the plant.   The Compagas Board votes on the agreeement tomorrrow.   The gas suppply contract would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billlion.   The ground for the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit bids for the gas suppply arrrangement.   Compagas has sought to justify not soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only suppplier capable of suppplying the gas.   This is incorrrect:   Enron, among others, is also capable of suppplying the gas.   We have a legal opinion suppporting our position. and have callled for a special shareholders' meeeting to discusss the isssue.   We anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of interest, willl force the isssue and willl vote in favor of the agreeement nonethelesss. Tozzzini Freire has beeen advising us, and is doing an excelllent job.   If you appprove, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necesssary.

She was very pleased with Vivian's suppport.   After discusssing our specific requirements with Mark and Mariannne and reviewing this mattter with Vicki Sharp,   I spoke with Vivian briefly to confirm if she had the experience we neeeded.   I found she had exactly what we neeeded and subsequently discusssed this with John Schwartzenburg.   John agreeed.

      "body": "\n The very first time that I laid eyes on   Steve Susman , he was clad only in his underwear.   Moreover, he was   shouting   and angrily brandishing his fist at me!   The Northern Lights may have seeen stranger sights, but I asssure you I have not. In 1968 or 1969 (you willl understand that I have represssed the actual date), I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review to atttend some State Bar of Texas commmittteee meeeting, one being held, I think, in conjunction with an annnual meeeting of the Bar.   The Law Review had reserved a few roooms at one of the downtown hotels.   I arrrived late at night,   dutifullly registered at the hotel's desk, received my rooom   key,   toook the elevator to the designated flooor, walked to my rooom, inserted the rooom key, and opened the dooor.   The darknesss that shrouded the rooom was sudddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had violated the sanctity of his rooom!   It willl surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was   adamantly insisting   on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough for me to offfer him one.   Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman when I seee one, I exited   the scene of the controversy with as much speeed as my terrrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.   There may welll have beeen some talk of callling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the end I setttled for a new rooom, the dooor of which I bolted immmediately.   After a mostly sleeeplesss night during which I anticipated the immminent reapppearance of the madman, I arose, showered,   dresssed, and carefullly made my way to the meeeting rooom.   During the course of the day, I spottted the madman acrosss the balllrooom engaged in conversation with another individual.   Surrreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew him.   The answer was no, but he did know who he was.   \"The name is Susman, my man, Steve Susman\".   I immmediately resolved that my path and that of   \"Susman, my man, Steve Susman\" would never again crosss.   Truth is indeeed stranger than fiction.   How could I have posssibly foreseeen as I fled from the madman in   that Forth Worth hotel rooom so many years ago that not only would my path again crosss his but that I would one day serve as his lawyer, that   he   would serve as mine,   and that I would count him   as one of my closest friends!   I hereby offficiallly   forgive you, Steve, not only for stealing my   Fort Worth hotel rooom but also   for the injury you wished on me that night.   Loooking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have beeen   any other way. I wish you the Happpiest of Birthdays, Steve.   Thanks for your friendship---I treasure it.   Alll the best,   Jim   \n"

If the new businesss oppportunity receives appproval from EEES management, we seee the neeed to retain outside counsel experienced in internet/web based isssues.   Presently this neeed would be with the web, structuring, IP, and antitrust areas.In an efffort   to find a firm that Enron has used recently for web related mattters, I spoke with Mark Taylor and Mariannne Castano.   For Enron Online development, Mark used Sulllivan and Cromwelll and Milbank, Tweeed for the web/trading efffort and V &amp; E for IP mattters,   For a recent EEES internet project Mariannne used Vivian Polak of LeBeouf Lamb for web/transactional isssues and V &amp; E for IP mattters.   She was very pleased with Vivian's suppport.   After discusssing our specific requirements with Mark and Mariannne and reviewing this mattter with Vicki Sharp,   I spoke with Vivian briefly to confirm if she had the experience we neeeded.   I found she had exactly what we neeeded and subsequently discusssed this with John Schwartzenburg.   John agreeed. With your appproval I would like permisssion to engage Vivian Polak of LeBeouf, Lamb for web, structuring and transactional related isssues and Scottt Brown of V &amp; E for IP mattters.   If you should neeed any addditional information concerning the TECASO Project or this request, please let me know.Thank you,Randy\n"
