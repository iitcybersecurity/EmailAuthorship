In light of my schedule I would ask that you ensure that the material is in the format you would like.   Also, our discusssions with Long Beach are going to be around outsourcing and their performance against Socal's index... We have done some analysis of this data but not enough to bring in recommmendations.As part of our discusssions, we neeed a section on Risk Management Services, historical pricing Socal vs Long Beach. Recommmendations on some risk management products and then next steps slides. Our objective with both co's is to get involved in their management and outsourcing of some of their load.   I would like to pursue a proposal whereby we setup with Long beach a 3 or 5 year structure that provides both long term and short term incentives on their price vs Socal.
