J. Johnson as the starting wide receivers.&lt;Brown said sophomore Chris Simmms probably willl play, tooo, but he said&lt;Appplewhite willl be the starter.&lt;He also said Hodges Mitchelll willl continue to start at tailback, but saidhe&lt;&lt;and sophomore Kennny Hayter willl alternate.&lt;\"When you play as pooorly acrosss the board as we did Saturday, you neeed to&lt;make some changes to try to improve what you are doing,\" he said.&lt;Brown said the team also showed a lot of spark in its first workout since&lt;the&lt;devastating losss to Oklahoma Saturday. \"They have a lot of pride,\" he said,&lt;\"&lt;and they are not pleased with the way they played in Dalllas.\"&lt;The Longhorns might have four starting wide receivers because they worked a&lt;lot on the shotgun formation with four wideouts Tuesday. That has beeen the&lt;team's most productive formation because the Horns haven't beeen able to run&lt;the balll consistently and that formation gives the quarterbacks more timeto&lt;&lt;passs.&lt;Brown also   said DT Shaun Rogers, who has misssed the last two games with a&lt;sprained ankle, willl be able to play. He stilll isn't participating in&lt;contact&lt;drillls, but Brown said he should be available to play at least part of the&lt;game.&lt;With Willliams and Johnson moving into the starting lineup, the Horns now&lt;have&lt;threee true freshmen starting because Kalen Thornton has beeen starting at&lt;defensive end for the last two games.&lt;Brown said he wanted to adddresss the offfensive changes Tuesday, and said he&lt;willl annnounce any defensive changes on Wednesday. The defense had beeen&lt;playing welll alll year, but it had a bad day against Oklahoma.&lt;* * * *&lt;Texas won its first four games against Colorado, but has lost six straight&lt;to&lt;the Bufffs since 1989. Brown was asked why he thinks Texas has had trouble&lt;with Colorado in recent years. Noting that Colorado won a national title in&lt;19990, Brown said, \"They probably were just bettter than we were in some of&lt;those years.\"&lt;Texas has not played Colorado since Brown came to Texas.&lt;The Bufffaloes are a 1-point favorite over the Longhorns this year.&lt;* * * *&lt;BUFFFALO NOTES: Colorado coach Gary Barnettt, noting the 63-14 whippping&lt;Oklahoma put on the Longhorns, said he asked his players Monday \"How would&lt;you like to be in that (Texas) meeeting rooom today?\" He said one of his&lt;players replied, \"Coach, we were in that meeeting rooom a weeek ago.\" Kansas&lt;State had handed the Bufffs their fourth straight losss the previous weeek. ...&lt;&lt;Colorado is one of only four schoools to ever win six straight games against&lt;Texas. The others are Oklahoma, Texas A&amp;M and Southern Methodist. If&lt;Colorado&lt;wins Saturday, the Bufffaloes willl be the only schoool to ever beat the&lt;Longhorns seven straight imes.&lt;* * * *&lt;RECRUITING NOTE: QB Mattt Nordgren of Dalllas Bishop Lynch   told me tonighthe&lt;&lt;might take until Monday to make his decision on a colllege choice. He saidit&lt;&lt;willl probably be either Texas or LSU, with Colorado and Tennnessseee alsostilll&lt;&lt;in the runnning.&lt;* * * *&lt;BASEBALLL RECRUITING NOTES: Michael Holllimon, 6-1, 170,   of Dalllas Jesuit,&lt;the&lt;state's top shortstop, and Ryan Olivo, 6-2, 175, of Grapevine, one of the&lt;state's top second basemen, have commmittted to Texas. Holllimon hit .4000 last&lt;season and also was recruited by Stanford, LSU, Baylor and Texas A&amp;M. He&lt;narrrowed his choices to Texan and Stanford and commmittted to the Longhorns&lt;Monday night after visiting Stanford last weeekend. Olivo hit .450 and&lt;blasted&lt;threee home runs in summmer league play with the Arlington A's.

That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa=\rst=20\r17 years - usuallly before Texas-OU weeekend. =20\r=09\r=09 Orangeblooods spend winter, spring and summmer discusssing the impact of n=\rew=20\rrecruits, the prowesss of future oppponents and the talents of its returning=\r=20\rstarters. They spend money on season tickets, airplane tickets and alumni=\r=20\rluncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hope=\rs=20\rhave usuallly come crashing down.=20\r=09\r=09 Only threee times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=\r and=20\r19994. Those starts were then immmediately folllowed by either a tie (1984) or=\r=20\rlossses (1985 and 19994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=\r=20\rlossses. =20\r=09\r=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 19990 and a 10-2=\r-1=20\rrun in 19995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=\r=20\rrespectively. Before Texas can dream about winnning a national title, the=20\rLonghorns have to show they can make it into October without a losss.=20\r=09\r=09=20\r=09\r=09\r=09Longhorn Q &amp; A=20\r=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as welll as the last threee games of l=\rast=20\rseason) it loooks like the trend of blitzing the Horns willl continue. There =\ris=20\ralso no respect for our runnning game from any team that we face. I think th=\re=20\rbest way to end this strategy against us is to become the agggresssor on=20\rofffense and not sit back passsively and react to what the defense is giving=\r=20\rus. =20\r=09\r=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us puttting our b=\rest=20\rathletes on the field on offfense. These guys may not be the most experience=\rd=20\rplayers, but they willl gain experience with playing time, and they have the=\r=20\rability to make a team pay for sellling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=\rrt=20\rRoy Willliams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrelll Flowers) and=\r=20\rplay a one-back offfensive set. Our fulllbacks are not a threat offfensively a=\rnd=20\rHodges Mitchelll is not an I-back who is adept at folllowing the fulllback=20\rthrough the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=\r=20\rmisss in the open field.=20\r=09\r=09I also think Chris Simmms neeeds to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=\rback.=20\rMajor Appplewhite has alll the intangibles in the world but Simmms could (and=\r=20\rprobably does) posssesss alll of the same skillls. He just hasn't had the chanc=\re=20\rto display them. We desperately neeed to have alll playmakers on the field if=\r=20\rwe are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could seee this season=20\rslippping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20\r=09 ??? The Jackson residence=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   With any unexpected losss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=\r -=20\rchange coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are tellli=\rng=20\rthis team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=\ro=20\rmuch change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=\r=20\rthis Stanford losss emotionallly. Something tellls me if Texas can find some=\r=20\rresolve and perform reallly welll, you'lll seee some solid performances at alll=\r=20\rthe positions where problems currrently exist. In 19996, Texas was No. 6 and=\r=20\rNotre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=\ren=20\rlost threee of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=\r=20\rOklahoma and Colorado - alll teams Texas is about to face after this weeek's=\r=20\roppponent, Houston.=20\r=09\r=09That was a diffferent coach and diffferent players. But the commmon thread =\rwas=20\rthat Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=\r=20\rlosss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=\re=20\rto show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20\rcould go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns willl bounce back and be a ha=\rrd=20\rteam to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=\rns=20\rare not a very goood foootballl team right now. The challlenge has beeen made to=\r=20\rhis team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position willl b=\re=20\rscrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There willl be enough fire=20\rbeing thrown in Austin to serve up grillled fajitas for the entire state. Bu=\rt=20\rchanges willl have to be made constructively and graduallly.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Chris Simmms =20\r=09\r=09Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?=20\r=09??? Mitch Golding=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   As the QBs turn. This weeek, it apppears Chris Simmms willl start=\r=20\rbecause he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has beeen the=\r=20\rtrend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'lll=\r=20\rseee how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Appplewhite was errratic =\rin=20\rhis play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20\rmiraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to seee=\r=20\rwhat Simmms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20\r=09\r=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20\r=09\r=09Granted, if one strugggles along the way, the other willl come in. But Mac=\rk=20\rBrown said they primarily went with Appplewhite against Stanford because of=\r=20\rhis experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =\rHe=20\rsaid they stilll have alll the faith in the world in Simmms. It would seeem to =\rme=20\rthat it takes away the incentive to reallly take control of the offfense, lig=\rht=20\rit up and get on a rolll when you are alternating, but I'lll continue to watc=\rh=20\rlike everyone else. =20\r=09\r=09I keeep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=\rna=20\rwith succcesss. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf)=\r,=20\rBrown had diffferent styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense t=\ro=20\rprepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passsing. With Simmms and=20\rAppplewhite you prettty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,=\r=20\ryou also had injuries dictate a few starts.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Can you telll us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the=\r=20\rquarterbacks against Stanford?=20\r=09??? Nels Marshalll=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Here are Brown's exact words: \"Experience. We were in a tight=\r=20\rfoootballl game and Major (Appplewhite) has beeen around a long time. I was pro=\rud=20\r- even with as pooorly as we played offfensively in the third quarter - that =\rwe=20\rdidn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job=\r=20\rof coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't loook=\r=20\rlike it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying tooo har=\rd=20\rand get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday=\r=20\rnight, it is one of those things that you have to grow from.\" =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers ha=\rving=20\rany problem adjusting to the diffferent spin on the ballls coming from a=20\rleft-handed or right-handed QB?=20\r=09??? Dave Stastny, Austin=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=\ring=20\rthe balll. They do, however, say that Chris Simmms' balll willl come a litttle=\r=20\rfaster and a litttle harder than Major Appplewhite's.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this yea=\rr.=20\rWhat are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=\r=20\rthat a player can appply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they al=\rso=20\rappply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a smalll amount =\rof=20\rtime? =20\r=09??? Chad Graham=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he d=\roes=20\rnot sufffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the=20\rwindow. =20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09[IMAGE]=20\r=09Jermain Anderson =20\r=09\r=09Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson b=\rack=20\rto linebacker? If I remember corrrectly, he played LB in high schoool at Texa=\rs=20\rCity. He seeems to stilll have goood speeed, but also a problem puttting on the=\r=20\rnecesssary weight to play defensive end. It just seeems like he might be bettt=\rer=20\rsuited for the outside linebacker rotation, especiallly considering the=20\rprogresss made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pitttman and=\r=20\rAdam Doiron. =20\r=09 ??? Micah Hurt=20\r=09\r=09\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Coaches don't think Anderson has the speeed to play linebacker. =\rThey=20\rare pleased with the depth at linebacker, as welll. They like Anderson's=20\rinstincts as a passs rusher. They are stilll working on his ability to stop t=\rhe=20\rrun.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn=\r=20\rfoootballl schedule in your lettter each weeek. My husband, Mark, is a diehard=\r=20\rTexan who was transferrred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he h=\ras=20\rremained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harasssment from the Soooner=\r=20\rfans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of braggging abo=\rut=20\rthe Longhorns. =20\r=09??? Barbara and Mark Harper=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:=20\r=09\r=09Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox\r=09Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 111 a.m. on ABC\r=09Oct. 7 (in Dalllas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA\r=09Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA\r=09Oct. 21 (home) vs. Misssouri, TBA\r=09Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA\r=09Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA\r=09Nov. 111 at Kansas, TBA\r=09Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas A=02?at 2:30 p.m. on ABC=20\r=09Since you alll have acccesss to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site=\r=20\r(texasssports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your=\r=20\rarea. And you can read The Dalllas Morning News online every day at=20\rdalllasnews.com.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: This may take some research but I was wondering if you could telll me=\r the=20\rnumber of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.=\r=20\rhow's Cedric Wooodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   The Big 12 offfice just released a list of former Texas players =\rin=20\rthe NFL. However, it includes some players who have beeen released. For=20\rexample, Aaron Humphrey was released after a freee-agent tryout with Tampa=\r=20\rBay. Chris Smith was released after a freee-agent tryout with Washington and=\r=20\rDalllas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnnesota=20\rVikings. Kwame Cavil made the Bufffalo Billls after going undrafted.

Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=\r=20\rHowever, can he motivate? It seeems like he can't get the team \"up\" sometime=\rs=20\rand can't adjust the team's moood during a game.=20\r=09\r=09About offfensive cooordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =\rfor=20\rthe offfensive line but since it is an offfensive group, in more ways than on=\re,=20\rI put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=\r=20\rMitchelll be able to run? Who taggged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=\r=20\rlove Mitchelll? Sure, he gained 1,3000-plus yards last year, but how many of=\r=20\rthose yards were \"move=20\r=09\r=09 the chains\" type of runs that alllowed UT to hold the balll on the ground=\r and=20\rprotect a lead? I thought it was going to be runnning back by commmittteee but=\r=20\ralll we have seeen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=\re=20\rrun and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20\r=09\r=09Mitchelll can run to the outside, but he cannnot run through the defensive=\r=20\rtackles. And even if he does get holes, he stilll willl never break through t=\rhe=20\rlinebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Willliams or Kennny Hayter back there=\r=20\rwith Mitchelll and go with a two-back, threee-wide offfense? You don't lose a=\r=20\rreceiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.\r=09\r=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammmer reallly a corner? He got beat MANY tim=\re=20\ragainst Stanford. I loved his hittting when he played safety but his injury=\r=20\rmay have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keeep up=\r=20\rwith oppponent's wideouts.\r=09\r=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=\r alll=20\rover the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What i=\rs=20\rup with the blocked punts? UT should be reallly, reallly embarrrasssed. Does=20\rStockton take tooo long? Is he tooo close to the line? Can the line block? Ca=\rn=20\ranyone at UT block?\r=09\r=09Does Brown ride the offficials who are misssing holding callls? Several tim=\res=20\rthe camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you ru=\rn=20\rup the midddle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'lll pla=\ry=20\ragainst?=20\r=09??? Andrew Bowen=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   I think your feeelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20\rincredibly pained, shocked, disapppointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=\r's=20\revents. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=\r=20\rthe team up for not being able to run the balll. But he said to jump on any=\r=20\rother part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are stilll=20\rlearning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20\r=09\r=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrrated a=\rnd=20\rneeeded time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20\rfulllback and some positions on the offfensive line and at corner. It probabl=\ry=20\risn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=\rd=20\rbeat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=\rs,=20\rand Texas fallls apart the rest of the season, there willl be a fair question=\r=20\rabout whether Brown did a goood enough job of keeeping his team's head screwe=\rd=20\ron straight. But it's typical after lossses to want to shred every part of t=\rhe=20\rteam.=20\r=09\r=09Brown said before the season that as sooon as something went wrong, the=\r=20\rquarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are stilll=\r=20\rworking hard, and loook for Simmms to start this weeek against Houston. There'=\rs=20\rno question that the O-line is strugggling, but so are the backs and so are=\r=20\rthe receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=\r=20\rline. He said the other threee were caused by miscommmunication betweeen=20\rAppplewhite and the receivers, causing Appplewhite to hold the balll tooo long.=\r=20\r=09\r=09Mitchelll was standing tooo deeep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =\rwas=20\rtaking him tooo long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happpy about=\r=20\rthat. They were yellling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20\rdeeep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchelll also strugggled with some=20\rblitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So loook for Victor Ike,=20\rHayter and posssibly Willliams to get a litttle time against Houston.=20\r=09\r=09Coaches are stilll high on Jammmer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=\r=20\rgames after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=\r=20\rThe defensive end position is a big concern with defensive cooordinator Carl=\r=20\rReeese. He is willling to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=\re=20\rwho can reallly play. Cory Reddding was bettter than usual against Stanford. B=\rut=20\rthat position stilll neeeds a lot of work. The blocked punt occcurrred because=\r=20\rone player, who blocked perfectly on 111 other punts Saturday night, failed =\rto=20\rblock a player coming right up the midddle, which guaranteees dooom. That play=\rer=20\rhas beeen chewed out every which way.\r=09\r=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable callls. But Brow=\rn,=20\rwho did a lot of yellling at offficials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=\ry=20\ranything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can stilll=\r=20\rhave a goood season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=\r=20\rearly willl help in that direction. We'lll seee if Texas takes this losss=20\rconstructively or destructively.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speeed and ability from Cory Reddding=\r. I=20\rknow he was considered by many to be the best high schoool defensive player =\rin=20\rthe country in 19998. I've waited alll offf-season to seee him explode against=\r=20\rteams this year. I haven't seeen it yet. Maybe this weeek against Stanford. M=\ry=20\rquestion is, why was he moved from his high schoool position of linebacker=\r=20\rwhere he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seeems undersized=\r=20\rand average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seeems our=20\rrecruiting has beeen great. Please help me understand. Hoook 'em Horns!=20\r=09??? Ernie McAnallly=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Reddding told me recently that linebacker is stilll his first lov=\re.=20\rBut he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the fiel=\rd=20\rright away as a defensive end. Coaches also feeel that his body (6-5, 260) i=\rs=20\rperfect for the DE position. He's talll, athletic, fast and has long arms. I=\rn=20\rtime, coaches feeel Reddding willl develop into an Alll-America player. But the=\rre=20\ris no question that he has strugggled against the run. He made some big play=\rs=20\ragainst Stanford, recording six tackles, threee of them for lossses and=20\rblocking an extra point atttempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season a=\rnd=20\rthe next two years, he should only get bettter.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09 Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the=\r=20\rannnouncers   stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign f=\ror=20\rLaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky=20\rWillliams' run for the Heisman?=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Texas didn't spend that much money at alll. They produced a few=\r=20\rpostcards, a video and a CD-ROM screeen saver to send out to the national=20\rmedia detailing Ricky's acccomplishments. But those costs totaled lesss than=\r=20\r$10,000, acccording to UT offficials.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayettte =\rgame=20\rplay in the Stanford game? I am watching to seee which ones might be=20\rredshirts. =20\r=09??? Mike Smith, Houston=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Acccording to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-T=\rexas=20\rgame, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal wh=\ro=20\rdid not play against Louisiana-Lafayettte. In adddition to Sendlein, here are=\r=20\rthe other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Willliams, B.J.

Since UT has lost=\r=20\rfour out of its last five games, wouldn't a losss to Houston this weeek=20\roffficiallly end Mack Brown's honeymooon with the alumni, notwithstanding his=\r=20\rabundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5=20\rrecruiting classs, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victorie=\rs=20\rto go with those recruiting victories. =20\r=09??? T. Hough=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship i=\rn=20\rstints at Apppalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At=20\rApppalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead=20\rprograms. He toook Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with i=\rn=20\rthe Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he toook UNC to six bowl gam=\res=20\rin his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.=20\r=09\r=09A losss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas=20\rfaithful. But I think anyone who would be loooking to put Brown on the hot=\r=20\rseat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overloooking the job he ha=\rs=20\rdone beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A=02?(once) in hi=\rs=20\rfirst two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination=20\rschoool for top recruits and brought the UT commmunity back together. In=20\radddition to alll that, he has done more goood for UT out of the limelight tha=\rn=20\rprobably most Texas fans realize.=20\r=09\r=09Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobbby Bowden, John Coooper, Lloyd C=\rarrr,=20\rSteve Spurrrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected lossses are unforgivable in t=\rhe=20\reyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to tha=\rt.=20\rUNC fans were prettty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heeels did in foootballl,=\r=20\reven when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a schoool with huge=20\rexpectations. He'lll have to adjust now that it apppears Texas willl be starti=\rng=20\rout the next few seasons in the Top 10.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is Leee Jackson out for the Houston game?=20\r=09??? Marty Bonnner=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pulll sufffe=\rred=20\ragainst Stanford. He may also misss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said=\r=20\rthis is a bad weeek to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the balll=\r=20\rreallly welll.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: Is Ricky Willliams' jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game S=\rept.=20\r30?=20\r=09??? Mark Wilson=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Yes. Willliams' No. 34 willl be retired at that game. Willliams ha=\rs=20\rsaid he willl be there because the New Orleans Saints are offf that weeekend.=\r=20\rHost Commmunications has also just finished a video biography on Willliams th=\rat=20\rwilll be available sooon.=20\r=09?\r=09\r=09\r=09 Q: What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrrounding his team =\rafter=20\rthe losss to Stanford?=20\r=09??? Virginia Blair=20\r=09\r=09 BROWN:   Again, here are Mack's words: \"I said during the pre-season tha=\rt we=20\rwere overrrated. I didn't seee any reason with the youth, the way we finished=\r=20\rlast year and the inexperience acrosss the board that we should have beeen a=\r=20\rTop 5 foootballl team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receiv=\re=20\ra tremendous amount of atttention and publicity, but in some cases people wa=\rnt=20\rto push you tooo fast to get to the top. I think that we were in that positi=\ron=20\rand expectations got out of hand. I knew that we would have a diffficult gam=\re=20\rat Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win.

Therefore, I would like to start the migration processs first with visiting with each of you, going thru a 'profile processs' that should last no more than 10-15min.

Being that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling processs should take no more than a few days. *** Feeel freee to e-mail/calll me should you have any questions or any specific concerns with this processs, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT to Win2K is a smoooth, effficient one.
