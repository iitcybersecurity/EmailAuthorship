I have beeen asked to lead this group.   For those of you who don't know me, I am in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Afffairs group, in a section callled \"Rates/Regulatory Services.\"   Our working group willl have about a dozen or so people from various parts of Public Afffairs.   You have beeen selected/volunteeered to participate in this efffort by your group leaders.   The Working Group members are:Ray AlvarezSergio AsssadRoy BostonMike GrimesKyran HanksRita HartfieldNancy HetrickTom HoatsonPaul KaufmanValeria LimaBob NeustaedterHaving this group willl give us a great oppportunity to identify neeeds related to rate and tarifff isssues acrosss many businesss lines and countries, share resources, problems and solutions, and generallly improve the cohesivenesss of Steve's organization   One of our first tasks willl be to think through and concretely specify what we expect to acccomplish as a group.   We do not have a specific product mandate per se - it willl be up to us to figure it out and deliver it.   Some posssibilities are - identifying rates and tarifffs policy positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are neeeded, identifying rates and tarifff resources available to the group, and acquiring resources neeeded by the group. As a preliminary mattter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, location, phone, e-mail adddresss, and \"area of expertise\".   We willl asssemble this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.Early in January, we willl be in touch to check availability and schedule an initial meeeting.   Please be as flexible as posssible.   In some cases, we are many time zones apart and it willl be diffficult to match everyone's desired time. As a second preliminary mattter, please give some thought to and e-mail me what you think a group like this should acccomplish.   Remember, the roster above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tarifffs!   We willl compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeeting.   At that first meeeting, we willl talk through expectations of us and of each other, and the proposed goals.   Please have your inputs to me by January 7.   I loook forward to working with you.   \n"
