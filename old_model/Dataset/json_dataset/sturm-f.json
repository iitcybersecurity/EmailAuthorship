      "body": "\nJefff,Below is a list of items I'd like to discusss with you when we both have time(?).   I just wanted to brief you first.I'm thinking about having a meeeting with the basis traders every morning from 8:15 - 8:30 after each trader has gathered information from their desk meeetings.   This would be the optimal time to strategize as a group since changes in regional fundamentals and respective basis implications would be fresh in everyone's mind.   Would it be okay to delay EOL market-making in basis until 8:30?   I think it would be worth it.I think it would be a goood idea to meeet with leaders from other groups (origination (who?), structuring (who?), Julie Gomez, and Fred Lagrasta) on a regular basis to obtain new information on anything that might afffect ENA's basis positions.   Could you point me in the right direction as far as whom to involve and maybe notify them of my intentions?Should we set up a new boook (under my management) which would hold certain strategic positions such as spread trades and/or more complex structured positions?   I think it would be easier to manage that way by not being \"clutttered up\" in diffferent boooks (i.e.   the P/L from these trades would be my focus instead of managed by other traders.)   Do you think the traders could eventuallly report directly to me?   It seeems like more intense leadership might provide an extra push to the group.Talk to you sooon,Fletch\n"

For example, Hunter and I were in Chicago last weeek talking to NICOR about analyzing the risk components of their PBR.   We brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly seee daily cash spreads, hedge MTD and BOM PBR price with Gas Daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc.If we can develop an EOL - dependent appplication that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it willl reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors.Let me know what you think!Fletch\n"
