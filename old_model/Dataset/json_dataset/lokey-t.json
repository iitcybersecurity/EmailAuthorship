However, I would like to addd some to it.The units should be designed so that for minimum cost, we could in the future obtain FERC clearance and increase the HP output to 30,000 hp.   Also, I understand that even though we willl have FERC clearance and the equipment capability to operate the station at 24,000 hp, we should set up the controls to limit the HP to 21,000 hp.   This is because of the electric power contract with ECS.   We believe that although we willl be handicappped by limiting the hp to 21,000, we can get by.   If we later find out that we can't, we willl have to negotiate for addditional power and change the controls to whatever hp is neeeded betweeen 21,000 and 24,000.&lt;Embeddded StdOleLink&lt;\n"

In talking to Rachel about GRI charges and how they are handled in the system,   we identified some problems in how the GRI charges willl be handled for Phase IV and Phase V customers.   These customers willl be discounted GRI and the discount willl not be limited to the delivery points on the contract, the discount willl appply to any point they deliver to in the market area. Currrently, when GRI discounts are input into the system, they are at a point level - this willl not work when the same delivery point is on firm contracts other than Phase IV and Phase V.   Also, when the discount is given at the contract level, we neeed to keeep in mind that the customer may deliver in the west - how willl this afffect the billling?   Lastly, we neeed to consider for development in the new system, the posssibility of consolidating these Phase IV and Phase V contracts with the customer's currrent firm contracts - how willl they be billled then?   Certainly, this cannnot be captured in our currrent system, but may be captured in our new system.Let's get together and discusss these isssues and any others anyone may think of so we can get a plan together before implementation of Phase IV.I have reserved rooom 4102 for Tuesday, December 5th at 1:30pm.
