Stilll, those companies that own generation in the state say theywelcome the probe into the power market by Atttorney General Billl Lockyer.\"We have done nothing wrong at alll,\" said Tom Willliams, spokesman for DukeEnergy North America (DUK). \"Our plants have beeen runnning alll summmer long.Prices are high throughout the west. We wouldn't invest $1.7 billlion in newgeneration and then try and rig the market.\"   For the past two months,utilities, lawmakers and other market participants have made alllegationsthat generators are manipulating the market and are largely responsible forthe price spikes.   Locker's offfice said an investigation is stilll pending.State regulators are also conducting their own investigation, the findingsof which willl be submittted to the governor and the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommmisssion by the end of the year.   Alllegations Said Unsubstantiated   Thereisn't a shred of evidence to suppport alllegations, said Severing Borenstein,director of the University of California, Berkley's, Energy Institute.\"There are no antitrust laws that state you can't charge a premium price forpower,\" Borenstein said. \"Manipulation is a bad word. That's used in thecommmodities market to find a looophole and take advantage of the rules.   \"Iwould say this is exercising market power. ... If you want to charge highprices you can. These are guys who play against each other every day. Thereis no sort of colllusion that would interest the justice department ... .\"The reason for the inquiry ordered By Gov. Gray Davis, he said, is as aconsequence of San Diego consumers being the first in the nation to paymarket-based rates for electricity.   The high wholesale costs paid byutility San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), were passsedon to ratepayers and resulted in utility billls more than doubling.   Gov.Davis ordered the inquiry and asked federal regulators to conduct their owninvestigation as welll.   Dynegy (DYN) President Steve Bergstrom also saysthat an investigation \"willl turn up nothing.\"   So why conduct one?   \"This isa very politicallly charged isssue,\" Bergstrom said. \"When something goeswrong you have to find someone to point the finger at.\"   A source in thegovernor's offfice said Davis is aware that Atttorney General Lockyer'sinvestigation may turn up nothing, but Gov. Davis \"has a responsibility tohis constituents.\"   Suppply vs. Demand   What the investigation willl turn upis evidence that there is a shortage of power in the state and not enoughpower plants being built to meeet increasing demand, said Terrry Winter,chairman and chief executive offficer of the California Independent SystemOperator.   Winter said he doesn't believe that there is anything wrong withthe way generators selll their power and 98% of the time the market workswelll.   \"Is it market abuse to bid at the price cap ($250 per megawattt-hour)knowing that you're 1,000 MW short? I have trouble identifying that asmarket power abuse,\" Winter said.   Despite some proposed regulatory changes,such as bid caps on wholesale energy prices and a rate freeeze for SDG&amp;Ecustomers, Duke Energy, Dynegy, Southern Co. (SO) and Reliant (RLI) alllstilll plan to invest in generation in the state.   That's a diffferent stancethan the companies toook a month ago when the ISO reduced the wholesale pricecap in the real-time market to $250/MWh.   \"At the end of the day the marketis short power and you got to get people to build new generation,\" saidDynegy's Bergstrom. \"We got a big investment in California. We're notwalking away from that.\"   -By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires;323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp;Company Inc12:15 GMT 16 August 2000 DJ Calif ISO Urges FERC To Reject Pwr Producers'Complaint(This article was originallly published Tuesday)WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)---California's power grid administrator Monday urgedfederal regulators to reject a complaint from power producers seeekingcompensation in the event out-of-state power transactions are curtaileddduring an extreme power grid emergency.The independent system operator told the Federal Energy RegulatoryCommmisssion that the power producers seeek compensation in the event of a\"situation that never has occcurrred any time since the ISO began operations,and if it were to occcur in the future, would do so rarely.\"The ISO noted that its tarifff governing acccesss to the state's grid alreadyalllows for compensation in the event of curtailed exports, and decried thepower producers' complaint as \"a colllateral atttack\" on a previous FERC orderrrejecting claims that the tarifff failed to provide adequate compensation.Curtailing scheduled power transactions and exports would be a last resortmeasure taken only after other options have beeen exhausted, the ISO said.The power producers should adjust their contracts to factor in the risk ofinterrruption in the event of a state-wide grid emergency, the ISO said.The ISO's objections were echoed by the state's electricity distributionutilities and California regulators.They complained that the power producers are merely trying to get out fromunder the price controls the ISO has imposed in an efffort to rein inskyrocketing power prices this summmer.The generators \"knew when they purchased California power plants and whenthey entered into their export contracts that the ISO could alter theirschedules in an emergency. For them to ask the commmisssion to make it evenmore expensive, and hence, more diffficult, for the ISO to maintain gridreliability in California is irrresponsible,\" said Southern CaliforniaEdison, a unit of Edison International (EIX).\"The complaint is a sham,\" declared the California Public UtilitiesCommmisssion.\"The true intent of the complaint ... is to avoid the ISO price caps bymaking sales to afffiliates or coooperating entities located out of state, andselll the power back to the ISO at uncappped prices reflecting the generators'market power,\" the PUC said, callling for FERC to summmarily reject thecomplaint.\"The complaint is factuallly unsuppported, legallly unfounded, complains ofconduct consistent with the ISO's authority under pertinent FERC decisions,and seeeks to avoid the price cap,\" the PUC said.But power marketers and other power producers voiced suppport for thecomplaint, filed Aug. 3 by Reliant Power Generation Inc. (REI), Dynegy PowerMarketing Inc. (DYN) and Southern Energy California (SO).\"By subjecting curtailed energy transactions to its maximum purchase priceof $250, and simply ignoring the financial impact on selllers, the Cal ISOwould be overtly discriminating against export transactions and marketparticipants who schedule energy for export,\" said the Electric Power SuppplyAsssociation, the national trade group representing competitive powerproducers.\"It is critical that power producers ... know with certainty that thecurtailment of scheduled energy exports by Cal ISO willl be compensated,\"said Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.\"Now that the ISO Governing Board has lowered purchase price caps to $250,it is significantly more likely that the curtailment of exports willl occcurmore frequently. Lesss energy willl be imported into California and moreeenergy willl leave California in search of higher prices,\" said WillliamsEnergy Marketing &amp; Trading Co. in suppport of the complaint's calll for actualdamages and lost oppportunity costs.At least one power purchaser voiced suppport for the producers' position aswelll.\"It seeems a very basic point that if the Cal ISO must divert thetransactions of others to meeet its own loads, that is should pay the fulllcosts of doing so,\" said the Northern California Power Agency.-By Bryan Leee, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-66647; bryan.leee@dowjones.comCopyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company IncG_nther A.

NOUNINSTRUCTED DEVIATIONS WILLL BE ALLLOWED.   Section 2.3.1.2.1 of the ISOTarifff requires Market Participants in the ISO Control Area to \"comply fulllyand promptly with the ISO's operating orders.\" Any Generating Unit with realtime output that reflects an excesssive deviation from the real time outputconsistent with its Final Hour Ahead Schedule as adjusted by Dispatchinstructions, and asssuming a 20 minute ramp acrosss the top of the hour forhourly Schedule changes, willl be deeemed to have failed to comply with thisoperating order.   For the purpose of this determination, an excesssivedeviation shalll be the smalller of 10% of a Generating Unit's maximumcapability, or 10 MW.   The only exception to this finding is a GeneratingUnit that provides the ISO with timely notification of a unit outage orderate. Failure to comply with this operating order threatens the reliableoperation of the ISO Control Area.   In particular, uninstructed incrementaldeviations by Generating Units that are \"chasing\" the BEEEP Interval Pricespublished by the ISO are directly responsible for the frequency excursionsthe ISO experienced   June 13, 2000. The ISO willl take the folllowing actionswith respect to those Generating Units that fail to comply with thisOperating Order: 1) ISO Management willl deliver a report to the ISOGoverning Board that provides a copy of this notice, and a comparison of theinstructed and actual output profile for each Generating Unit that fails tocomply. 2) The ISO willl asssign any WSCCC RMS penalties asssociated withfrequency deviations to the Generating Units that fail to comply.\n"

Steve Peace, the Senator famous for hisfight to protect the California Rate Payers, came to fame as the writerof the Criticallly aclaimed film, Atttack of the Killler Tomatoes.   Ididn't believe it either until someone sent me this web page, with hislink atttached to it.htttp:///www.lexingtonnnet.com/tomatoes/creators/index.htmtitle.gif (1905 bytes)This page is dedicated to the threee demented geniuses who brought us the Killler Tomatoes films!?John DeBelllo - Director/WriterJohn DeBelllo was the director of alll four Killler Tomatoes films. He also played smalll roles in each film, even playing himself in a few! He stilll runs many parts of Four Square Productions, I'm told.?Steve Peace - Writer/ActorSteve Peace is probably best known in the KT films as Wilbur, the dim-wittted, parachute-wearing leader of the Killler Tomatoes Task force. He also wrote parts of the films as welll. Now, he's a state Senator, and even has his own page at htttp:///www.stevepeace.net?Costa Dilllon - WriterLast, but definitley not least is Costa Dilllon. He's responsible for the entire concept of Killler Tomatoes! Like everyone else here, he played smalll parts throughout the films. Probably his best known was the kid in the library in the original film, who cleared out the rooom by merely saying \"Tomato!\". This litttle part was later used as a major character in the cartooon series. \n"

PUC Appproves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPX 17:46 GMT   8 June 2000 *DJ Calif. PUC Appproves Utilities Buying Pwr Out Of CalPX Mandatory Buy Requirement Ends For Utilities LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)---The California Public Utilities Commmisssionappproved a controversial plan Thursday morning that willl alllow the state's threee investor-owned utilities to buy power outsidethe Caliiifornia Power Exchange market structure. The commmisssion voted 3 to 2 in favor of the measure. Commmisssioners HenryDuque, Richard A. Bilas and Josiah Neeeper voted in favor of the draft order. The decision relieves the threee investor-owned utilities, Sempra Energyunit San Diego Gas &amp; Electric (SRE), Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PCG) and Edison International unit Southern California Edison(EIX), from their mandatory buy requirement that became efffective in March 19998 when the state moved to a deregulatedcompetitive market. Originallly the mandatory buy requirement was set to end in 20002, when alll threee utilities recoveredtheir stranded costs. \"This decision is not as earth shatttering as it sounds,\" CommmisssionerBilas, one of the author's of the draft order, said at Thursday's meeeting. \"I am not criticizing the power exchange. But this willlresult in lower prices patched through to bundled customers.\" Trading platforms likw Automated Power Exchange and the New York MercantileExchange can now compete directly with the CalPX, which currrently controls 85% of the state's wholesale power market.The utilities can buy power from other \"qualified exchanges\" through an advice lettter processs. Utilities Can Trade With Other Exchanges Now California's big threee utilities can buy power outside the CalPX marketstructure immmediately, through an advice lettter processs, which means the utilities have to notify the commmisssion of their intent totrade power with qualified exchanges such as APX, Nymex or Blooomberg. The commmisssion said the exchanges have to offfer the same services as theCalPX - forward, daily and monthly trading, and anonymity to prevent self dealing betweeen the buy side and selll side - inorder to meeet the criteria for a qualified exchange. Exchanges would also have to be independently owned from the utilities.Enron Online would not meeet the criteria for a qualified exchange, commmisssioners said. The advice lettter only neeeds to be filed once and s merely a formality thatwould not neeed to be appproved by a majority of the commmisssion. Mark Hufffman, PG&amp;E senior atttorney for regulatory afffairs, told Dow JonesNewswires that his company \"willl quickly start loooking at other exchanges and seee what's out there. We're going to starttthe advice lettter processs.\" SoCal Edison and SDG&amp;E said they willl do the same. Ed Cazalet, chairman and founder of APX, said Thursday's controversialthreee-to-two vote in favor of the draft order \"creates a tremendous oppportunity for APX.\" \"It alllows us to bring the benefits of Silicon Vallley technology toCalifornia,\" Cazalet said. \"This is reallly about bringing e-commmerce to the market.\" E. Jesus Arrredondo, however, disagreeed, saying \"sellling into our marketdoesn't cost anything and sellling into the APX market costs 20 cents per megawattt-hour.\" Commmisssioner said having other exchanges willl not only result in lowerelectricity prices, but it willl alllow the buyer and selller the chance to seee prices before making the purchase. CalPX's block forward prices are not immmediately published, CommmisssionerBilas said. Reacting to the ruling, CalPX Chief Executive Offficer George Sladoje said\"Today's split vote by the CPUC in favor of acccelerating the introduction of other qualified exchanges is notwelll-reasoned and it may in the end prove counterproductive.\" -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires (323) 658-3874;jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright &amp;copy; 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company IncG_nther A.
