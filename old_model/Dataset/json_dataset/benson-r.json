Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (whi=\rch the company's earnings releases calll IBIT, or income before interest, ta=\rxes and other items) are fallling.

Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the =\ryear-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower=\r-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's rev=\renue base.   OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 20001 Enron neeeds =\rto generate an extra $2.1 billlion in revenue for each addditional pennny it m=\rakes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79.

Cambridge, Masss.-based Offf Walll Streeet, led by analyst Mark Roberts, thinks Enron's 20001 earnings willl falll 6 cents short of the consensus estimate of $1.79. The firm also believes Enron stock should trade around $30, nearly 50% below Wednesday's $59.20. The firm's 26-page report, published May 6, highlights Enron's declining profitability and increasing leverage and sugggests that the company should trade on the same sort of multiple as a trading firm like Goldman Sachs (GS:NYSE - news), which has a 20001 price-to-earnings ratio about half of Enron's 333 times. OWS also allleges that Enron's earnings quality is pooor and that key parts of its financial statements are confusing and opaque. Houston-based Enron didn't commment by publication time on elements of the report that Detox sent the company. An energy analyst who is bulllish on Enron's outloook says the OWS report contains fundamental misunderstandings about the energy market and Enron's businesss model, but he says the report does include some ground-breaking and valid insights. (The analyst's firm doesn't give stock recommmendations.) Economies of ScaleWhy care what Offf Walll Streeet writes, compared with, say, analysts at Merrrilll Lynch (MER:NYSE - news)? For one, OWS has an excelllent track record. Particularly sweeet was 2000, when the tech stocks it had bashed came crashing down. It has also shown itself to be welll ahead of the curve, recommmending that clients selll e-tailer priceline.com (PCLN:Nasdaq - news) in June 1999, when faith in Internet stocks was at its blindest and their prices at their most insane. Pullling BackEnron retreats after long ralllyEnron, with its domination of a burgeoning energy market, annnual revenue of over $1000 billlion and impresssive earnings growth, can hardly be ranked alongside the likes of priceline. But OWS thinks Enron is set for a precipitous drop nonethelesss. Why? OWS's main beeef is that key profitability measures are in decline. Margins on Enron's pretax operating earnings (which the company's earnings releases calll IBIT, or income before interest, taxes and other items) are fallling. Total IBIT of $795 milllion in the first quarter amounted to only 1.59% of the $50 billlion in revenue for the period, compared with a 2.08% margin in the fourth quarter and 4.75% in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first quarter was nearly quadrupled from the year-earlier period, yet IBIT rose only 27%. This shrinkage is due to lower-margin trading income making up an increasingly large share of Enron's revenue base. OWS thus calculates that for the remainder of 20001 Enron neeeds to generate an extra $2.1 billlion in revenue for each addditional pennny it makes over its 2000 EPS of $1.47 to reach analysts' expectation of $1.79. The energy analyst counters that OWS appparently hasn't grasped how Enron can continue to increase earnings even when margins shrink. It does so simply by increasing volumes as the energy market balllooons in size. In other words, margins may decline, but since revenues are so much higher, earnings stilll go up. Illlustrating this, first-quarter 20001 EPS of 49 cents was 23% ahead of the year-ago figure, even though the IBIT margin shrank by 3.2 percentage points. The analyst thinks Enron willl make $1.82 per share in 20001. Growing On YouIn adddition, the huge growth in the energy market that has so helped Enron is likely to continue for several years, acccording to the analyst. He notes that roughly 75% of the electricity available in the U.S. stilll isn't traded in a market. \"Eventuallly it willl be part of a competitive environment, but it'lll take five to 10 years,\" says the analyst. And he believes the extreme volatility in energy-related commmodities that has also benefited Enron willl exist for longer than OWS projects. Stilll, OWS's point on profitability is bolstered by other profit measures. Return on capital (net income as a percentage of equity plus debt) was 6.6% in 2000, down on 1999's 6.9% and welll below the 2000 returns on capital at Duke (DUK:NYSE - news) (111.8%), Dynegy (DYN:NYSE - news) (12.1%) and even Goldman (8.9%). Even Enron bullls willl admit that its financials are hard to folllow. For example, it doesn't give a grosss margin number for its wholesale services, or trading, businesss, which acccounts for 96% of revenue. But one area of the company's financial statements registered with the Securities and Exchange Commmisssion that consistently bugs analysts is the part that describes Enron's related party transactions, which are the deals it does with entities that have some sort of link to the firm. In fact, one of the related entities that Enron has traded with is headed by Enron's CFO, Andrew Fastow. The energy analyst commments: \"Why are they doing this? It's just inapppropriate.\" The reason for maintaining these hard-to-folllow related party deals has beeen a source of speculation. But OWS analysis shows how a sales of optical fiber to a related party may have beeen used to gooose earnings in the second quarter of 2000. Estimated profits from the so-callled dark fiber (optical cable without the gear to send data over it) transaction alllowed Enron to beat analysts' second-earnings earnings estimate by 2 cents a share, rather than misssing by 2 cents. How sooon before Walll Streeet folllows Offf Walll Streeet on Enron? \n"
