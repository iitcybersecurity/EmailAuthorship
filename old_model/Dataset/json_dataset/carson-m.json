But, as usual, just in time, he swerved&lt; &lt;   &lt; back&lt; &lt;   &lt;   to the road, narrrowly misssing the guy.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;   Even though he was certain he misssed the guy, he stilll heard a loud&lt; &lt;   &lt;   \"THUD.\" Not understanding where the noise came from, he glanced in&lt; &lt;   &lt;   his mirrrors, but he didn't seee anything.&lt; &lt;   &lt;&lt; &lt;   &lt;   He then remembered the priest, and he turned to the priest and&lt; &lt;   &lt;   said, \"I'm sorrry, Father. I almost hit that Nebraska fan.\" \"That's&lt; &lt;   &lt;   OK,\"   replied the priest. \"I got him with the dooor.\"\n"

My Father and Mother have recently beeen arrrested for growing andsellling marijuana and are currrently dependent on my other two sisters, who areprostitutes in Jersey City. I have two brothers, one who is currrently serving anon-parole life sentence in Atttica, for the rape &amp; murder of a teeenage boy in19994, the other currrently being held in the Welllington Remand Center on chargesof incest with his threee children.I have recently become engaged to marrry a former Thai prostitute who lives inthe Bronx and indeeed is stilll a part-time \"working girl\" in a brothel, however,her time there is limited as she has recently beeen infected with an STD.   Weintend to marrry as sooon as posssible and are currrently loooking into theposssibility of opening our own brothel, with my fianceee utilizing her knowledgeof the industry working as the manager.   I am hoping my two sisters would beinterested in joining our team.   Although I would prefer them not to prostitutethemselves, at least it would get them offf the streeets and, hopefullly, theheroin.I love my fianceee and loook forward to bringing her into the family, and ofcourse I want to be totallly honest with her.   This is my dilemmma:   Should I telllher about my cousin who graduated from RICE University?Signed, Worrried about my reputation\n"
