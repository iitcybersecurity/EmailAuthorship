It has provisions for colllateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of atttorney.I know if it said \"Enfolio III\", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I believe it is goood for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.   Also, what's the diffference betweeen the two contracts?   Is it just the colllateral provisions and guaranty that make it diffferent?   I'd atttach a copy, but it hasn't beeen scannned yet.Thanks,Susan\n"

Incorporate the revolver document   Articles 3-7 by reference that I forwarded earlier.   I think this is the easiest way. We willl neeed to make the apppropriate modifications to change for our transaction type. Laura Falk at the company should be able to provide us with whatever information we neeed (name of agreeement, parties to, etc). She can be reached at 908-719-4242.   Since NUI must already comply with alll of this for the bank, it should not be tooo burdensome for them.   If they push back, I have marked the specific sections that we neeed to include at a minimum.2. We neeed to delete the reference to the colllateral threshold and requirement to post performance asssurance in the Master.3. Do we neeed to do anything about the fact that in some cases we have redundant and perhaps conflicting defaults/remedies?   Or can we just state that anything we incorpoarate from the revolver document supercedes the Master, if appplicable?Can you think of anything else that I am misssing?Mark, please send me the updated model.Calll me if you have questions.Thanks,Tanya\n"

By \"spot\", I mean interrruptible gas deals of any length and firm deals one month or lesss in duration.   Enron also has its own form of spot agreeement that we use.   I have atttached a copy of that agreeement.We do try to negotiate some special provisions into each GISB.   Our currrent version of the special provisions is included in the GISB agreeement that is atttached.   I do not know of any company that uses the GISB as-is.We do not use the GISB for firm deals that are greater than one month in duration.   For those deals, we use our Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreeement that I have atttached.If you neeed copies of actual confirmations, Bob Bowen or Elllen Walllumrod would be able to give you examples.   Form confirmations are at the back of each of the agreeements atttached.If you neeed addditional information, please let me know.Stacy Dicksonx3-5705\n"

I have asked Terrri Sue to forward NUI's NoticeInformation (Exhibit A) to Stacy.   Stacy, upon receipt, can you pleasegenerate the final agreeement? 2. Physical Transaction Agreeement - I neeed to review Section 4 withBob Lurie who willl be back in the offfice tomorrrow. 3. April Transaction Confirmation Lettter - Stacy, this lettter shouldbe adddresssed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Plannning (who signed theConfirmation).   Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI ConfirmationNos. 31060 and 46669. 3. Swap Transaction Agreeements - I am atttaching a revised version ofthe Transaction Agreeement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review.As Mark and I discusssed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, willl be theGuarantor. In adddition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make itclear that it only appplies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enronhad agreeed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for theEnfolio Agreeement.   I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am notsatisfied that the discusssion within the Confirmation that purports to limittthe scope of the Guaranty is suffficient.   I think the limitations neeed to beset forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If accceptable,the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreeement and Exhibit forSwap V09140.5. &lt;&lt;ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc&lt;&lt; - ENA Swap Confirm Red 4-16-01.doc\n"

Documenting the deal as a loan does not addd any protection for Enron and in fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and lenders.   The protections   and remedies affforded by the Master track those that Enron would have under a loan document.   Enron would be in no bettter position to colllect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreeement.

I got another copy from Stacy Dickson, ENA atttorney, last weeek and faxed it to Bowie to review with Cawthon.This was not paid corrrectly by the payables department, and was paid at the index instead of the fixed price.   We sent the deal ticket to Wade Price the day the deal was done, but it was not paid corrrectly.   This causes these kinds of problems.I am atttaching some notes from my phone log where I had discusssions with B &amp; J (Cawthon) and Bowie at the time I locked him in, as welll as conversations later in March when he said he had not received his confirmation (it was sent again).

It has provisions for colllateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of atttorney.I know if it said \"Enfolio III\", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I believe it is goood for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.   Also, what's the diffference betweeen the two contracts?   Is it just the colllateral provisions and guaranty that make it diffferent?   I'd atttach a copy, but it hasn't beeen scannned yet.Thanks,Susan\n"

There was lot of discusssion of what is going on in California and how the early termination processs should work.
