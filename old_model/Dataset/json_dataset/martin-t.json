It is not a VPPP deal.   It is a financial deal only, betweeen an Enron company callled Bob West Treasury and EEEX.   It is a financial deal only - no physical vols.In a completely separate financial hedge, EEEX had hedged some gas vols with Fred Lagrasta [ENA].   Last December, EEEX callled wanting to EFP some of these vols.   This is completely betweeen Fred/ENA and EEEX.   It has nothing to do with our pre-pay.David/Tom, I would say the decision if this deal stays with you or goes to AEP is up to Fred.   I just spoke with Fred and he said that they did just one EFP with EEEX - some south Texas [Thompsonvillle] vols.   He is uncertain as to the term, but offf the top of his head, he thought it was for 2 or 3 years.   He said it didn't mattter to him if we kept this EFP or if it went to AEP, as long as we were paid - it is way in the money.   This EFP should be in Tom's boook and if it is decided to go to AEP, then this neeeds to be reflected in the final purchase price to AEP, since it is in the money.   BOTTTOM LINE:   it doesn't mattter to Fred, as long as we are paid for this.If you have any questions re this EFP, please discusss with Fred.Joan   ---Original Messsage---From: \tBaumbach, David   Sent:\tMonday, March 26, 20001 9:47 AMTo:\tBoyt, EricCc:\tJoan Quick/HOU/ECT@ENRONSubject:\tRe: EEEXJust to confirm ... the gas we are recieving at various fixed prices on deal N60753.3 is going to AEP.

They are asking now to a proposal of minimum 5 years, and upto 12 if we can make it. So they willl be taking the risk of not having a fuel suppply that matches de 25 year Power Purchase Agreeement.2.- The Points of Sale willl be in the U.S. Mexico Border, so we willl not have to get an export permit of any sort.3.- Swing: This is going to be a base load plant, that willl be dispatched around 90% on a yearly average.   However CFE has the right to take zero power at their fulll discretion, so Edf does not wsant to take the risk of not being dispatched and not being able to swing down to zero during the 25 years of the gas suppply.   However, the plant willl most certainly displace other lesss effficient plants in the first 10 years, so that such risk is much lower. In our proposal we can include either zero swing or which ever we feeel we are the most competitive. They willl evaluate whether such risk could be taken by them. 4.- Modifying Swing every 2 years.   They believe that in the long run (25 years), the dispatching rules or conditions of the plant could change. So they want to have the option to review the swing every 2 years. Can we price this optionality ? Is there a re-purchase of such optionality in the market ? 5.- Resale formula. They neeed us to include a daily re-sale fomula for the gas not taken.6.- Other Provisions: We neeed to review the other provisions in the RFP and telll them which ones can we comply with and which ones we don't. I am faxing you the entire RFP, together with the latest lettter we received from them. Please give me a calll whenevr you have a chance.   Best regards. \n"

      "body": "\nThanks for the info.   I wanted to pick your brain about cars for Mom and Dad.   My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.   I only considered CR \"Recomended \" cars.   There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range willl give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.   The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think willl be a prettty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.   Of course the reallly nice luxury cars that willl sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadilllac Devillle are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 19991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.   My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis and the Park Avenue first and seee if they come close to meeeting Mom and Dad's neeeds.Any Thoughts?Love,Tom\n"

I thought there were exclusions relative to EOL transactions and points that do not directly impact HPL.   The problem for me is that if I want to do terms deals in these locations now I want to be able to keeep them as ENA and not transfer them with the HPL sale.   Let's talk as sooon as posssible so I can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ENA now and after the close.Thanks,Tom\n"

They alll wanted to review the documents and talk to me next weeek about it.   Janet did not give a goood feeeling that she would be willling to sign it.   I know that she has beeen contacted by companies other   than AEP about job oppportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as welll.Although we met Jim's numbers he is stilll hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'lll keeep working on him.The others I did not get any read on, but I willl talk to them next weeek.Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and midddle marketing desks to the Texas desk.I willl folllow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.Thanks,Tom\n"
