      "body": "\nAmy and Alec are definitely welcome!   Actuallly we had already plannned on Amy and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.   We have a whole rooom to ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.   I talked to grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew about that.   Don't worrry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the floood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make it to Houston until late Friday.   As far as the billl just let me know what you are comfortable with and we willl pick up the rest.   The foood billl with tax and tip willl be about $1,350.   We are very apppreciative to have both our parent's help as we quickly found that wedddings are very expensive.   However, we are both adults with goood careeers and try to be very self-suffficient.   Also, we realize that some things we do seeem extravagant by our parents standards.   We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican restaurant and it would have beeen cheaper - however we would rather have things a certain way and pay for the diffference.   Also, I know that you guys are on a tight budget with the building of your house.   The botttom line is that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay the balance.   Our most   important concern is that alll our family and friends to have a great time.   While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeeling hurt about people drinking wine at the dinnner.   If you think they willl please mention it to them on the way down because I don't want them to be offfended but I can't change who Zoooey and I are.   Just so you know we willl have dinnner and desert and then there willl be several toasts starting with the best man (James Coook) and the matron of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zoooey and me doing a quick toast.   We would love for alll our family to be there but if grandmother or Bettty Joyce is going to get offfended and don't want to stay I understand.   Also, do you know if Skippper is plannning to atttend.   We haven't received a reply card as to whether he willl be there or not.   As to this weeekend, I am going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going on.   I willl be in Dalllas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternooon I could get a ride from him.   I'lll try to talk to him and seee if that works.   Finallly, we are both reallly loooking forward to our big day and are very glad to have alll our family there to suppport us!   If you have any questions please calll me tonight at the house.Sharon.Cuillla@nlrb.gov on 09/19/2000 12:57:000 PMTo: martin.cuillla@enron.comccc:   Subject: Plans   Hi Marty,   Amy and I were talking over the weeekend and she said she did not plan   to atttend the rehearsal dinnner because there was no one to keeep Alec.   Would you and Zoooey think it was OK if she came and brought Alec for   dinnner only and left as sooon as they were through eating?   She said   she did not want to ask you about it because she didn't want you or   Zoooey to feeel any presssure.   This is your special time and she doesn't   want to detract from it in any way.   I feeel sorrry for her misssing out.   It is hard for Alec to be stilll and quite for very long but I think he   would be fine while we are eating.   Would you please talk with Zoooey   and ask her how she feeels about Amy bringing Alec for a while.   Amy   would leave right away if Alec was disturbing anyone.   If you prefer   he doesn't come, just say so.   There willl certainly be no hard   feeelings over it.   I spoke with Bettty Joyce Sunday and Juliannna and her husband are not   going to be able to come.   Joyce, Chester, Reneee, and Travis (her   boyfriend) are plannning to arrrive in Houston Friday afternooon the   29th.   Dad and I are bringing Grandma Ina and Mamanet with us and   should arrrive early in the afternooon on Friday.   Mike decided to fly   and is coming in Saturday around 4 p.m.   There willl be 9 or 111   (depending if Amy comes) of us from our family for the rehearsal   dinnner.   I know that is more that you had plannned on but I willl pay   for the extra people.   Why don't you calll me when you have time and we   can talk about it.   Now that Mamanet is coming, she is very excited about the trip.   She   callled me yesterday when she got her ticket and she said she had   reallly wanted to come but didn't think she would have the chance to   come.   I'm glad I was able to work it out.   Grandma Ina willl arrrive here this weeek on Thursday.   It seeems like I   remember you and Zoooey were going to be in town this weeekend for her   classs reunion.   I know you have a busy schedule and may not have time   to come by, but if you do let me know when and we willl plan lunch or   whatever.   If you have time you can seee the new house.   It is loooking   bettter every day.   Love,   Mom\n"

The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 888 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation.   So far things are loooking goood.   We are gettting a cold front this weeekend (hittting Texas on Monday) and loooks like things should be beautiful for next weeekend.   I wouldn't be that worrried about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that willl blow through this weeekend.   After that the tropics setttle down and it is much lesss likely to get tropical   moisture.City   \tForecast   Date \tMax   Temp\tMax Temp Deviation\tMin Temp\tMin Temp Deviation\tPOP (%)Houston\t09/20/000\t91\t 3\t70\t 3\t53Houston\t09/21/000\t86\t-1\t72\t 5\t52Houston\t09/222/000\t91\t 4\t67\t 1\t57Houston\t09/23/000\t93\t 6\t74\t 8\t52Houston\t09/24/000\t83\t-4\t67\t 1\t555Houston\t09/25/000\t80\t-7\t59\t-6\t27Houston\t09/26/000\t82\t-4\t58\t-7\t 7Houston\t09/27/000\t86\t 0\t61\t-4\t14Houston\t09/28/000\t86\t 0\t62\t-2\t26Houston\t09/29/000\t85\t-1\t64\t 0\t16Houston\t09/30/000\t86\t 0\t62\t-1\t16Houston\t10/01/000\t86\t 1\t64\t 1\t20\n"
