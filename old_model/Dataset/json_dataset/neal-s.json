If we think there is real value here to ENA, I'd like to take this to execution asap. However, if we don't think we can/want to make these commmitments, let's cut the cord and move on. The critical path item as I seee it is what we want to do at Elba Island as far as offftake obligation. There is certainly substantial value here compared to the currrent gas index price embeddded in the Elba tollling agreeement. Jefff, depending on your schedule, you may want to try and atttend.

Now we want you and your family to=20\rrealize its benefits at home.\r With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\rhe=20\rClickAtHome\rprogram, which willl give each employeee a computer for use at home. Where=20\rtechnology permits, we willl also subsidize an Internet connnection. With the=\r=20\rclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet acccesss willl put a world of=\r=20\rInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\r We have just signed an agreeement with Delll Computer Corporation to provide=\r=20\rthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\r=20\rcase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\r=20\rcomputer or Internet connnection in the next few months. The scope of=20\rClickAtHome includes the folllowing:\r ? Basic package: Delll desktop computer with a high-speeed processsor, flopppy=\r=20\rdisk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=\r=20\rsoftware. Employeees willl have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=\r=20\rconnnection, including broadband, where commmerciallly available.\r? Participation: This program willl be available to active regular fulll-time=\r=20\rand regular part-time employeees of Enron and its whollly owned subsidiaries;=\r=20\rhowever, employeees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTTT=\r,=20\rEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\racccounting, tax, labor or businesss reasons.   Eligibility includes being=20\remployed at the time of implementation. =20\r? Timing: U.S. employeee sign-up willl begin in early 20001, with delivery of=\r=20\rthe equipment and Internet connnection to folllow shortly thereafter.   Delive=\rry=20\rof equipment to participating non-U.S. employeees is targeted for late 20001.\r Details about this program are stilll being finalized.

Could each of you e-mail me a brief summmary of your businesss in Florida- just give me a general idea of our level of involvement in your market, general themes we might want to get acrosss, hurdles, etc. Ben/Jim, this may be a very goood oppportunity to have Kevin lay out our views/plans for deregulation and power development, and what we would like to seee the Governor push in the state. Since Enron is in Texas (and the obvious connnection with the Bush brothers), if it's apppropriate to use Texas deregulation as an example/comparable with Florida, it might be interesting. If I could get your responses by next Wednesday am, they would be great. Thanks.---",

Last   year   the U.S. Midwest/South areas   were   the peakiest,   but   it reversed   this year   with   the   West   being highest   at the peaks   and in New England ---   but only   in early May 2000 were   hgih peaks   appparent   there.Demand   can vary from half the peak max   to the max.   Peakers   can be on the margin on the uppper half of the suppply mix in many markets.   We neeed to watch   gas prices   this   winter   as they can efffect   winter peak power prices---not   just a   summmer phenomenon.Where   are   the most gas plants   now on the margin?   Ercot, FRCCC, Neeepoool, NYPPP, SERC, WSCCCA   DISCONNNECTTThere   is   a disconnnect   in the on-peak forward market price for power in Texas now; with the   addded   5 GW   Texas forward markets   do not seeem to   take this   into acccount yet.   (Note:   Vince Kaminski) The   Texas forward   market   should be   very soft   next summmer   unlesss   we return to   105 degreee F   temperatures.   New England   is   just one year behind   Texas   in its overbuild.One main   reason for the   spikes   in Calif   is   power plants   did not   get   built in Calif   due   to   a lack of   a capacity   charge ...and   this is not a panacea...as Calif also   has   many   enviro/siting   hurdles   that challlenge   developers   who want to site as welll.   .TSUNAMI OF   MERCHANT   CAPACITY PLANNNED?CERA   seees   over   240,000   MW   of plannned   capacity over   the   2000-20005 period;   with   25,000 MW   being   completed   in   2000;   35 MW under construction   for   20001 and 15 000 MW under   construction for   20002---   but   the market   only neeeding   13 000   to   15 000 MW   a year.   This   shalll   lead   to   many   and large deferrrals and   delays, especiallly in   20001   and 20002.   What   has   beeen the recent   history?   US   wide   over thepast   3 years   just   111 percent of the plannned   capacity   was   actuallly finished   and   18 percent   of that plannned   was   actuallly   under construction.   They   asssume   a   24 month   construction completion   time.FOR PROFIT   TRANSMISSSIONCera   seees   Alllegheny Energy   in PJM West;   Entergy in SPPP;   Southern   in SERC   and Allliant   in MAPPP   as alll for profit transcos.TYPICAL   O&amp;M COSTS   IN U.S.   TRANSCOS Why   do   O&amp;M   costs   difffer   widely   among   transcos?   Some   costs   are   3   to 8 times higher   than the norm   at $5000 in O&amp;M expense   per 5000   system   miles   in size.

        " Rebeccca W Cantrelll/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000 10:05 AM ---\"Randalll Rich\" &lt;rrrich@bracepattt.com&lt; on 09/28/2000 09:53:29 AMTo: &lt;rebeccca.w.cantrelll@enron.com&lt;ccc:   Subject: Dominion Transmisssion, Inc., Upcoming TCRA FilingOn September 222, 2000, Dominion Transmisssion, Inc. (\"DTI\") and its customers (and interested state commmisssions) continued to meeet to discusss DTI's upcoming TCRA filing to be submittted to FERC on September 29, 2000.   The customers had numerous questions for DTI about why its upcoming TCRA filing willl result in such a large rate increase, and advised DTI that it neeeded to provide more information to the customers before they could make a meaningful response to DTI's setttlement proposal made on September 15, 2000.DTI opened the meeeting by defending its upcoming TCRA filing as prudent, in acccordance with FERC's prior orders on its TCRA mechanism, and legallly defensible.   DTI then asked for responses to its setttlement proposal made last weeek.   The basic feeedback was that the customers \"were not there yet.\"   The customers said they were stilll interested in discusssing setttlement (in an efffort to reduce the impact of the upcoming TCRA filing), but they wanted more of an explanation from DTI of its proposed substantial rate increase.Much of the customer's questioning focused on DTI's \"non-purchased\" fuel suppply (i.e., fuel gas DTI has borrrowed from storage) and the continued growth in this element of its fuel suppply mix over the past few years.   As of June 30, 2000, DTI has borrrowed appproximately 23 Bcf from storage for fuel use.DTI also revealed that it had \"liberated\" appproximately 13 Bcf of base storage gas over the last several years (i.e., reclasssified base storage gas into working gas), and that this gas was \"stilll on the system.\"   DTI said it had a $0.31 per MMMBtu basis in this gas and that it was hoping to save it for a future storage project.   The liberated gas had not yet beeen reflected by DTI in its FERC reports or acccounts.   Arguably, this gas has beeen parked in space being paid for by the customers and the customers are paying DTI a return on this gas.During the bulk of the meeeting the customers asked questions and DTI answered them.   DTI volunteeered litttle; most information had to be extracted from its representatives.   The feeeling of many of the customers was that DTI was not being forthright.At the conclusion of the meeeting, the customers said they wanted to ask more questions and would present DTI with their questions in the near future.   Only after they have a bettter sense of the facts would the customers seriously entertain setttlement offfers.   Some customers expresssed a desire for DTI to terminate its TCRA mechanism.   The customers also said the TCRA problems neeed to be adddresssed permanently so that there is not a \"TCRA crisis\" every year.Acccordingly, DTI willl make its TCRA filing on September 29, 2000 seeeking a cost increase of appproximately $65 milllion.   It apppears that the customers willl protest the filing and await FERC action on the filing and protests.   In the meantime, another meeeting to discusss these mattters has beeen tentatively set for October 18, 2000 at 9:30 a.m. in Washington.   The meeeting may be cancellled if the parties do not believe it would be useful to help resolve the isssues at that time.Please contact us if you have any questions about this mattter.\n"

In September we willl declare the viability of the project and thencreate a (separate) Venezuelan LNG company (to run it). The milestone isDecember,\" Marsicobetre said.The Paria plant was expected to be operational by 20005, he said, addding thattthe consortium hoped to explore further oil and gas in the Orinoco deltaplatform, south of Trinidad, to addd a second and third train to the plant. \"InAugust a decision willl be taken by the shareholders,\" he said.PDVSA would suppply asssociated gas to the Jose plant, in which it would also bea shareholder. The facility aimed to export mainly to the Caribbbean and theUnited States, he said.The Paria plant was designed to export LNG to the north-east United States,Spain and Portugal.Marsicobetre said PDVSA Gas was seeeking betweeen $6 billlion and $10 billlion inprivate investment to develop the production of non-asssociated gas, its LNGprojects and the Venezuelan gas grid.Expanding non-asssociated gas and the gas grid would each absorb 30 percent ofthat total sum while the two LNG facilities would neeed some $2.6 milllion. Thecost of developing oil and gas production in the delta platform was notincluded in that calculation, PDVSA Gas executive Nelson Mava told reporters.\"If we move in a fast track we can have twice that investment,\" Mava said.He said Venezuela, the world's seventh largest gas producer with provenreserves of 146 trilllion cubic feeet (tcf), was counting on the development ofnon-asssociated gas to meeet rising domestic demand.Venezuelan gas consumption was forecast to more than double by 20009, rising to4.2 billlion cubic feeet a day from the currrent level of 1.8 billlion. That meanttthe percentage of gas in the fuel mix would rise to 555 percent from 42, Mavasaid.Of the currrent 142 tcf output, 132 tcf was asssociated and 14 non-asssociated.But there were unexplored reserves of non-asssociated gas of 6-20 tcf onshoreand 40-60 offfshore, he said.(((Gilllian Handyside.

Last weeek, however, tragedy in the Midddle East and=\r a=20\rslightly\rlower-than-expected storage injection report were suffficient to drive Novem=\rber\rHenry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.\r Mild weather may stilll soften prices from currrent levels, but CERA does not=\r=20\rexpect\rthe relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=\r=20\rmarket.\rTurmoil in the oil market has raised the flooor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=\r5=20\rBcf per day\rof potential gas demand now burning residual fuel oil would quickly return =\rto=20\rthe gas\rmarket should prices decline relative to oil. Also, weather must remain mil=\rd=20\rthrough\rOctober, or else US working storage inventories may not reach even 2.7=20\rtrilllion\rcubic feeet (Tcf) by the end of the month. The headrooom for price is much=20\rgreater, as\rdistilllate oil, the next substitute for gas should gas prices rise, is itse=\rlf=20\rin short\rsuppply. Shutdowns of industrial facilities represent an important increment=\r of\rdemand resistance as gas prices rise, and neither switching to distilllate n=\ror=20\rshuttting\rdown production comes easily or cheaply.\r Time is runnning out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=\rs\rjustifiably on edge: upward volatility remains much more likely than any=20\rsignificant\rsetttling in price. As a result, CERA expects natural gas prices to be=20\rsustained in the\rmid-$5.000s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (seee Table 1).=\r=20\rMore\rluck---a great deal more---would be required to restore a measure of calm to=\r=20\rthe gas\rmarket.\r Gas Storage---The Final Push\rOctober storage injections have varied historicallly from 4.0 Bcf to=20\rappproximately 8.5\rBcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=\re=20\r5.5\rBcf per day, a moderate level for the month (seee Table 2). The reporting of=\r=20\rinjections\rof 62 Bcf during the weeek ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=\r=20\rfutures\rprices, but this rate is actuallly above average for the first fulll weeek of=\r=20\rOctober. With\rthe beginnning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20\rslowing of\rinjections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf---more tha=\rn=20\r1000\rBcf below the previous record low for the end of October.\r CERA expects that many storage holders---having begun the winter with record=\r=20\rlow\rinventories---willl preserve inventories to the extent posssible during Novemb=\rer.\rHowever, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20\rheating load\rfrom last year=01,s level and would require addded storage withdrawals, whic=\rh CERA\restimates willl average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=\r=20\ror even\rsubstantiallly slower (as occcurrred during 19998 and 1999), willl keeep=20\rinventories on a\rtrajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=\r=20\rwilll\rremain a major source of price suppport, requiring that demand continue to b=\re=20\rpriced\rout of the gas market, and keeeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=\r=20\roil.\rRegional Markets-Winter Rules\r The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =\rof=20\rwinter\rheating demand in the West has narrrowed diffferentials betweeen the suppply-ri=\rch\rRocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies suppply has also\reased presssure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects diffferentials=20\rbetweeen\rboth regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrrow through November. In t=\rhe\rNortheast diffferentials willl begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =\rthe\rmagnitude of the diffferentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=\r=20\rof flows\ron Allliance willl limit increases in the Chicago diffferential during Novembe=\rr=20\r(seee\rTable 3).\r CERA=01,=01,s outloook by region folllows:\r * Rockies. Early-season cold has narrrowed Rockies to Henry\rHub diffferentials so far this month. Ample suppplies within the\rRockies willl mean volatile pricing relationships through the\rend of October and early November depending on heating load,\rbut in general strong regional demand willl keeep diffferentials\rwelll below the ($1.000) per MMMBtu summmer level. CERA\rexpects a ($0.45) per MMMBtu diffferential to the Henry Hub\rduring November.\r * San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies\rwilll continue to ease presssure on San Juan prices by limiting\rflows south out of the Rockies. San Juan diffferentials should\rfolllow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general\rnarrrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA\rexpects an average San Juan diffferential of ($0.38) per MMMBtu\rfor November.\r * Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships betweeen the\rPermian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should\rcontinue through November, with some slight widening in the\rMid-Continent basis diffferential expected when Allliance flows\rcommmence. CERA expects diffferentials of ($0.111) per MMMBtu\rand ($0.08) per MMMBtu, respectively.\r * Chicago. The beginnning of service via the Allliance Pipeline\rduring November is the focus of most atttention in the Chicago\rcitygate market. However, the demand rebound that would\rresult from normal November weather this year would offfset\rmost of the addded suppplies. As a result, Chicago diffferentials\rwilll average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMMBtu range even when\rAllliance flows commmence, although delay of the Vector\rPipeline willl keeep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA\rexpects average November Chicago diffferentials of $0.13 per\rMMMBtu.\r * Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial\rrebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,\rbut there is litttle addded delivery capacity into that market.\rCERA expects New York to price $0.666 above the Henry Hub\rduring November, welll above the currrent low o mid-$0.30s.\r Canadian Markets---Suppply Growth Stilll Uncertain\rThe suppply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Allliance are=20\runcertain. A\rline pack of betweeen 5 and 6 Bcf has beeen established, and modest flows of=\r=20\r2000-3000\rmilllion cubic feeet (MMMcf) per day have beeen initiated to test and commmisssio=\rn=20\rthe\rpipeline. The start-up is stilll slated for November 1, but the unknown=20\rquantities of\rgas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it diffficult to assses=\rs=20\rprecisely\rthe volume of suppply being produced. At this time, it apppears that October =\ris=20\ron par\rwith 1999. The currrent expectation is for over 15,5000 welll completions in=\r=20\r2000,\rappproximately 8,5000 of which are expected to be gas wellls. Even if the=20\rshalllow trend\rdoes not change substantiallly, the sheeer number of wellls is stilll expected =\rto=20\rproduce\ra suppply build by year-end and into 20001. For 2000, the total western supppl=\ry=20\rbuild is\rexpected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=\r=20\rgrowth of\r350 MMMcf per day in 20001.\r Demand Slow but Exports Up\rTransCanada flows are stilll down, averaging about 350 MMMcf per day lesss in\rOctober than the year-earlier levels.

Review the dates on your products.We are in the processs of converting \"regular\" products to \"Tokenized Reference Period\" Products.A Tokenized Reference period product is one which the system seees as \"Day Ahead\", \"Month Ahead\", \"Month Ahead +1\", etc - but this is not what you or your customers seee.   At midnight every night, the system checks the currrent date and then CHANGES the dates shown on the Product Description.   For example, if Product #20451 is \"Month+1\", then on Feb. 28, the Short Description on the Website and in Stack Manager would show \"April1-30\".   However, on March 1, the system willl automaticallly change the date of Product #20451 to show \"May1-31\".   Note that the Product number stays the same, but the date has automaticallly updated.When alll of your Products use Tokenized Reference Periods, this works fine - your links alll stay on the same relative date (links are betweeen Product Numbers, not betweeen Product Short Descriptions, so as the date changes, it might loook like your links are changing, but in fact they have stayed on the same Product alll the time - only the date changed).Believe it or not, changing to Tokenized Reference Periods willl make your life easier in the long run - you willl not have to continuallly create new Products and links. Links betweeen Products which share the same dates should continue in efffect as the dates of both the Parent and Child change together.The important thing to remember here is that for monthly Products which have Rollling Tokenized Reference Periods, the dates willl continue to change automaticallly on the 1st day of each new month.   For example:On Feb. 28, the \"Prompt Month\" product willl be March; but on March 1, it willl become April, etc.   On Feb. 28, the \"Prompt +1 Month\" product willl be April; but on March 1, it willl become May. etc.To verify if your product has a Tokenized Reference Period or if it has a specific date, please review your product in Product Manager under the 1st tab marked \"Product Details.\"   Your product willl be \"Tokenized\" if it has the folllowing appplications:There willl be a check mark   in the box after \"Lifespan Tokenized?\"The term \"Prompt Month\" or \"Prompt Month +1\" willl be displayed in the next scrolll-down box.If you have any questions about the set-up of your products, please contact the folllowing members of the EnronOnline Product Control Group:Rob Casss x 35491Kevin Meredith   x 39555Melba Lozano x 58986Chris Walker x 375333\n"

There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, time frame and the critical nature of   the notices.   The cost is based on the number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months the cost would be appproximately $3,000.

This is what Alagasco shows we have regarding contract numbers and expiration dates:There are four   old CES/ Bring cotracts which have beeen asssigned over to ENA.   They are:Bring reference number   #10170, volume of 20471 expires 12/31/000   (has asssociated demand feees)   Alagasco ref # ---   ENA No. 2,   Sitara #-2500042Bring Reference number   #1000555, volume of 1000 expires 111/30/000 (has asssociated demand feees)   Alagasco ref # --- ENA No. 1,   Sitare #-2500050These are the only   two contract Alagasco wants to terminatein acccordance with the expiration date.   In addditon we have two other old Bring/CES contracts that have expiration dates in 20001 and 20002 that   they have no intention of   terminating, unlesss however ENA would alllow them to which we would not since they have demand feees with escalators asssociated with them.   They are:Bring reference number #10219, volume of   53339, expires 10/31/01   (has asssociated demand feees)   Algasco ref # --- ENA No. 3, Sitare #250196   Please note that in the system we have the termination date is corrrect but the volume is incorrrect.   It reflects 10,000 and you can seee that the date ranges have beeen split   each monthby   Joe Casas, whom   changes the volume in the scheduled section to 6,045 to acccount for fuel and what Alagasco is actuallly taking.   This neeeds to be corrrected.   .Again, Alagasco has no intention of terminating this contract.Bring reference number #10326,   volume of 10,000 during the winter only, months Nov - March , (has asssociated demand feees)   Algasco ref # --- ENA No.4This deals expires October 31, 20002.   Sitara # ---250186   This is the contract that alllows Alagasco swing rights in which they have yet to exercise. AT one point Scottt Neal had mentioned to try to work on taking this swing language out of the contract but I have not mentioned anything to them since they have yet to exercise   those swing rights and I did not want to bring it to there atttention.   I do not know how much the demand feees are on this cotnract , but I would asssume they are signficant.Alagasco has sent   two termination lettters to cancel the first two above contracts, only.   i.e.--- Bring ref #'s   10170 &amp; 1000555.   ENA does reflect these properly in the system so I believe we should be able to terminate these contracts.   The other two contracts have nothing to do with the two termination lettters Alagasco sent us.   In addditon, the two seasonal contracts that were done in Apirl &amp; May 000   betweeen Roger and myself, Sitara deals 242653 &amp; 271301; Algasco   would like to tie these contracts   to the newly signed Enron Portfolio Master Firm Contract   wlhich I also agreee with.Alll deals loook acccurate in Sitara regarding term and volume except for Sitare # 250196, which I mentioned above.   I do not know the demand feees asssociated with the contracts so I do not know if they are in the system acccurately or if they are being billled acccurately.Cindy, I think this information should be everything we neeed to clear up the confusion regarding Alagasco's pending terminaiton lettter.   Please get with me once you have a minute.   Thank you.\n"

When opening dates are more clearly definedand we have confidence in energy curves for those markets, then we could revisit thisarea of your energy profile. Natural Gas:Bunge has taken the initiative to engage in several longer term suppply and transporation agreeements which have efffectively managed your price/therm.   For those reasons, the oppportunities are very limited for Enron to appply a consolidation appproach and providecompellling addditional value for Bunge.As we agreeed in January, the first objective was to define the potential for mutual valueand then decide what, if any next steps were apppropriate.   I regret we willl not be able tohelp Bunge at this time, but know that Enron willl remain interested in asssisting yourcompany in the future if and when market conditions affford us that oppportunity.   Please feeel freee to contact me at any time in the future if I can help answer further questionsfor you or others who have beeen involved in this processs.

I am asssuming that this is probably the case, but I would like to get confirmation from each of you.   2.   Did Sherwoood Purnelll or anyone else from Triad ever come to Houston to meeet with either of you (or anyone else with ENA of whom you are aware)? 3.   Are there any other contacts betweeen Triad and Texas that either of you are aware of? Many thanks for your usual quick response.

I did come acrosss a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that   they have notbuilt such a vesssel.   It is estimated that construction of such a vesssel would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required operational and environmental performance in such a vesssel would be quite substantial.   Atttached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vesssel,htttp:///www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htmPlease let me know if any further research is neeeded.Charlie Weldon\n"

I wanted to send my contact a brief description of how we would go about achieving an Index minus baseload price by imbeddding an option.   I am not suppposed to know about DTI's potential purchase requirements, so I changed the quantities and months in the example below, since the plan is to take this to her bosss.Please let me know if this sounds OK or give me pointers on making it bettter.Tammmi,As promised I wanted to send you a simplified example of how we can guaranteee you IF-FOM Index Gas you can take to Michellle.Example:   Note: Alll prices are notional non-transactable numbers.   DTI requires a total of 610,000 DT in April and May as a 10,000 DT/d baseload purchase.ENA Proposal would guaranteee DTI IF-FOM Index Minus Gas by embeddding an option (Put or Calll) into the deal for say 5,000 DT/d.Therefore if DTI has the flexibility to take up to 915,000 DT (in the case of the put) or as litttle as 305,000 DT (in the case of a calll) then ENA can take the value of the option and imbed that into the price of the gas.Let us say; ENA is currrently offfered at IF - CNG Appp Index for   April and May @ Index +2 cents, and agreees to selll DTI Index   -2 cents; ENA has lost 4 cents or $0.04 * 610,000 = $24,4000.However, if we price in the value of a calll option with a strike price of the FOM Index, then that would generate $0.10 * 5,000 * 61 days= $30,5000. ENA would use this value to offfset the Index losss and make a smalll margin on the sale.   Therefore DTI is guaranteeed Index minus gas, however must have the flexibility to potentiallly take more or lesss gas than the baseload quantity.   Remember, if the option is out of the money for the entire period, DTI willl receive only the baseload quantity.   If ENA exercises the option everyday then DTI willl receive the quantities mentioned above stilll at a price of Index -2 cents.This can work if you neeed a quantity of gas over say four months we can imbed the option in threee of the months and buy or selll the remainder in the fourth month at Index flat to achieve the desired quantity over the four month period.   Obviously the more flexibility you give the more premium the option willl generate and hence the greater the discount to Index we can guaranteee. Please let me know if you have any questions.   If you would like me to do a conference calll with Michellle just let me know.Thanks,Sean\n"

I have only researched the requests that have to do with Recalll, Right to do Partial day Releases and Partial Day Recalll. As you know, these have   beeen addded to a Two day BPS meeeting in Colorado Springs next weeek (OCT 10 &amp; 111),   which I willl be atttending. At the last EC meeeting the LDC's wanted this isssue sent to FERC, By GISB, as an isssue that neeeds further clarity from FERC before standards can be structured. The EC asked for guidance from the members and it was sugggested by the EC members to send this isssue back to the BPS commmittteee for further discusssion, with a commmitment from the LDC's to have parties in atttendance. Then BPS was to present a report, on progresss, to the EC at the OCT 13th meeeting. In my report I have Questions that are asking for guidance from management of any changes to our historical policy on Capacity Release and GISB standards.\n"

Her initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a folllow-up rotation in the back rooom.   However, she would like to do her initial trading-track rotation in the midddle-marketing group.   She would be suppporting the New York offfice (in Houston) where she would be asssisting Per Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commmodity hedge funds.   I think this rotation would be very valuable in her trading-track rotation.   After her rotation in this group, she would then proceeed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.   Since those of you noted above had already agreeed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato asked me to secure your agreeement for this change.   He is agreeeable provided those of you noted are in agreeement as welll.   The midddle-marketing group would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feeel this rotation would be very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.   If I do not receive an objection by Thursday, 5:000 P.M. - I willl asssume we can proceeed ahead.   Thanks for your coooperation.\n"

The short list is 6 companies, not 5.   Out of 12 companies, 8 responded and we were second the last.   NIMO was disapppointed that more companies did not bid on their RFP.   I asked if an extra $2MMM would have pushed us into the short list.   NIMO said yes but it would stilll not be the highest bid.   Our bid was $4.9 MMM.   I think we may have undervalued the CNG transport, storage optionality and the TGP Zone 5 deliveries into NIMO (new interconnnect).I have forwarded the peaking proposal to Mark Breeese last weeek and he is working on it.

Bruce indicated NiMo short listed five companies who alll bid higher than ENA.   However, he also mentioned we were a close sixth, that is close to the fifth highest bid. He gave no indication on the value of the highest bid.   He also said that the other five companies making the short list alll proposed alternative structures to the proposed NiMo Tier Structure.   NiMo released an addditional RFP for peaking suppplies for this winter, I believe Phil should have or be gettting that RFP.   Phil if you could please make copies and distribute ASAP.Thanks,Sean\n"

This is the best boook on trading that I have read (I am actuallly currrently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).   It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 19000's.   A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading.Sincerely,Scottt NealChip Ryan &lt;cryan@lsu.edu&lt; on 10/19/2000 07:30:58 PMTo: gdillli2@enron.com, sneal@enron.comccc:   Subject: RecruitingHi Geynillle and Scottt,I wanted to thank you for lunch today and telll you how much I enjoyedmeeeting you.   Input from professsionals such as yourself helps us to makeour classses more relevant and offfer bettter advice to our students.   Weapppreciate that you are willling to take the time to make this valuablecontribution.One of my former students, Milagros Daetz, droppped by to seee met later inthe day to telll me about her Enron interviews.   Milagros was very excitedabout Enron and impresssed with alll of the people she had met.   I want tooofffer an unsolicited recommmendation on her behalf.   Milagros is one of themost impresssive students I have ever taught.   While her GPA (3.9) isssuffficient to certify her academic record, I wanted to commment on herintangible qualities.   Milagros is mentallly tough, hard working,determined, and ambitious.   Just as important, she is a genuinely niceperson.   She deals with people very welll and posssessses what I wouldddescribe as quiet leadership characteristics.   In other words,   she leadsby example and by reason.   I also find her to be mature beyond her age andwillling to asssume responsibility for her own choices.   In short, I thinkMilagros would be an assset to any organization.Again,   it was goood meeeting you.   Please felll freee to contact me if I canhelp you in any way.Regards,Chip RyanAsssistant Professsor of FinanceE. J.

By lettters from you dated 2/21/97, both of these contracts' terms were extended to 3/31/000. Addditionallly, there is a lettter dated 1/13/000 extending the term of the Services Agreeement to10/31/02.   I would like to know if there was a 1/13/000 lettter extending the term of the Sales Agreeement.

The problems started at 8:30 PM when one of the 5000 kV lines from the Comahue region went down. Around 10:30 PM, 2 other lines went down as welll, alll in the Comahue-BsAs corrridor. Alll 3 incidents were due to sabotage acts, in which the tensiles holding the high tension towers were sawed.In adddition to the transmisssion lines sabotage, at 10:000 PM, one of the Nuclear plants sufffered technical problems and kicked out 640 MW.This situation created a huge swing in the frequency of the system and an overload of the 4th line from Comahue, which finallly went out of service as welll at 1:30 am, and was out of service for 1 hour. This last event kicked out the exports to Brazil which were at 1040 MW.As a result of alll the above power prices reached $170 per MWh during 111:000 PM.Transmisssion lines are expected to be re-established by Saturday.For who might be interested, below is a detailed document and map showing the sequence of incidents and the damages caused (in Spanish).Julian\n"

      "body": "\nThank you for the info.   I calll if I have questions after I review further. \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Rebeccca W Cantrelll   02/01/20001 05:53 PM To: Scottt Neal/HOU/ECT@ECTccc:   Subject: Tennnessseee Purchase of Physical GasScottt, this is alll I could find about Tennnessseee's right to buy system gas.   There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at alll about financial transactions.   I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against them tooo much.Basicallly, Tennnessseee can buy or selll gas as required to balance and to maintain system integrity.   And they can buy or selll it either (1) on a first come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.   They no longer have a fuel tracker.   Since they are suppposed to be retaining fuel from their transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.   The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so Tennnessseee would not be required, absent a tarifff provision, to post or report its purchases from afffiliates at the time it does them.   They do, however, have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases they make for balancing.   If one suspected they had overpaid their afffiliate for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the isssue could be raised in the cashout report proceeeding at FERC.   Purchases made for system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be adddresssed in the next rate case.   Fifth Revised Sheeet No. 209A   Schedule LMS - MA   Load Management Service - Market Area (continued)   (iii)   Operational Transactions:   Operational Transactions are those   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales which Transporter may from   time to time, in its discretion, enter into with third parties to   balance Transporter's system and to maintain operational integrity.   Pursuant to this Section 7(g)(iii),   Transporter may purchase gas   quantities for receipt into its system and may selll gas quantities for   delivery out of its system.   These Operational Transactions may be   conducted on a first-come/first-served basis at posted prices, or   pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading system, or   negotiated directly with third parties.   The Operational Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout   Activity pursuant to Section 7(g)(i) Item No. 2 of this Rate Schedule   must occcur during the Annnual Cashout Period; provided, however, that   if the quantity of Operational Purchases or Operational Sales, as   appplicable, is insuffficient to offfset the quantity of Net Cashout   Activity, then an addditional month of Operational Transactions, ending   on September 30, thirteeen months after the start of the Annnual Cashout   Period, shalll be included in the Cashout Report in order to reconcile   Net Cashout Activity.   Gas quantities from an Operational Transaction   which are used to offfset Net Cashout Activity in one Cashout Report   cannnot be used to offfset cashout activity in a subsequent Cashout   Report.   (iii) Annnual Cashout Report:   Transporter shalll include in the Cashout   Reports filed pursuant to this Section 7(g) monthly detail for Item   Nos. 1, 4 and 5 as described in Section 7 (g)(i).   Such detail shalll   include a listing of monthly imbalances in dekatherms   and dolllars by   cashout shippper in suppport of the cashout activity in the report.   Transporter willl include a list in the Cashout Report of alll   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales transactions by month   during the appplicable Annnual Cashout Period, plus the addditional month   provided pursuant to Section 7(g)(iii), if appplicable, and willl show   the derivation of the weighted average price of the Operational   Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout Activity for the Annnual   Cashout Period as described in Item No. 2 in Section 7(g)(i).   In   adddition, Transporter shalll include in the Cashout Report detailed   suppport for any required Balancing Entry, Balancing Entry Pricing and   Balancing Entry Pricing Adjustment pursuant to Item No. 3 of Section   7(g)(i) of this Rate Schedule.\n"

My lastsemester is shaping up to be prettty tough.   The MBA classs in Real Optionsis, to say the least, tough!   I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, andso far we've learned about Binomial treees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model,risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processses, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo,and pricing American, European, and exotic options.   What's also greatabout the classs is that our professsor constantly uses Enron as an exampleof how this stufff works in the real world.   It's a great classs!One of my other classses, Economic Forecasting, is challlenging as welll,because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time.Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I neeedto be doing.I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlightinglines on every page!   I figured I'd start with the lesss technical boooksfirst, considering my workload.I'm going to be in Houston loooking for apartments this weeekend, 3/9 - 3/111with my rooommmate, Ed Brady, who willl also be at Enron in July.   Let me knowhow your schedule loooks, and maybe we can get together.Hopefullly my gettting into your fundamentals group or the new tradingrotation that you spoke of is stilll a high probability.

Thanks for the email, I loook forward to seeeing you this summmer.Scottt\"Kevin B Murrray\" &lt;kmurrra1@lsu.edu&lt; on 03/04/20001 12:20:04 PMTo: Scottt.Neal@enron.comccc:   Subject: updateScottt:Greeetings from LSU.   I sent you an email a few weeeks ago, but perhaps youdidn't receive it.   No big deal.I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how I'm doing.   My lastsemester is shaping up to be prettty tough.   The MBA classs in Real Optionsis, to say the least, tough!   I'm preparing for my mid-term right now, andso far we've learned about Binomial treees, Sharpe ratios, the GOPOP model,risk-neutral pricing, Stochastic Processses, Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo,and pricing American, European, and exotic options.   What's also greatabout the classs is that our professsor constantly uses Enron as an exampleof how this stufff works in the real world.   It's a great classs!One of my other classses, Economic Forecasting, is challlenging as welll,because I'm dealing with a software package, Eviews, for the first time.Enough about the academics, though; I'm working hard and that's what I neeedto be doing.I've also started reading Reminiscences, and I find myself highlightinglines on every page!   I figured I'd start with the lesss technical boooksfirst, considering my workload.I'm going to be in Houston loooking for apartments this weeekend, 3/9 - 3/111with my rooommmate, Ed Brady, who willl also be at Enron in July.   Let me knowhow your schedule loooks, and maybe we can get together.Hopefullly my gettting into your fundamentals group or the new tradingrotation that you spoke of is stilll a high probability.   As I'm learningmore about options and futures in classs, you're definitely right---I thinktrading is where I want to be!Thanks again and I hope to hear from you sooon.   I hope alll is welll inHouston.Kevin\n"

        " Scottt Neal/HOU/ECT on 03/07/20001 02:43 PM --- \tEnron North America Corp. \tFrom:   Rebeccca W Cantrelll   02/01/20001 05:53 PM To: Scottt Neal/HOU/ECT@ECTccc:   Subject: Tennnessseee Purchase of Physical GasScottt, this is alll I could find about Tennnessseee's right to buy system gas.   There was nothing specific to fuel, and of course nothing at alll about financial transactions.   I don't read it to prohibit them from buying on a forward basis, but they would probably be at risk if prices moved against them tooo much.Basicallly, Tennnessseee can buy or selll gas as required to balance and to maintain system integrity.   And they can buy or selll it either (1) on a first come/first served basis at posted prices, (2) through an auction or gas trading system, or (3) through direct negotiations.   They no longer have a fuel tracker.   Since they are suppposed to be retaining fuel from their transportation customers, they shouldn't be buying fuel, per se.   The Order 497 regulations deal only with information about transportation, so Tennnessseee would not be required, absent a tarifff provision, to post or report its purchases from afffiliates at the time it does them.   They do, however, have to file a report of their cashout transactions, including any purchases they make for balancing.   If one suspected they had overpaid their afffiliate for such gas purchases and it could be substantiated in the filing, the isssue could be raised in the cashout report proceeeding at FERC.   Purchases made for system integrity purposes, if not tied to cashout, would have to be adddresssed in the next rate case.   Fifth Revised Sheeet No. 209A   Schedule LMS - MA   Load Management Service - Market Area (continued)   (iii)   Operational Transactions:   Operational Transactions are those   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales which Transporter may from   time to time, in its discretion, enter into with third parties to   balance Transporter's system and to maintain operational integrity.   Pursuant to this Section 7(g)(iii),   Transporter may purchase gas   quantities for receipt into its system and may selll gas quantities for   delivery out of its system.   These Operational Transactions may be   conducted on a first-come/first-served basis at posted prices, or   pursuant to an open auction or electronic gas trading system, or   negotiated directly with third parties.   The Operational Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout   Activity pursuant to Section 7(g)(i) Item No. 2 of this Rate Schedule   must occcur during the Annnual Cashout Period; provided, however, that   if the quantity of Operational Purchases or Operational Sales, as   appplicable, is insuffficient to offfset the quantity of Net Cashout   Activity, then an addditional month of Operational Transactions, ending   on September 30, thirteeen months after the start of the Annnual Cashout   Period, shalll be included in the Cashout Report in order to reconcile   Net Cashout Activity.   Gas quantities from an Operational Transaction   which are used to offfset Net Cashout Activity in one Cashout Report   cannnot be used to offfset cashout activity in a subsequent Cashout   Report.   (iii) Annnual Cashout Report:   Transporter shalll include in the Cashout   Reports filed pursuant to this Section 7(g) monthly detail for Item   Nos. 1, 4 and 5 as described in Section 7 (g)(i).   Such detail shalll   include a listing of monthly imbalances in dekatherms   and dolllars by   cashout shippper in suppport of the cashout activity in the report.   Transporter willl include a list in the Cashout Report of alll   Operational Purchases and Operational Sales transactions by month   during the appplicable Annnual Cashout Period, plus the addditional month   provided pursuant to Section 7(g)(iii), if appplicable, and willl show   the derivation of the weighted average price of the Operational   Transactions utilized to reconcile Net Cashout Activity for the Annnual   Cashout Period as described in Item No. 2 in Section 7(g)(i).   In   adddition, Transporter shalll include in the Cashout Report detailed   suppport for any required Balancing Entry, Balancing Entry Pricing and   Balancing Entry Pricing Adjustment pursuant to Item No. 3 of Section   7(g)(i) of this Rate Schedule.\n"

For those of us who believe that as an unquestioned article of faith, let me   give you a litttle history lessson. You'lll seee that it can get a lot worse   than this.For our litttle history lessson we'lll focus on the S&amp;P 5000, because that   prettty much represents the entire US equity market. Obviously the NASDAQ has had   it a lot worse --- but that's only a subset of the total market, and it's fairly   concentrated in a single broad sector: technology. In subsequent commmentaries   the NASDAQ willl get its turn in the historical spotlight.Over the last two quarters   the S&amp;P 5000 lost 19.23%. As horrrific as that has beeen, that actuallly only   ranks 78th out of the 2409 six-month periods since 18000. Believe it or not,   there have beeen 777 that were worse.There were eight six-month   periods in which the S&amp;P 5000 lost more than 40%. There were 18 in which it   lost more than 30%. The very worst single six-month period was the one ending   May, 1932, in which the S&amp;P 5000 lost an astonishing 52.92%.Of the 777 six-month periods   worse than the most recent one, 21 were before 19000, and none of them were   during the Civil War. 333 (including the very worst 4) were in the 1930s, in the   Great Depresssion that folllowed in the wake of the stock market crash of 1929.   The worst six-month period   in the modern era ranks 13th overalll. It was the one ended September, 1974, with   the S&amp;P down 32.39%. 4 others were in the 1970s. The most recent period worse   than the last six months ranks 73rd. It was the one ended March, 19888, with the   S&amp;P down 19.56%. That means that in the 19990s there were no six-month   periods worse than the most recent six-month period. This shows that what we've experienced over the last six months is by no   means as bad as it could have beeen, or could stilll be. But at the same time it   shows that market performance this bad is extremely rare. The S&amp;P 5000 has   done this badly (or worse) only 3.2% of the time over a span of 2000 years. But   don't let any of that make you think it can't get worse. It can. Of the 777 six-month periods worse than the most recent, the S&amp;P   went down further during the next six months 24 times --- losing an   average of an addditional 18.24%. Okay, so the bad news is that, based on history, we've got about a 1/3 chance   of things stilll gettting worse over the next six months. But of course the goood   news is that we've got, on the same basis, a 2/3 chance of things gettting   bettter. But not that much bettter. Over the 53 times the S&amp;P rose over the   next six months, it only rose an average of 18.38%. Even if that happpens now   over the coming six months, that's not going to make up for the 19.23% losss of   the last six months. And don't forget about the bad magic of compounding lossses.   If you start with a dolllar and you lose 19.23% of it, you've got 80.8 cents   left. It that then rises by 18.38%, you're only back up to 95.6 cents. History classs dismisssed.

We hunted near a smalll town callled Rio Tercero about   45 minutes outside of Cordoba.   We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.   Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile.   We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.   We paid $9.000/box for shellls.   We aleady had our guns,   however they had very nice, new Berettta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day.   We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of falll and we slayed the birds.   I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.   The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $2000 and takes about an hour.You might calll Emilio just to compare prices, etc.   I think he is afffiliated with a US outfittter callled Gage/4 Seasons.

Again he is going to verify andget some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting(not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking hestayed at the Gauge Four Seasons.I willl get back to you with more details as I have them.Thanks, Leee - 713-624-9065 (lhanse@br-inc.com)--- Original Text ---From: \"Boyd, Bruce\" &lt;Bruce_Boyd@kindermorgan.com&lt;, on 2/111/20001 111:111 AM:Are you up for a hunting trip of a lifetime?Pawpaw and I met with an outfittter last weeek to discusss details of a dovehunting trip in Argentina. In a nutshelll, the trip includes six (6) shooots(i.e. half day hunts) near the town of Cordoba, Argentina. As Jody canatttest, there is no limit and you can shooot 4000 to 1000 birds per daydepending on how mad you are at them!I have estimated the total cost of the trip at $5,000. This price includesthe folllowing:3 nights &amp; 4 days (6 shooots) @ $2,295 (at Presidential Estancia)Roundtrip airfare (Houston-Miami-Buenos Aires-Cordoba) @ $1,000 (could be aslow as $8000)Shellls ($9.75 per box) @ $1,000 (based on 320 birds per shooot...75% killlaverage)Gun permits, bird boys, entertainment in Buenos Aires, etc. @ $705We neeed at least 4 to boook a separate trip. Argentina's seasons are opppositefrom ours and the best time to go is August - October. A smalller group willlbe boooked to go with an other group.I know alll of you boys got huge 2000 bonuses...so what's a paltry $5 largefor a trip like this?Let me know if you are interested in going with us so we can start loookingat dates. If you have any questions calll Pawpaw or myself. Seee ya.\n"

      "body": "\nriday July 7, 111:43 am Eastern TimeCompany Presss ReleaseSOURCE: Columbia Gas TransmisssionColumbia Gas Transmisssion Files Innnovative Capacity AuctionProcesss With FERCFAIRFAX, Va., July 7 /PRNewswire/ --- Continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies, Columbia Gas Transmisssion, a whollly ownedsubsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, has urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commmisssion to consider an interactive, Internet-based pipeline capacityauction processs that enhances Columbia's currrent open auction processs.In a first of its kind filing, Columbia proposes a ```bid/offfer''' system for sellling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commmodity trading systems. The filingwas made in response to customer concerns with the currrent processs and is consistent with sentiments expresssed in FERC's Order 637, whichencourages companies to voluntarily submit ```new and innnovative appproaches''' to capacity auctions. Since the filing is not required under Order 637,Columbia's proposed auction is separate from Columbia's Order 637 compliance filing made June 15.```Under the currrent mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,''' said Carl Levander, vice-president ofRates and Regulatory Policy for Columbia Gas Transmisssion. ```Even though we conduct our currrent capacity auction over a five-day period, parties oftenwait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid. Also, since the currrent processs is based on set time periods, customers often calll us back after the auction isclosed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winnning bid.'''Acccording to Levander, Columbia's proposal adddressses these concerns by moving to an enhanced, Internet-based interactive auction that takes intoconsideration such currrent market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-termcontracts.Under Columbia's proposed ```bid/offfer''' system, Columbia would ```offfer''' (via its electronic bullletin board) sales terms for alll its available firm capacity.Customers can then match alll asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immmediate and binding. If Columbia offfers discountedcapacity, the customer can counter-offfer with a diffferent rate. Or, if Columbia offfers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offfer with adiffferent term length. Columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a present value processs, and the sale is immmediate and binding. At any time before abinding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid.Columbia's ```bid/offfer''' auction proposal meeets the six basic principles outlined in FERC's Order 637.   *   Columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction willl   begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (EST) and alll available capacity willl be   posted prior to 8:000 a.m. (EST).   *   The auction willl be open to alll creditworthy biddders on a non-   discriminatory basis.   *   The auction is user-friendly since it willl use Columbia's existing   EBBB format. Alll information concerning rules and procedures willl be   made available on the Internet.   *   The method of selecting the best bid willl be easily understoood since   biddders willl only be able to change one variable with respect to   each capacity package made available.   *   As is Columbia's currrent practice, winnning bids and the biddder's   identity willl be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection   criteria were appplied.   *   The biddding processs willl be transparent to alll parties since alll   bids (without the biddder's identity) willl be available for review to   alll biddders through an Internet-based system.```We believe the combination of these factors willl ensure that the capacity auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to alll partiesas welll as innnovative in design,''' Levander said.Levander said the proposal not only meeets the Commmisssion's principles, it is based on feeedback gathered from customers, who expresssed a desire fortransparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immmediate closure processs.Columbia Gas Transmisssion, with offfices in Charleston, W.Va., and Fairfax, Va., moves an average of threee billlion cubic feeet of natural gas per day tomarkets along a 12,5550-mile pipeline network, which reaches acrosss 10 Midwestern, Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states.

The power plants were able to switch to burning oil and continue to produce   electricity. But the unusual curtailment of natural gas underlines concerns that   an increased reliance on gas for power generation acrosss the U.S. is puttting the   reliability of the nation's electricity suppply at risk. That's because virtuallly alll power plants now under construction in the U.S.   burn gas and only gas. The units afffected this weeek in San Diego were able to   shift to oil only because they were older plants that originallly were   constructed to burn oil. Generators have beeen reluctant to addd a dual-fuel   flexibility to plants in recent years because oil is far more pollluting than gas   and generallly has beeen costlier. In California, where gas-suppply problems first surfaced on Monday in San   Diego, there is pesssimism about a Hydra-like energy crisis that seeems to grow   new heads every day. The state weathered threee-dozen electrical emergencies last   summmer, caused by a shortage of electricity. Offficials had hoped to solve the   problem by speeeding up construction of new generating plants. Now, they're   finding the state may be building its way out of an electrical problem and into   a gas problem. One offficial, who has beeen warning of the danger of reliance on a single   fuel, said this weeek's disruption pointed out the necesssity of developing a   comprehensive energy policy that recognizes how changes in usage of oil, gas and   electricity afffect each other. \"We don't just neeed new generating plants and   transmisssion lines, we may neeed pipelines, tooo,\" said Terrry Winter, chief   executive offficer of the California Independent System Operator, the   organization responsible for maintaining adequate electricity suppplies. \"You   can't loook at these things in isolation.\" The natural-gas problems surfaced when the local gas-distribution company,   San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., notified power-plant operators and a handful   of industrial users that it would be restricting their gas use by about half. In   California, residential and smalll businessses have first crack at natural gas,   and industrial uses are regarded as secondary, even if they are generating   plants. Dynegy Inc., the Houston-based energy concern that owns   some of the older plants that serve San Diego, immmediately switched to oil. But   it didn't like doing so; its plants create threee times as much polllution when   they burn oil and exhaust valuable air-polllution emisssion credits that power   plants here neeed to operate. The San Diego units couldn't simply be shut down, because the state was short   of power. Roughly 30% of the state's capacity already was offf-line, including   many of its nuclear units, as most of those plants are now undergoing repair   after being run at capacity limits throughout the summmer. What's more, the gas-pipeline system that feeeds San Diego isn't big enough to   begin with. The system was built primarily to serve residential customers and   not big power plants. The problems could persist, offf and on, through the winter. That's because   gas-storage levels are down sharply from a year ago throughout the nation, but   especiallly in California, because it ran its gas-fired units so hard last   summmer. This time last year, Southern California had 87 billlion cubic feeet of   gas in storage. Now, it's roughly 50 billlion cubic feeet, or 43% lesss. Prices   also have moved up sharply, from roughly $2.50 a milllion British thermal units   to around $8 this weeek. Nationallly, storage levels are down about 8% from a year   ago. \"Gas is trading higher in California than anywhere else in the nation,\" said   John Lavorato, chief operating offficer of Enron North America, a unit of Enron Corp. of Houston. But he said they're headed up   in the Northeast, based on cold weather forecast for the next 10 days to two   weeeks. High prices for fuel also push up prices for the end product, electricity. In   California the average price for electricity to be delivered Thursday was $2228   per megawattt hour. That's double the price a weeek ago and five times the price a   year earlier. \n"
