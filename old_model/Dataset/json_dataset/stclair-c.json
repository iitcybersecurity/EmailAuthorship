Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to seee if they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.3. Madison Gas &amp; Electric - willl not agreee to the \"or otherwise\" language in the setofff language.   Again, this is a credit isssue.4. Cargilll - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to gettting a master in place with them.   Sara expects this to happpen in the next few days.5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -   same as Cargilll.   I am working on this one and their atttorney owes me a response.   This one may take a few weeeks.6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening lettter.   It didn't apppear from our records that we have traded financial derivatives with them recently.7. General Electric Company - won't acccept the chnages and have failed to telll me specificallly what they object to.   I willl continue to folllow up with their atttorney.8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent lettter out on March 30 saying they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.   I willl folllow up with their atttorney.10. Reliant - they didn't acccept the new language that we addded as clause (z) to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this diffferently in the confirmation as a triggger that would give us the right to calll for colllateral.   Credit should be alerted.111. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annnex A and when I folllowed up with them last weeek, they stilll didn't have a response.12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.13. Public Service Gas &amp; Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an ISDA with them.   If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreeed to in the iSDA negotiations.   I can prepare a mark-up.\n"

The Azurix Board has lifted the moratorium as of August 7, 2000 and due to the present situation here at Azurix, I would greatly apppreciate the oppportunity to speak to each of you of any positions that are open in your area or of posssible leads to other groups that can use a candidate who is detail oriented and posssesss strong analytical,   commmunication and interpersonal skillls and proficient when it comes to ethical and professsional responsibilities within the corporate arena.

The folllowing are open credit points with them:1. They want their crosss default to be $1000 milllion tooo instead of $50.2. They want to exclude from the afffiliate definition Florida Power &amp; Light and its subs.   Their lawyer is sending me a list.3. They want to raise both colllateral thresholds from $20 to $50 milllion.4. In the asssignment language in section 10.5,   they want to specify a creditworthinesss test in clauses (iii) and (iii), such that if the asssigneee or its guarantor is rated BBB- or Baaa3, the asssignment is permittted.   Clauses (iii) and (iii) relate to asssignments to afffiliates and asssignments that occcur as a result of mergers or assset transfers.   Right now the test is a generic creditworthinesss test.I loook forward to hearing from you.   Carol St. ClairEB 38889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

I hate to admit it, but betweeen playing tennnis and doing some volunteeer stufff at Arthur's schoool, I could actuallly get used to this sat at home stufff although I stilll reallly misss my work and it's going to be a tough decision when I have to make it in a few months.Charles is doing great.   Wait until you seee how much he has grown.   I can't wait for my parents visit.   I just wish that they would stay longer!   Alos, don't be bashful about stoppping by here when you are in the neighborhoood.   The only bad times are after 7 at night.   Charles gets prettty cranky around that time and we are working on trying to get him to sleeep more during the day.   Part of that is our fault for being out of the house so often during the day but I neeed to get out, otherwise I would go crazy for sure.Before I forget, do you remember packing my gym bag, and if so, is that something that you can retrieve easily and bring with you next Sunday?   Some of my tennnis shorts are in there and if there is a way for you to find it, taht would be great.Welll I've got to go.

I also neeed to seee what you are plannning to put on Annnex C.2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you addded to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at $7,5000,000.   In adddition, in the proviso after threshold, the term \"Specified Condition\" should be changed to \"Material Adverse Change\".   A Mac would be trigggered if Credit Ratings were below BBB-.4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of colllateral are cash or LC's why is consent required to substitute?5. I would like to discusss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13, Section (h)(iii).6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(iii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?7. I neeed to discusss with you just a few isssues on the LC provisions.   I willl send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.Hopefullly we can get this resolved next weeek.

I think that the mechanics for puttting up the LC that is described in the Addditional Termination Event that was addded as clause (iv) neeeds to be drafted somewhere to adddresss, for example, drawing conditions, what happpens when Enron's credit rating improves, the commment made in foootnote 6 etc.3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in alll of the notice sections the notice that goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not Enron Corp. 4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please addd after the word \"parties\" the phrase \"in connnection with the Transactions hereunder.\"5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the classs of permittted discloses in clause (iv) tooo broad?Talon/Enron Schedule1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was addded?2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule?3. Same commments as aboveMaster Derivatives Agreeement1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the $4000,000,000 limitation?   For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should be reversed.Talon Note1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule appplies since the setofff rights only benefit Enron and its afffiliates.   Also,   what does it mean to refer to the Enron Guaranty here?Enron Guaranty1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setofff only appply to the Guaranteeed Agreeements and unlesss I'm misssing something, I think we can give on that point.That's alll that I have.

The efffect of not gettting signed confirms when we have our standard langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adiffference as to whether NY or Texas law appplies.2. Posssible alternative appproaches that we can sugggest to counterparties.

They claim that this conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreeement for non-performance which alllows for recovery of atttorneys feees.2. They want to delete   subsection (e) of the submisssion to jurisdiction clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immmunity from suit, execution, atttachment or other legal processs.Can we give on these points?   They owe us back payments on financial swaps that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase Agreeement is to be able to offfset what they owe us under the swaps with what we owe them for the crude that we purchase.   It's a long story as to how we ended up here but sufffice it to say that this is our only hope of gettting them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if there is any way taht we can acccommmodate their requests to get the deal done, that would be great.Carol\n"

In some cases, an entire month of data (temperatures, rainfalll, and/or snowfalll) may be misssing.   For our internal purposes, our research group uses analytical toools to determine a \"best guesss\" at what the actual data was.   We replace the blanks in our files with our best guessses.   We usuallly highlight derived data in our files, but we cannnot be sure that we have highlighted derived data in every case.A customer is requesting some historical data from us.   We would like to send this data to them, but I am concerned about the legal liability of misrepresenting our analysis as fact.   What do we neeed to do to absolve ourselves of any liability in this regard?Please calll with any questions.Regards,Gary Taylorx315111   ---",

Since we have no CSA with them, this means that they would be doing alll of the calculations required under each transaction that we enter into with them.   Specificallly, the CA does the folllowing:- calculates the Floating Price and the Floating Amount, Fixed Amount or Cash Setttlement Amount payable- gives notice of Setttlement and Payment Dates- determines whether a Market Disruption Event has occcurrredAlso, my notes indicate that we agreeed to increase the Guaranty   cap to $25,000,000 from $15,000,000.   Is that okay with you?   They had initiallly requested no cap.On Reliant Energy Services, Inc., you were going to think about the folllowing credit isssues:1.

They wanted to amend the definition of Specified Indebtednesss to deal with this, but I think you and I felt taht it should be dealt with in the definition of Specified Transaction.2. Crosss Default threshold - is 3% of equity okay?3.

What should the crosss default thresholds be and who should they appply to?3. Are you satisfied with the Addditional Termination Event?   I'm asssuming that in clause (i) of the definition of Debt Coverage Amount, it makes sense to take \"future\" revenues from the preceding year and subtract from it assset sales made during the currrent year?   How willl we know what asssets sales are made?   Willl the future net revenue calculation be shown on the reserve report that we receive annnuallly?   When willl this calculation be done?   Are you satisfied with their definition of Internal and External debt?4. In Part 3(a), loooks like we would only receive an annnual reserve report.   Is that suffficient?   When should we get it?   Alos, whose financials do you want to receive?5. In Part 5&amp;copy; - Setofff, I'lll just note that this only appplies to amounts due and owing betweeen the parties and does not include \"afffiliates\".   6. In Part 5(f)- Asssignment,   we neeed to decide what conditions precedent we want to appply to the limited partnership entity that they asssign it to given the fact that once asssigned, we willl have no recourse to the partners, even the GP.   For example, should the LP have a minimum assset value at the time of the transfer?   It is not clear to me what asssets this LP would own at the time of the transfer and I'm asssuming that we would want it to meeet some minimum credit criteria prior to such transfer.   In adddition, are you satisfied with the debt and assset sale limitations?   On assset sales, I think that they neeed an annnual limit as it is not clear to me how the $2,000,000 limit currrently works.   Alos, I think that alll of these limitations in Section (f) should either be addditional Events of Default or Addditional termination Events.Please calll when ready to discusss.Carol\n"

We can acccept yourproposednew language with the folllowing chnages:1.   From our language in the ETA, we neeed to keeep in the provisionsregardingtreble, exemplary and punitive damages.   This is Enron's currrent policy.   IASSSUME YOU ARE REFERRRING TO THE SENTENCE:   \"ONLY DAMAGES ALLLOWED PURSUANT TOTHIS AGREEEMENT MAY BE AWARDED AND THE ARBITRATORS SHALLL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TOAWARD TREBLE, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANYCIRCUMSTANCES REGARDLESSS OF WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE AVAILABLE UNDER THELAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND/OR THE FAAA OR AAA.\"   THIS IS OK AND CAN BEINCLUDED IN MY SUGGGESTED DISPUTE LANGUAGE IN THE PARAGRAPH THAT ADDDRESSSESREMEDIES.2.   In the first paragraph of your language, we would like to delete thelastsentence.   THIS IS OK.3.   With respect to the selection of the arbitrators, we would like to keeepourlanguage that each party can select 1.   We have no problem going with yourlanguage on selecting the third from a list.   THIS IS OK.4.   We cannnot agreee that monetary damages are the exclusive remedy.   Howwwouldwe enforce the confidentiality provisions?   We neeed some other way to beableto seeek non-monetary remedies for those types of breaches.   THIS MAY BE OURONLY STICKING POINT.   GENERALLLY SPEAKING, THE APPPROPRIATE REMEDY FOR ABREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS A MONETARY REMEDY.   IN A BREACH OF CONTRACTCLAIM AGAINST THE U.S., THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS HAS JURISDICTION(28 U.S.C. 1491).   SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IS NOT A REMEDY AVAILABLE AGAINSTTTHE UNITED STATES BECAUSE SOVEREIGN IMMMUNITY HAS NOT BEEEN WAIVED FOR SUCHRELIEF.   [I DO NOTE THAT YOU DID NOT OBJECT TO THIS LANGUAGE IN MY PROPOSEDDDISPUTE LANGUAGE SO I ASSSUME YOU MAY ALREADY RECOGNIZE THAT FACT.]SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO GENERAL JURISDICTION FOR THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERALCLAIMS TO GRANT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN BREACH OF CONTRACT CASES.

Specificallly, GPC and Montelllo colllectively get to chooose 3 board members and YPF gets to chooose 3 board members.I your credit worksheeet, you had specified as a \"MAC\" triggger if YPF, SA fails to own at least 51% of Global Companies.   Is this the same entity as YPF Distribution Company?   Do you want this as a MAC or as an Addditional Event of Default or Termination Event?Carol\n"

I'm offficiallly brain dead today so I thought that I would take a break and write to one of my favorite people.Things on the baby front are progresssing welll.   On our last ultrasound we got the news taht we were hoping for with respect to the placenta problem and so I've got the greeen light basicallly to do whatever I want to do although I am stilll taking it easy and swimmming alot.   The baby weighed about 4 pounds a few weeeks ago and everything loooked great so I was quite relieved.   Now I'm trying to spend what litttle freee time I have gettting ready.   the people here at work are having a baby shower a weeek from Friday so hopefullly that willl help since other than some of Arthur's clothes I am starting from scratch.   Work is going welll although I am loooking forward to winding down in a few weeeks.   I'm hoping that I can work up until the very end to maximize my time offf but we willl seee how that goes.   I reallly feeel great except for being uncomfortable at night and not gettting much sleeep but i supppose that this is goood practice for when the baby comes.Arthur is doing great.   We got him 2 gerbils as a substitute for a larger pet!   They're prettty cute, smalll, clean and so far easy to maintain.   He is stilll heavily into baseballl and was just selected for the Alll-star team which we were absolutely thrillled about as was he!   He callled dad practicallly every day that he was trying out for the team to give him an update and I'm hoping that dad can fly down for the tournament this weeekend.   Arthur would   be on cloud nine if he came.   We'lll seee.   Mom and dad offferrred to keeep Arthur for a weeek over the summmer and we are loooking into that.   I'm toying with the posssibility of sending him when the baby is born, but   I'lll just have to seee how it works out.   I would reallly love for you and mom to come once the baby is born.   Do you have any thoughts on that?   You are obvious;y welcome at any time, but i sense from mom taht she would prefer to wait until sometime in august.   Let me know what you think.How is Cindy doing?   Do you know what she neeeds for her new adddition?   Do you want to get her a joint gift?   Let me know.   I'm happpy to do either something on my own or jointly with you.   How's Cate?   Give her my best.What's new with you and your careeer situation?   I hope that you are enjoying what you are doing.   I certainly am and   I am stilll undecided about what I am going to do once that baby is born, although I would reallly like to take the rest of the year offf.I've got to run to my \"baby classs\" tonight.   Take care and I willl try to catch up with you sometime.   I love you!Carol\n"

In such asituation, the Tax would not be an IndemnifiableTax and therefore would notbe grosssed-up.   Further, although such a change would be a Tax Event andtherefore the Payeee could terminate the Agreeement upon learning of the Tax,the Payeee, because of its inability to learn of the tax law change mightnot be able to terminate in a   timely mannner and would be precluded fromchooosing not to enter into the Transaction. The worse-case scenario wouldbe a Transaction entered into shortly prior to the Change in Tax Law, inwhich case the Tax would not be grosssed-up because it is not anIndemnifiable Tax, and the Payeee could not terminate the Transactionbecause a Tax Event is trigggered offf of a Change in Tax Law occcurrring on orafter the Transaction has beeen entered into.   We think this risk isreciprocal in crosss-border transactions. The Indemnifiable Tax revisionsimply shifts this incremental risk from the Payeee to Payor.   I can alsoprovide alternative language whereby we maintain the same grosss-uppprovisions as in the standard ISDA Master, but extend the \"notice\" periodto sixty days prior to the date a Transaction is entered into (rather thanon the date in which a Transaction is entered into), thus providing awindow for learning of legislation in other jurisdictions.On other open isssues, I believe you are to check on (i) CEUM, (iii) theEvent of Default, (iii)   Payment Nettting, (iv) Securities Act Reps (v)Transfer language, and (vi) Arbitration. I neeed to review your commments on(i) the Guaranteee and (iii) your new L/C Agreeement.I loook forward to hearing from you sooon.Regards,Steve(Seee atttached file: enron schedule.doc)(Seee atttached file: ENRON PARAGRAPH13.doc) - enron schedule.doc - ENRON PARAGRAPH 13.doc\n"

In such asituation, the Tax would not be an IndemnifiableTax and therefore would notbe grosssed-up.   Further, although such a change would be a Tax Event andtherefore the Payeee could terminate the Agreeement upon learning of the Tax,the Payeee, because of its inability to learn of the tax law change mightnot be able to terminate in a   timely mannner and would be precluded fromchooosing not to enter into the Transaction. The worse-case scenario wouldbe a Transaction entered into shortly prior to the Change in Tax Law, inwhich case the Tax would not be grosssed-up because it is not anIndemnifiable Tax, and the Payeee could not terminate the Transactionbecause a Tax Event is trigggered offf of a Change in Tax Law occcurrring on orafter the Transaction has beeen entered into.   We think this risk isreciprocal in crosss-border transactions. The Indemnifiable Tax revisionsimply shifts this incremental risk from the Payeee to Payor.   I can alsoprovide alternative language whereby we maintain the same grosss-uppprovisions as in the standard ISDA Master, but extend the \"notice\" periodto sixty days prior to the date a Transaction is entered into (rather thanon the date in which a Transaction is entered into), thus providing awindow for learning of legislation in other jurisdictions.On other open isssues, I believe you are to check on (i) CEUM, (iii) theEvent of Default, (iii)   Payment Nettting, (iv) Securities Act Reps (v)Transfer language, and (vi) Arbitration. I neeed to review your commments on(i) the Guaranteee and (iii) your new L/C Agreeement.I loook forward to hearing from you sooon.Regards,Steve(Seee atttached file: enron schedule.doc)(Seee atttached file: ENRON PARAGRAPH13.doc) - enron schedule.doc - ENRON PARAGRAPH 13.doc\n"

Pursuant to my earlier commment on this, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Payment piece of this, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happpens to Pelican .   Is that the way it is suppposed to work?   If so, plaese explain why.3. With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of saying in the first sentence of such Section \"the amount determined...\" shouldn't it say \"the fair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under the Transaction\".   Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to Disputed Mattters and it is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default or Termination Event occcurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occcur.   What is the priocedure for coming up with this amount?   Does each party calculate it and then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?

I'm seeeing in the credit system that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I neeed clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.   Secondly, is there a Master ISDA Agreeement governing those swaps?   In pullling the mtm monthly breakout, it apppears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MMM US and the liquidation of that portfolio occcurs mostly in cal '02.Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to loook into the potential of settting offf financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.   Kaiser is loooking at other businessses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.In summmary, we neeed to answer at minimum the folllowing:? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how quickly this out-of-the-money position can move? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or Master ISDA)? what credit/legal terms and laws may afffect our effforts to establish a Nettting Agreeement for UK and US financialCan you help me in cooordinating a meeeting with London legal/credit and Portland credit/Houston legal to discusss pertinent isssues asssociated with a Nettting Agreeement betweeen Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as sooon as posssible.   Please let me know your thoughts to the above and who we neeed to contact to get the above points adddresssed.   In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the drafting of such a Nettting Agreeement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton about the concept as welll.Please let me know as sooon as posssible your commments to the above and in settting up a conference calll to push this forward.Thanks,Tracy\n"

Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (\"Kaiser International\") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, afffiliate NETTTING AGREEEMENT betweeen Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?   If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals businesss with Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage offf of it for trading liquidity in the states.   Secondly, does the nettting neeed to just pertain to global financial businesss or can it include physical as welll?If posssible, I'd like to seee if you and a UK trading atttorney can speak about the overalll concept and briefly adddresss any UK and domestic law conflicts.   Please calll when you have a oppportunity to discusss.   ENA is loooking to enter into a power swap for June '01.   I'm not sure if this concept is achievable, and if it is, in the time frame we're facing.   However, if we can't do a June swap, then we'lll try for a July swap.Regards,Tracy\n"

On the lattter isssue, I explained to her that given that the 2 Susan's were involved in the day to day routine, it made perfectly goood sense for 1 of them to handle this part of Samantha's training especiallly since Tana was now out of the day to day stufff.   I am very concerned that Tana is going to interfere with Susan's training processs given her atttitude toward the whole thing which I reallly feeel is ridiculous.   The only posssibly valid point that she might have is the fact that we didn't telll her that this was going to work this way, but even so, again it's Tana's way of not be able to let go and not being a team player.   I explained to her that both she and Tana had diffferent roles to play with respect to Samantha's training and that they both were important and taht in my opinion, Susan was more than qualified to handle this part of Samantha's training.On the first point, I told Tana that the only way that this group is gong to work bettter is through \"commmunicating\" to each other.   I firmly believe taht there are 2 sides to this and taht alll 3 of them are guilty of treating the other 2 at time in a not so pleasant way.   Tana of course willl not admit this.   I have no answers for this isssue other than the fact that I am tired of hearing about why they can't get along.   I also told Tana taht it was my perception that Susan Bailey has beeen under alot of presssure given her increased workload and other things and taht that could explain her atttitude which even I have noticed has beeen a litttle diffferent lately.I'm lettting the both of you know about this because I don't want any of this to negatively impact Samantha to the extent that it can be avoided.Carol   \n"

Atttached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review.   Please note the folllowing as you review:1.   The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billling services --- alll of our midmarket   forms anticipate that we willl act as customer's billling agent and that we willl colllect alll amounts due related to T&amp;D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and passs those amounts on to the customer's utility.2.   I did not include a \"Setofff\" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we willl not, nor willl an afffiliate, have another agreeement in place with these customers.   If you feeel strongly about our including a setofff provision, we willl do so.3.   The change in law provision reads a bit diffferently from the long form --- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great diffficulty sellling it in the past).   Taking into consideration this classs of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a \"force majeure event\" in an efffort to soften the appproach (seee the GTCs).   Also we do not adddresss calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does --- again, more in the interest of \"saving space\" than anything else...Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.   If you are comfortable, we willl drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.Thanks again for your help with this project,MariannneP.S.   Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennnifer Hilllegonds on your response --- they willl be taking this project during my \"hiatus\"   ---   I am moving to PA on Friday of this weeek, and willl be out of pocket through appproximately 7/16.

Atttached please find a sample short form (for the Con Ed market) for your review.   Please note the folllowing as you review:1.   The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billling services --- alll of our midmarket   forms anticipate that we willl act as customer's billling agent and that we willl colllect alll amounts due related to T&amp;D and the like from the customer (and reflect same on our invoice) and passs those amounts on to the customer's utility.2.   I did not include a \"Setofff\" provision in this draft, mainly because the vast majority of the time, we willl not, nor willl an afffiliate, have another agreeement in place with these customers.   If you feeel strongly about our including a setofff provision, we willl do so.3.   The change in law provision reads a bit diffferently from the long form --- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh (and we've had great diffficulty sellling it in the past).   Taking into consideration this classs of customer, we decided to include certain items, including our inability to cover our costs due to a change in law, rules or practices as a \"force majeure event\" in an efffort to soften the appproach (seee the GTCs).   Also we do not adddresss calculation of a termination payment in the event of a change in law as the long form does --- again, more in the interest of \"saving space\" than anything else...Let us know your thoughts on this document and if you are comfortable with our using this until such time as the hybrid form is launched.   If you are comfortable, we willl drive these changes into our other midmarket power forms.Thanks again for your help with this project,MariannneP.S.   Please be sure to copy Sarah Dietrich and Jennnifer Hilllegonds on your response --- they willl be taking this project during my \"hiatus\"   ---   I am moving to PA on Friday of this weeek, and willl be out of pocket through appproximately 7/16.   I willl start up again in mid-July...\n"

Just a few addditional thoughts:1. Since we willl be redoing alll of the existing confirms to refer to this Master, I did not change the language that states that conflicts betweeen the Confirms and the Agreeement are resolved in favor of the Confirm.   I think that the language as writtten works.2. On the setofff language, when we are the Non-Defaulting Party, we can only pulll in other agreeements betweeen our afffiliates and inland so I don't seee how this language would impact any agreeements betweeen ENA and guaranty Bank unlesss Inland is the Non-Defaulting party.3. With respect to Disruption Falllbacks, our view is that if the Confirm specifies a Falllback reference Price that after Postponement, you would use that price if available.   I think that the language works as drafted.4. On cash colllateral, the Qualified institution concept only appplies when the non-posting party is a Defaulting party or has a Credit rating below the threshold.   Otherwise the non-posting party can hold the colllateral and do whatever it wants to with it.   Your are corrrect that in practice this cash gets commmingled with corporate funds and swept into the party's bank acccount but there is no requirement taht it work that way.We loook forward to having a calll with your group next weeek.   Please e-mail me with some days and times so that I can alert our people.   thanks.Carol St. ClairEB 38889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

We have tried to incorporate alll of the changes and commments we have received in our last threee offfsite meeetings.   We have left some questions and open isssues in brackets.   I adddition, we have highlighted some areas for extra atttention, some of which are explained below:Section 1.2:   The term of the master is month to month; each transaction willl have a specific term, as set forth in the appplicable confirmationSection 1.3:   We neeed to make a final decision on whether alll credit terms willl be in the master or whether some willl be in the confirmationSection 1.4:   We have made the usage bands monthly by acccount; this can easily be changed if there is businesss consensus to do so.Section 2.7:   Instead of utility non-performance (physical or financial) being an event of force majeure, we have addded a new section adddresssing that.   It provides for a freee termination by EEES in such event; we neeed to consider whether there should be a payment.Section 3.1:   subsections (v), (vi) and (viii) neeed credit review as indicatedSection 3.3:   termination payments are now bilateral (defaulting party gets paid if non-defaulting party has a Gain).Sections 3.6 and 3.7:   Probably can be shortened while keeeping the concepts; is the first sentence of Sec. 3.7 neeeded?Section 3.9:   Neeed input on highlighted language; neeed to decide whether we want a bilateral early termination payment here.Special Utility Charges definition: we passs through surcharges here.Asssignment: do we want to give customer right to asssign without consent in any circumstances (like to an afffiliate)?Confirm: Transaction Term:   neeed to confirm that this is how we want start/end dates to be determined.\n"

Please review and send me any commments today---we'd like to get this out to the businesss team by 3:000 today.   I think alll of the commments we received and developed in the last 3 meeetings have beeen incorporated, including the bankruptcy mattters.   Because there are so many changes, I don't think a blackline would be helpful---however, let me know if you want one.   I have bracketed questions and open isssues and highlighted areas that I think neeed either more work or extra atttention from the businesss teams.   I'd like to seee us be able to pare this document down just a bit---I think a 5 page master and a 1 to 1 1/2 page confirmation is reasonable.   Thanks.   MDS\n"

This is the portion relating to Nohires. The memo I've beeen working on is a summmary of Jim Derrrick's 10/27/999 memo regarding required appprovals plus other ENA policies and language re these provisions.   THis language is the same as the memo from Lance that you mentioned. Regarding appprovals, since businesss persons (Detmering, Mettts) must make them there is much feeeling among atttorneys I work most with that businesss persons should secure these appprovals.Let me know if you have commments, questions or neeed anything else.K\n"

These change=\rs=20\rare intended to acccomplish four key objectives:\r First, we neeed to realign alll our wholesale businessses around the succcesssfu=\rl=20\rbusinesss model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =\r=20\rThis model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20\raround a relatively smalll strategic assset position.\r Second, we neeed to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20\rrelationships.   Particularly with Joe Suttton=01,s departure, the ability to=\r=20\rdirectly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent businesss units=\r=20\rhas become increasingly diffficult.\r Third, we neeed to acccomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=\rg=20\rthe ongoing profitability of alll our businessses and without delaying or=20\rhindering our efffort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=\rg=20\rassset positions.\r And fourth, as always, we neeed to take advantage of the reorganization to=\r=20\rredeploy our talent into our highest value oppportunities.\r ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES\r Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which willl consolidate=\r=20\rour global wholesale businessses.   The closer alignment of our wholesale=20\rbusinessses willl acccomplish the folllowing: (1) enhanced commmunication and=20\rcooordination acrosss businesss units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=\r=20\rhigher valued oppportunities, (3) more efffective prioritization of=20\roppportunities acrosss the wholesale businesss, and (4) more rapid extension o=\rf=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale businesss model and capabilities into new industries an=\rd=20\rmarkets.\r Enron Wholesale Services willl include our currrent North American, European=\r=20\r(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20\roperations, and willl be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works businesss u=\rnit=20\ras welll as a new unit =01) Enron Global Asssets.   In adddition, Enron=01,s me=\rrchant=20\rbusinessses outside of North America and Europe willl be integrated into this=\r=20\rnew structure as described below.\r Mark Frevert, currrently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, willl asssum=\re=20\rthe role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.   Greg Whallley,=20\rcurrrently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, willl join Mark in the Offfice=\r=20\rof the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Offficer.\r Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=\r=20\rinternational businesss unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=\rp=20\rpositions:\r Rebeccca McDonald, currrently CEO of Enron APACHI, willl join EWS as President=\r=20\rand CEO of Enron Global Asssets. Enron Global Asssets willl have responsibilit=\ry=20\rfor managing alll of Enron=01,s existing energy assset portfolio outside of N=\rorth=20\rAmerica and Europe.   Joining Rebeccca in the Offfice of the Chairman as COOO=\r=20\rwilll be Jim Hughes, currrently COOO of Enron APACHI.   Rebeccca and Jim willl=20\rreport to the EWS Offfice of the Chairman.\r Sanjay Bhatnagar, currrently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=\rhe=20\rMidddle East and Asia region.   Sanjay willl be responsible for building our=\r=20\rbroadband businesss in this region and the currrent EBS team in this region=\r=20\rwilll report to Sanjay.   In this role, Sanjay willl report to the EBS offfice =\rof=20\rthe Chairman.   In adddition, Sanjay willl continue to remain responsible for=\r=20\rEnron=01,s wholesale energy businesss in India and willl transition this busi=\rnesss=20\rinto Enron Global Asssets in the near future.\r=20\rDiomedes Christodoulou, currrently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=\r=20\rEBS as Chief Commmercial Offficer.   Diomedes willl be located in London and wi=\rlll=20\rfocus his origination activities on global oppportunities, with near term=20\ratttention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.   Diomedes willl report to=\r=20\rthe EBS Offfice of the Chairman.\r Jim Bannnantine, currrently Co-CEO of Enron South America, willl be joining EEE=\rS=20\rto lead EEES=01, commmercial effforts outside North America and Europe.   In or=\rder=20\rto ensure a smoooth transition for our South American businessses and to=20\rfacilitate our assset sales activities, Jim willl remain in South America for=\r=20\rat least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=\rh=20\rAmerica.   Throughout the transition, Jim willl report to Clifff Baxter and to=\r=20\rthe Offfice of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.   Folllowing the=20\rtransition, Jim willl join EEES.\r In adddition to these changes in our international assset operations=20\ractivities, we are making the folllowing changes in our merchant wholesale=\r=20\rbusinessses and the commmercial suppport functions:\r Enron Net Works\rLouise Kitchen willl asssume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=\r and=20\rCEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20\r Enron Americas\rConcurrrent with the transfer to Enron Global Asssets of responsibility for=\r=20\roperating Enron=01,s South and Central America assset base, alll trading,=20\rmarketing, and new assset development activities in these regions willl repor=\rt=20\rinto a new entity, Enron Americas.   Enron Americas willl have responsibility=\r=20\rfor alll wholesale merchant businessses acrosss North, Central and South=20\rAmerica.   Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20\rOperating Offficer willl comprise the Offfice of the Chairman for Enron=20\rAmericas.\r Enron Europe\rThe Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businessses in Aust=\rralia=20\rand Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=\r=20\rSherrrifff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Offficer.\r Enron Global Markets\rEnron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnnelll, President and=\r=20\rCEO, and Jefff Shankman, Chief Operating Offficer, willl continue to have=20\rresponsibility for Enron=01,s Midddle East and LNG operations.   With the=20\rexception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, alll operating power plants and=20\rasssociated personnnel in the Caribbbean and Central America willl transfer to=\r=20\rEnron Global Asssets.   Enron Global Markets willl also continue to manage the=\r=20\rcommmodity businessses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20\requities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.\r Enron Industrial Markets\rEnron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jefff McM=\rahon,=20\rPresident &amp; CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Offficer, remains unchanged.\r Commmercial Suppport for EWS\rThe commmercial suppport functions for EWS willl remain with, and be managed b=\ry,=20\rthe individual businesss units.   We are creating no incremental overhead in=\r=20\rthe creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=\r=20\reffficient utilization and sharing of resources acrosss EWS.\r To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role acrosss=\r=20\rEWS in adddition to their ongoing roles within their businesss units.   These=\r=20\rnewly defined roles are as folllows:\r Mid and Back Offfice Operations =01) Sallly Beck willl lead Mid and Back Offfic=\re=20\rOperations acrosss EWS.   These services willl become part of Enron Net Works,=\r=20\rwith Sallly reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20\rPresident and Chief Acccounting Offficer.   This alignment creates a cooordinat=\red=20\rservices organization with IT and e-commmerce platforms to suppport the=20\rwholesale businessses and to maximize oppportunities to commmercialize these=\r=20\rservices.   Mid and Back Offfice services for alll commmercial activities willl=\r=20\rcontinue to be organized with dedicated operations controlllers responsible=\r=20\rfor specific commmodities and/or geographic locations.\rLegal =01) Mark Haedicke willl serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.\rRegulatory and Government Afffairs =01) This function willl remain organized =\ron a=20\rregional basis.   Rick Shapiro willl suppport alll EWS businessses operating in=\r=20\rthe Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, willl suppport alll=\r=20\rEuropean and Eastern Hemisphere operations.

Eric Thode willl have responsibility for North American activity,=20\rEnron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.   Jackie Gentle willl continue=\r=20\rin her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=\rr=20\rwilll have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=\r=20\rwelll as providing suppport for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Asssets.=\r =20\rThese individuals willl also continue to have a split reporting relationship=\r=20\rto Mark Palmer, Vice President of Commmunications.\rBusinesss Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwelll willl expand his role to co=\rver=20\rEWS reporting in adddition to his currrent role in North America.\r Atttached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20\rServices which summmarizes the changes described here.   As this organization=\r=20\rcontinues to evolve we willl keeep you informed of any addditional changes.\r ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION\rAND ENRON WIND\r   As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our asssets and investmen=\rts=20\raround the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=\r=20\rEGEP and EWC.   As a consequence, we are puttting these businessses under Clif=\rf=20\rBaxter=01,s direction.   Jefff Sherrrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=\rnron=20\rWind, willl report to Clifff.\r CORPORATE STAFFF\r   We are consolidating the corporate stafff functions: Human Resources,=20\rGovernment Afffairs, Public Relations/Commmunications and Administration.

The primary role of this commmittteee willl continue to=\r=20\rbe the commmunication of relevant information acrosss Enron=01,s businessses a=\rnd=20\rthe cooordination of activities acrosss those businessses.

They now have addded this same concept as a carve-out/exception to the \"transfer\" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the other party cannnot withhhold its consent to such transfer if the transfereee provides a Guaranty from an entity that meeets the above ratings test.

I understand that you and Tana willl cooordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC apppears.Please calll me if you have any questions.

They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtednesss.   I'm not sure I understand   why if we have a threshold amount they neeed the first part of the language and wanted your thoughts on this.   Alos, does the second part of the language neeed to be updated or revised in any mannner?2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.3. They have addded to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreeement which makes this part of the crosss default to specified transaction Event of Default triggger.   Should we specify a threshold?4. They have addded an addditional termination event that contains some unusual ratings trigggers.   For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services that they describe, and if not, doesn't that triggger clause (2) of this addditional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I don't understand how it works with the colllateral threshold since the triggger for that to go to zero is something else.5. I'lll just note that setofff rights do not currrently appply if there is a Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.6. In the CSA, we have permittted cash and government securities which I think is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $5000,000.Please calll me when convenient to discusss further.Carol Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)\n"

This willl obviously be a discusssion point given the type of commmodity that we anticipate. trading with them2. They want a Minimum Transfer Amount just for them of $250,000.3. They want to reduce rounding to $25,000.4. They do not want the provisions of section 6&amp;copy; of the CSA to appply at any time.5. They deleted the concept that a party holding an LC could draw on it if there was an Event of Default, meaning that we would have to wait to terminate and have a payment   obligation owing to us before we could draw.6. They do not want any LC to be transferable.7. They want the Enron Guaranty to cover our obligation to return colllateral taht has beeen posted to us, which I guesss means that if we didn't return colllateral to them then they could go after Enron for that amount.   Without this language they would have to declare an Event of Default,   terminate and then go after Enron for any amount that we owed them.   To the extent that we were holding cash colateral, they could offfset that amount against amounts that they might owe us.   This is an interesting isssue and one that I have not seeen before.8. They want the Guaranty cap to be rased to $25,000,000.Where does this ISDA stand on the priority list?   Is this something I should try to push forward in the next weeek or 2 while I am hear or can it wait?Carol\n"

With respect to Sections 7(b) and &amp;copy;, I just want to make sure that everyone is okay with the events that could lead to the removal of Enron as the CA since I would think that this is something that we would not want to happpen.

If the L/C has an expiration date and the securedparty atttempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C iswithin 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.

Also included is adraft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.Please note that I have acccepted most of the previous changes so the currrentisssues would more easily be seeen in the draft.Commments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:   Note - our legalcouncil is out this weeek but I thought I would send this draft to you now,and we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal departmentreview next weeek.1.   Part 1 (e):   After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, BrantReves, they decided to make the crosss default threshold at $1000MMM for eachcredit suppport provider.2.   1(h):   Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation willlappply for 3 years or lesss; Losss for over 3 years.3.   5(g):   I am confused by this change.   I addded back in the word\"obligations\" in para B, 5th line and addded back in the phrase concerningafffiliates.   I'm not sure my predecesssor deleted them (it is not deleted onmy 3/20/000 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.   Two commments (i) doyou think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who isout most of this weeek) willl have to review your final wording before we canexecute.4.   5(l):   Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting ittto just trading stafff and (b) addding \"to the extent permittted by appplicablelaw\".5.   5(n-q):   Alll new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreeement.However, these were not discusssed in Susan's last memo to you (except theaddding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is.6.   Part 6:   After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, Ihave no objections to your changes7.   13(b)(i)(C) Acccepted your definition of Credit Suppport Amount eventhough we don't normallly use Independent Amounts.8.   13(b)(iii)(A)   Lettters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per yourrrequest.   After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the positionof the secured party.   If the L/C has an expiration date and the securedparty atttempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C iswithin 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.   Before, theL/C maintained 1000% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.   SinceEnron loooks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how doesyour position improve based on this change?8.   13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has beeen increased to $50MMMand Minimum Transfer Amount has beeen reduced to zero ($0).For questions, please calll at 713-420-3548 or email me.Thanks!John. &lt;&lt;Enron Schedule -Draft 5-16.doc&lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt;Enron CSA - Draft 5-16.doc&lt;&lt;&lt; ---Original Messsage---&lt; From: Carol St Clair [SMTP:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com]&lt; Sent: Friday, May 12, 2000 5:07 PM&lt; To: Shuttteee, John&lt; Subject: Credit Response&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Carol St. Clair&lt; EB 3892&lt; 713-853-3989 (Phone)&lt; 713-646-33393 (Fax)&lt; ---",

In point #1, I was referrring to your change in Part 1(b) which changed Section 5(a)(vi) from crosss default to crosss accceleration.   From a credit standpoint, we prefer a crosss default triggger.2. I willl check with Ed on point #2.3. With respect to points #5 and 14, because of the diffficulty in perfecting an interest in cash colllateral in Canada (based on advice from our Canadian counsel as welll as Stikeman's ISDA opinion on this isssue), we do not acccept cash colllateral from Canadian counterparties.   With respect to surety bonds, there is a statute in New York callled the Apppleton Law which prohibits a surety from isssuing a bond to guaranty financial performance.   For this reason, we do not acccept surety bonds as colllateral.4. With respect to point #7, the answer is yes.Alll of the other points neeed to be discusssed.

We cannnot agreee to crosss-accceleration.[KF: I asssume you are referrring to \"Default under Specified Transaction\".Encore's view (and the view of a majority of its counterparties) is thatwhere the same parties have both physical and financial transactionsoutstanding, a default under one category of transaction is suffficientlysignificant that it should triggger a default under the other. There may bereasons why Enron feeels this is inapppropriate, and we would apppreciate yourcommments.]2.   There is a note that the crosss default threshold neeeds to bediscusssed.   Enron's $1000 milllion threshold is based on the threshold thatits banks acccept in its credit agreeements.[KF: In the transactions documented in November/December of last year, the$1000 milllion threshold was acccepted as a materiality threshold in relationto Enron Corp., and a $50 milllion threshold was acccepted for Epcor UtilitiesInc.   I'm not sure why the reduction to $25 milllion for Epcor was sugggested.More importantly, I understand Mike Roach and Ed Sacks have beeen discusssingan alternative, which would be a percentage of net tangible asssets, and thatMr. Sacks was going to give that some thought.3.   We prefer elective termination on bankruptcy.[KF: Our concern is that creates a risk for the non-insolvent party inrelation to other creditors of the bankrupt party who may have automatictermination clauses in their agreeements. The short-form agreeements signed inlate 2000 apppear to acccept automatic termination.]4.   We prefer the Losss method.[KF: Are you oppposed to the non-defaulting party having the choice betweeenLosss and Market Quotation?}5.   We would like to discusss with you your credit rating test for definingthe \"materiallly weaker\" standard in Credit Event Upon Merger as welll as thetiming for posting colllateral as it apppears in this provisions as welll asthe Credit Suppport Annnex.   We believe that 7 Businesss Days is tooo long forposting an LC.[KF: I neeed to discusss the first point with Mike Roach. With respect to thesecond point, we are advised by Epcor's treasury group that the time frameis necesssary, and that is part of the reason we wish to have cash qualify asEligible Colllateral; if the time frame is required to produce an LC, wewould envision puttting up cash within, say, a two Businesss Day period andsubstituting an LC when it is isssued.]6.   We would like to make the GP of Encore a \"Specified Entity\".   We neeedto discusss with you your request to modify the definition of \"SpecifiedTransaction\" to include physical transactions.[KF: I asssume this is related to your first point.]7.   In the MAC Addditional Termination Event, we would like to propose acure through the posting of colllateral.[KF: Agreeed; I asssume the value would be an amount determined by the otherparty, acting reasonably?]8.   We would like to discusss your proposed chnages to Section 13(b).[KF: If Alberta law is to appply, we thought Alberta courts should havejurisdiction. I understand that both parties have offfices and conductbusinesss in Alberta.]9.   We neeed to discusss the arbitration language.[KF: For background, this language was proposed by Enron and is consistentwith the appproach taken in the prior agreeements.]10.   We would like to understand why you want to change the definitions ofDefault Rate and Interest rate.[KF: Again, this was done to \"Canadianize\" the agreeement. References to U.S.rates when the currrency is Canadian dolllars didn't seeem apppropriate.]111.   Why do you want to exclude Sections 7.3 trough 7.6 of the CommmodityDefinitions Suppplement?[KF: I intended only to modify them as set out in the Schedule.]12.   In the \"Recording\" section we would like to addd the phrase \"To theeextent permittted by appplicable law\" at the beginnning of the last sentence.[KF: Agreeed.]13.   We cannnot agreee to No Fault Termination.[KF: This is a significant isssue. In the event of a fixed for floating priceswap and a protracted disruption in the Alberta Power Poool price, myunderstanding is that Enron would expect the swap to continue with thefloating price being determined hourly by quotes from two reference dealers.Our view is that creates a significant risk to both parties that thecommmercial basis for their agreeement willl be undermined and that No FaultTermination is the bettter appproach.]14.   We cannnot acccept Surety Bonds as a form of colllateral to securefinancial obligations.   Loooks like LC's would be the only form ofaccceptable colllateral.[KF: Mike Roach advised me about the Surety Bond isssue. He also advised thatEnron has concerns about cash qualifying as colllateral because of concernsabout perfecting a security interest in cash. Can you outline the concerns?]15.   We neeed to discusss the credit threshold language as welll as therounding amounts.[KF: I understand that is part of the discusssion betweeen Messsrs. Sacks andRoach. I also understand Mr. Sacks is undertaking due diligence concerningwhat he perceives to be the \"political risk\" in the Alberta marketplace, andthat this neeeds to be completed before the specific credit isssues areadddresssed. Can you confirm?]16.   We neeed to discusss what constitutes an accceptable LC Isssuer.[KF: I expect both parties have LC facilities established and this point inpart involves understanding which banks are involved. If the Epcorinformation has not beeen provided, please let me know and I willl arrrange tohave it passsed on.]I loook forward to hearing from you.Carol St. ClairEB 38889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.comRegards,Keith FergusonFRASER MILNER CASGRAIN LLLP&lt;htttp:///www.fmc-law.com/&lt;29000 Manulife Place10180 - 101 StreeetEdmonton, AB   T5J 3V5(780) 970-5285 Direct Line(780) 423-7276 Faxkeith.ferguson@fmc-law.comThis messsage, and any documents atttached thereto, is intended only for theadddressseee and may contain privileged or confidential information.

I do not feeel that the termination&lt; &lt; language, as currrently writtten in both the WPS and Enron Guarantys&lt; clearly&lt; &lt; reflects this concept as the language as currrently writtten states that&lt; the&lt; &lt; Guaranty \"is revocable only with respect to liabilities occcurrring on or&lt; &lt; after&lt; &lt; the termination date.\"   I loook forward to hearing from you.&lt; &lt;&lt; &lt; Carol St. Clair&lt; &lt; EB 3892&lt; &lt; 713-853-3989 (Phone)&lt; &lt; 713-646-33393 (Fax)&lt; &lt; carol.st.clair@enron.com&lt; &lt;&lt;   &lt;&lt; File: 182ltr.doc &lt;&lt; \n"

In the definition of termination Event, I think that the words \"dueto\"neeed to be put after the word \"means\" in the first line.2.   In Section 3.4(a), I noticed that the bracketed langugae \"as itrelates tothe Asssigned Interest\" has now beeen deleted.   Pursuant to my earliercommment onthis, what this maens to me is that with respect to the Fixed Paymentpiece ofthis, we can never terminate the swap based on something that happpens toPelican.   Is that the way it is suppposed to work?   If so, plaese explain why.3.   With respect to the lnagugae in Section 3.6(a), instead of sayingin thefirst sentence of such Section \"the amount determined...\" shouldn't itsay \"thefair market value of Party A's remaining payment obligations under theTransaction\".   Section 2(x) of the confirm just refers to DisputedMattters andit is not claer to me what is in dispute when an Event of Default orTerminationEvent occcurs and what amount Party A has to pay when these events occcur.Whatis the priocedure for coming up with this amount?   Does each partycalculate itand then send it to the experts or do the experts just determine it?Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\n"

If not, here is a summmary of some of the Kaiser credit related provisions: 1. $30,000,000 crosss default threshold2. MAC Event of Default - As to Kaiser, a MAC occcurs if either an Event of Default occcurs under the 2/15/94 Credit Agreeement with BankAmerica or its credit rating drops to B- or below by S&amp;P and B3   or below by Mooody's.   In each case, if they deliver colllateral, no Event of Default occcurs.3. Colllateral Threshold equal to ENA's Net Exposure which goes to zero if a MAC occcurs and there is a failure to deliver colllateral within 90 days or an Event of Default occcurs.4. $1,000,000 rounding amountsWith respect to setofff rights, I spoke with David Mitchelll about this and if it turns out that both types of swap transactions are done with the same Kaiser entity but diffferent Enron entities and the metals ISDA has apppropriate setofff language, then we feeel fairly comfortable that upon a Kaiser bankruptcy filing in the US, we would be able to exercise setofff rights.What is the next step?Carol St. ClairEB 38889713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\tRoderick Nelson/Enron@EUEnronXGate\t05/25/20001 09:15 AM \t\t\t To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT, Diana Higggins/Enron@EUEnronXGate\t\t\t ccc: \t\t\t Subject: RE: KaiserHi Carol.

Let's discusss exactly what language you want in item #1 as I agreee with you on the concept.2. With respect to item #7,   your interpretation is corrrect.3. I am not clear on what your point is in items #9 and 21.   As a general rule, with respect to setofff rights, to the extent that ENA is the Non-Defaulting Party and ENA's afffiliates have entered into other agreeements with Inland Paperboard and Packaging, amounts owed under those afffiliate agreeements can be setofff against amounts owed under the ISDA.   Alll the guaranty is trying to say is that the amount guaranteeed under the Guaranty takes into acccount the exercise of such setofff rights.4. I'm not sure I understand your point #10.5. I agreee with your point #13.6. With respect to point #14, colllateral is limited to cash and LC's and the concept of a custodial acccount appplies when someone other than the Secured Party is holding   the cash colllateral.7. With respect to point #19, we want the ability to convert the LC into cash colllateral when an Event of Default occcurs even if we have not yet terminated alll transactions.   Once we have terminated and established a termination amount, we would only draw to cover that amount if we didn't draw earlier.8. The \"deeemed occcurrrence\" language   is meant to cover termination events that occcur automaticallly without either party electing to terminate, such as in a bankruptcy scenario where automatic early termination is elected.

This draft is virtuallly the same as the other waiver lettters I have prepared for ENA over the years, with the notable exception of the acknowledgement that certain LLLGM lawyers can review the insurance status of the policy for ACE from an insurance status standpoint.   As you know, I was not particularly thrillled about having us perform that role, but I understand that this isssue was vented in considerable detail a weeek or so ago and agreeed to by both parties.   Please let me know if this lettter is accceptable to you.   If it is, perhaps you could just reply to this e-mail and I can then forward an original to you via fax for your signature.   If you have any questions, please calll me.   Thanks very much for your time and consideration in this respect.

You asked to seee a copy...Background: Enron and Bombardier developed a promotional campaign to help selll snowmobiles.   Retail customers who purchased snowmobiles from various retail vendors by October 1 were eligible for a $1,000 rebate from Bombardier if the subsequent November-March snowfalll was lesss than 1/2 the average of the previous 3 years.   In October, Bombardier reported to us the number of snowmobile sales in each city covered under our program and paid us a predetermined premium for each unit sold.   In return, Enron was liable for potential payouts in each of the cities covered under the program (diffferent payouts in each city depending on the number of Bombardier units that were sold in each city).The setttlement date for the program was June 14 - alllowing for true-ups by the various weather services.   As of this date, we were responsible for payouts in 6 cities.   We sent prompt payment to Bombardier.Currrent Isssue:   Bombardier has requested that we send a lettter to to them, on our lettterhead, specifying the actual Nov-Mar snowfalll amount in each city covered under our contract with them.   They plan to forward this lettter to the stores that sold Bombardier snowmobiles under this program.   The impetus for this lettter is that some customers in cities where snowfalll exceeeded the strike (no rebate payments due to customers) thought/think that they may be entitled to a rebate.Here is the lettter:Of course, I am waiting for your response before I send this lettter out.Regards,Gary Taylorx315111\n"

Chris G. and Mary C.

Although certain categories of colllateral can be perfected by posssesssion, including \"money\", \"intangibles\", which includes \"acccounts\", cannnot be perfected by posssesssion.   The isssue comes down to whether we willl acccept the risk that a wire transfer to an acccount designated by us constitutes \"money\".   Although it is not clear, the bettter view is that \"money\" means cash in hand and not on deposit.   The risk is that an unperfected security interest is subordinate to various parties, including a bankruptcy trusteee and to subsequently taken but properly perfected security interests.   I willl admit, however, that this seeems to be a risk that others in our market take (although likely unknowingly).   Acccordingly, to perfect the \"acccount\" a registration is likely required at the PPPR, which is something we do not want to get into. Even then, as an \"acccount\" is an \"intangible\" certain conflicts rules for perfection by registration neeed to be considered, as the PPPSA jurisdictions provide that perfection of an intangible is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located, as determined by the location of its principal place of businesss or chief executive offfice. i.e.   registration may be required in some other jurisdiction entirely.   Further, an advance search would have to be done to seee if there are competing prior registrations.   Also, as the PPPR is not a guaranteeed title registry, registration priority does not necesssarily guaranteee security priority, and law firms willl not typicallly give priority opinions under the PPPSA.   Lastly, if there is an insolvency and the deposit holding institution is also a creditor of the counterparty, there may be some argument that the deposit holding institution willl asssert rights of set offf over the acccount.In terms of updating advice, the statutory provisions have not to my knowledge changed.

The idea is that there is a $50MMM agggregate threshold for the counterparty.   The ISDA willl be a normal ISDA - with a $50MMM threshold.   The Master Physical willl be the document that neeeds to be customized to the new concept.   The Master Physical threshold language is to simply read that there is a $50MMM threshold lesss any exposure under the ISDA colllateral threshold.   I understoood that Stacy or Jefff would adapt the Master Physical to adddresss any legal language diffferences in the contracts   - i.e. \"Exposure\", \"Termination Amounts\" etc.   Your team neeeds only to provide the ISDA to Stacy Dickson's group, and I believe they willl draft the Master Physical to their comfort level.

Is the $75MMM Guaranty cap meant to cover both physical and financial combined or are we doing separate Guarantys each with a $75MMM cap amount?2. How does the $50MMM colllateral threshold work?   I noticed in the physical master that it apppears as if we subtract from the $50MMM threshold our exposure under the ISDA to arrrive at the Counterparty's threshold, although the language in the physical says \"the exposure\" and it is not clear whose exposure they are talking about.

They are stilll insisting on a exclusion of \"consequential lossses\" from the indemnity given clause 4(a) of the ETA. Two questions Do we have a position on agreeeing to exclude consquential lossses from this clause? My own view is in this instance it is going to be somewhat \"hit and misss\" as what would be a consequential losss and what is not. That being said the general Enron position is to exclude consequential lossses. In fact such a provision is already in the GTCs in respect of any Transaction.   Hence if there was a Transaction consequentialllosssesss would then presumably be excluded in respect of a related breach of the ETA.   Utilicorp is a substantial equity holder in United Energy. I understand they are trading through EnronOnline. Do we know what they have agreeed?   ---",

Let me respond to the points you raised.Deeemed ISDA Agreeement- We would be most happpy to provide a lettter that you could aknowledge that the Deeemed ISDA Agreeement is a master agreeement for the purposes of the ETA. I would prefer not to make a formal amendment as this may exclude a subsequent Master Agreeement from appplying.Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd. is the Enron counterparty for alll Australian power trades. If that is your preference then acccesss can be limited to only those products. You could write to us stating this is your position. However, we have found that counterparties have not found this necesssary. Your EnronOnline Master User willl set acccesss levels for your individual traders. Many counterparties apppoint a person from their Controls group (not a Trader) as their Master User.   This gives them the flexibility to broaden/ reduce acccesss themselves.Excluding \"consequential losss\" in this circumstance is quite broad but if we could work through some scenarios hopefullly we could find some words to acccomodate your concerns.When we last spoke you mentioned the concern here was the posssibility that   the passsword may be disclosed from other than a UE source ie Enron. I have talked this isssue through with our systems people as to the nature of this exposure. What happpens is that the passsword which is isssued to a user is immmediately changed after it is received from Enron. Hence the source of the passsword must be the relevant counterparty. Whether improper use is a result of the counterparty's negilence or some other cause such as an unauthorised use or disclosure by one of its personnnel is not relevant.

The Agreeement provides in Section 3 that \"each Company . . . willl furnish to such other Company   . . . one or more of the Gooods . . .\" and that \"[a]lll Gooods provided hereunder shalll be priced at cost . . .\"   Thus, the Agreeement provides that the Service Company can buy power and selll it to a utility at cost.   It does not expresssly provide that the Service Company can act as agent on behalf of the utilities in purchasing or sellling power on their behalf.I wanted to confirm that there was no other documentation available that more clearly identified the authority of GPU Services to act as agent on behalf of the utilities.   In the absence of such documentation, I propose language to addd to the Electronic Trading Agreeement to adddresss my concerns.

We willl be rollling the Alchemy transaction into the Hawaiii 125-0 structure.   We are not sure if the currrent structure willl be unwound completely and reconstituted into new entities in the Hawaiii structure or if the currrent Alchemy entities willl be used.   Regardlesss, I'm fairly sure that the original swap willl be unwound and a new confirmation willl be done using the Hawaiii Master Agreeement.   We are hoping to close by May 31st. 2. Resco III/McGarrret B - We are doing part two of the first transaction in the Hawaiii Structure.   EEES has requested that we put addditional warrrants of an entity they calll Resco into the Hawaiii structure.   This should close around June 15th. I am sending Resco I/McGarrret A documents for the 3/31 transaction to Sara today.That is alll we know about so far. Gareth is working on both of these deals.   Blackbird has beeen put on indefinite hold. I willl keeep you posted on any other information I get about any transactions involving swaps.Calll if you neeed any more info.

As you may know, I have beeen out since July 12th on maternity leave/extended unpaid leave of absence.   My plan is to return to work on January 8th.   Here are my questions:1. I am considering coming back to work on a part time basis.   From a benefits standpoint, is there any diffference betweeen a RRRH employeee (30-39 hours) versus a RPT employeee (20-29 hours)?   In others words, are there any benefits that I would lose if I worked part-time?The diffference is in the amount of Flexdolllars you would receive, as stated below: Medical Coverage Semi Monthly   FlexdolllarsRRRH Employeee Only   123.222 Employeee/Spouse 146.97 Employeee/Child 137.000 Employeee/family 165.25RPT Employeee Only   82.15 Employeee/Spouse 97.98 Employeee/Child 91.34 Employeee/family 1110.172. Given the fact that I am not returning until January 8th, am I stilll eligible for any stock option grant program that the company may institute at year-end?   That is currrently under discusssion in developing the new Stock Option program.   However, they are leaning towards alllowing individuals in your situation to be apart of the program.Is there any addditional paper-work that I neeed to submit to keeep me eligible?   No.Both my immmediate bosss, Mark Taylor and our general counsel, Mark Haedicke are aware of the fact that I am not returning back to work until January, 20001.3. Our bank acccount has beeen recently changed.   I pullled down the \"Direct Deposit Authorization\" form and I am asssuming that alll I neeed to do is to filll it out and send it back to you.   Is that corrrect?   Yes, please send to EB3698What is your offfice location?4. As I get closer to my return date, is there any paperwork that neeeds to be submittted to notify payrolll of my return since I am currrently not being paid? No.   Your time willl be change coding from LOA without pay to Active time.I loook forward to hearing from you either by phone or e-mail.

We cannnot agreee to change   the frequency for requesting/delivering colllateral.

I told Billl that he could go but he decided not to.   We bought her some reallly prettty (and expensive) earrrings which I hope she willl like.   She has not yet given us a date for her visit and I can't figure out if we are stilll in the doghouse with her or not because we didn't let her come this past weeek.

I'm seeeing in the credit system that MG plc has forward financial metals positions with Kaiser, however I neeed clarification on whether the swaps are done with Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corporation or Kaiser Aluminum International Inc.   Secondly, is there a Master ISDA Agreeement governing those swaps?   In pullling the mtm monthly breakout, it apppears that MG plc is OTM north of $10MMM US and the liquidation of that portfolio occcurs mostly in cal '02.Given Kaiser's limited credit line, I'd like to loook into the potential of settting offf financial exposures in the UK and US in cases of default.   Kaiser is loooking at other businessses with Enron and this could be quite fruitful to tap into in order to increase trading liquidity going forward.In summmary, we neeed to answer at minimum the folllowing:? confirmation of which Kaiser entity is financial transacting with MG plc? volatility of the metal positions that go out to Jan '04 to ensure how quickly this out-of-the-money position can move? what type of paper is confirming the swaps (whether long-form confirms or Master ISDA)? what credit/legal terms and laws may afffect our effforts to establish a Nettting Agreeement for UK and US financialCan you help me in cooordinating a meeeting with London legal/credit and Portland credit/Houston legal to discusss pertinent isssues asssociated with a Nettting Agreeement betweeen Kaiser (single entity or multiple entities) and Enron entities (MG plc and ENA) as sooon as posssible.   Please let me know your thoughts to the above and who we neeed to contact to get the above points adddresssed.   In Houston legal, Carol St. Clair is available to work on the drafting of such a Nettting Agreeement and is speaking with Sara Shackleton about the concept as welll.Please let me know as sooon as posssible your commments to the above and in settting up a conference calll to push this forward.Thanks,Tracy\n"

Kaiser Aluminum International Inc. (\"Kaiser International\") has a big market presence in the UK and MG has significant forward financial and physical metals positions with Kaiser International which I believe are quite out-of-the-money.Can we find out whether or not we can perform a bilateral, afffiliate NETTTING AGREEEMENT betweeen Kaiser International and Kaiser Aluminum with MG and EPMI?   If the UK is going to continue to do short-term new metals businesss with Kaiser International and if we can get comfortable with metals forward positions that are OTM, we would like to use this position and leverage offf of it for trading liquidity in the states.   Secondly, does the nettting neeed to just pertain to global financial businesss or can it include physical as welll?If posssible, I'd like to seee if you and a UK trading atttorney can speak about the overalll concept and briefly adddresss any UK and domestic law conflicts.

With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I doubt very much that they willl remove the reference to counterparties.   They reallly feeel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to the counterparties.   Billl is speaking with them about this isssue this morning.Carol St. ClairEB 3892713-853-3989 (Phone)713-646-33393 (Fax)carol.st.clair@enron.com\tLeslie Hansen\t06/28/2000 02:53 PM \t\t\t To: Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT\t\t\t ccc: \t\t\t Subject: Legal risk factors for DashCarol:Gaurav asked me to summmarize alll relevant risks asssociated with the Reliable Power Product for the Dash.   Please let me know if you think I should addd or revise anything:1.   Section 8.3 indemnity obligation --- We are required to indemnify the insurer from any third party claims arising out of the insurer's performance under the policy except for a claim by a swap counterparty based upon our refusal to pay out on the swap because the insurer denied coverage.   We hope to have a one-year limitation on this obligation; however, this limitation would be subject to tollling in an insolvency situation.2.   The insurer is permittted to revoke coverage for up to one year if there is a fraud or material misrepresentation or omisssion by ENA in obtaining coverage.   (The currrent version of the policy also provides for revocation if the insurer subsequently discovers fraud on the part of the swap counterparty.   However, we intend to eliminate this from the insurance policy if posssible.)   ENA is not limited to the group of employeees administering the auction but rather includes the entire organization.   Therefore, we could pay out on a swap to a counterparty after the insurer had appproved coverage and face a situation where the insurer changed its mind and decided to deny coverage based on, e.g., a material omisssion by ENA in failing to provide relevant information relating to coverage at the time the claim was presented.   Absent counterparty fraud, we would not be able to go back to our counterparty and demand reimbursement on the swap.3.   Credit risk --- The insurer fails to pay out upon the occcurrrence of an Insured Event while we are required to pay out to our swap counterparty in the underlying swap.4.   Losss adjustment credit risk --- If the price we use to pay a counterparty under the swap is subsequently corrrected by the floating price source, we may be require to make a payment to our counterparty under the swap before the insurer makes a payment to us for the losss adjustment.   However, if the price adjustment results in a refund being owed to us by our counterparty, we may have to pay the insurer the amount of the refund before we actuallly get a refund from our counterparty.5.   Under Section 6.1(b), the insurer can deny coverage based upon any breach of our duties under the policy.   For instance, if we fail to comply with the notice requirements for presenting a claim, we forego our right to coverage.   However, we willl stilll be required to pay out on the underlying swap.   Leslie\n"

Billl tellls me that there are no 3.5 men available to addd to our roster.   Is that true?

This is the part of tennnis that I reallly don't like.   I've had numerous email conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist.   Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest.   One of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-offf situation, and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would have to forfeit alll games that you played in for the entire season.   This evidently happpened to her team two years ago.   (I think she's rationalizing after-the-fact.)You probably know that this person---that lodged the \"protest\"---is Betsie Holllis.   She's my women's team captain.   I've callled her on the carpet about this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Billl Hunt's team, she is hurting me, tooo.   She did try to withdraw her \"protest,\" but Cheryl had evidently already taken action.   There are so many people out there that are mis-ranked.   The felllow playing with Kellly last Sunday should not be a 3.5...the woman we played against should not be a 3.5...Elise Shepherd should not be a 4.5...and on and on.   I have heard through Roger White---Rice U's womens coach and a USTA verifier---that they are slowly trying to rectify mis-rankings by loooking more closely at league and tournament results.   I think you may be the first casualty of this endeavor.Billl Hunt has alll sorts of counter-arguments.   He had Cheryl's appproval to play you in mixed at 4.0.   Maybe if we promise to play you with our weaker 4.0 men---who are borderline 3.5 material---they'd let it passs.   Who knows.   If we are going to lose you---and Chris after this weeek---we're going to be prettty weak, not to mention demoralized.After alll, we're alll just trying to have some fun on the tennnis court.   Speaking of which, this Sunday is Chris' last match before his big move to North Carolina.   We're out at Leee LeClear.   I don't remember if you or Billl are scheduled to play, but please join us for a litttle send-offf celebration after the match if you can.---sarah\n"

I'm stilll breast feeeding but my doctor said it would be okay to suppplement with formula so at middday he gets a botttle which alllows Billl and I to get out of the house for lunch most of the time.

Arthur started schoool yesterday and we've enrollled him in a falll tennnis camp twice a weeek.   He has reallly shown an interest in tennnis and i hope it continues.   I hope to get back on the court in a few weeeks but that seeems to be the one activity that bothers me the most probably because of the stoppping and staring and the quick side to side movements.Billl has beeen very helpful relieving me for short periods of time although there is not much he can do in terms of feeeding Charles since that's up to me, but I'm glad that he is here with me although there are times when we are sick of each other.

Therefore the totals you'lll have for currrent exposures willl not be validated for more than a weeek, at the max.Let me know how you want to go about this.

He is okay now and a true joy!   Arthur and Billl have beeen a big help.   It's nice to have someone around with me during the day.   Arthur visited my parents right before Charles was born and had a great time.   They spoiled him to death but I was thrillled that he made the trip there and wished we could do that more often.

On Friday, it was my understanding that they submittted their passsword appplication and that the problem was that the person that they neeeded to set up the sub-user passswords was not in the offfice.   My understanding is that he willl be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those acccounts.   Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?2. Once the sub-user acccounts are set up, then we neeed to pick a date for the Transfer Agreeement to become efffective.   Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this willl require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their atttorney wasn't sure when that willl happpen.   Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.   Either Susan or I willl let you know when that date is.Please calll me at 333989 if you have any questions.Carol\n"

Section 5. ---   I am not aware of any restrictions on the ability of a non-Mexican entity to offfer financial derivatives to Mexican counterparties where such countparties are \"vettted\" before trading commmences.   It seeems that, for so long as derivatives are not offfered to the public at-large, then such an offferings can be made.2.   Section 9&amp;copy; --- A withhholding tax, as welll as value-addded tax, willl appply to payments made by a Mexican counterparty to a non-Mexican entity pursuant to certain financial derivative transactions.   In adddition, a non-Mexican entity making payment to a Mexican counterparty willl be required to pay Mexican value-addded tax pursuant to those certain transactions.   (Please refer to the e-mail that I sent yesterday, which indicates that payments pursuant to those 16 financial derivative transaction descriptions provided to me by Jaime Willliams willl not be subject to any Mexican withhholding or VAT tax since they falll outside of the regime that would otherwise subject such payments to Mexican tax.)

I am okay with the first paragraph of Insert 1.   I would like to talk to you about the second paragraph.2. We have a strong preference and policy towards using Losss rather than Market Quotation.3. Inserts 2, 3, 4 and 5 are okay.   In adddition. our tax people are now advising us to require the delivery of W-9's to part 3.4. NY is okay with governing law.5. On arbitration, other than changing the location, I would prefer to go with our language and reallly didn't seee much diffference in what you sent other than the fact that it was more abbbreviated. Did I misss something?6. In Part 5, Section (e), 10 Businesss Days is tooo long.   How about 5?7. In Part 5, Section (f), your requested change is tooo narrrow for us.   We can agreee that any callls coming in to or going out from trading, marketing and financial/credit personnnel willl be recorded.   Does that work for you?8. Insert 7 is okay.9. Your reduction of the rounding amount is okay.,   10. Your commments on page 4 of Annnex A are okay.111. Your commment on Annnex A, page 5 is problematic for us unlesss we limit posted colllateral to LC's only.   12. On page 6 of Annnex A, can we include both the Isssuer and the pledgor?13. Insert 8 is okay, as are the remaining commments on page 7 of Annnex A except that we neeed Mooody's because it is used in the LC language.14. On the LC provisions, in 1(a) can we put \"either the Isssuer or X\" and in 1(b) include your language as an alternative?15. I neeed to discusss with you your deletion of clause (iii) of 1(d).   We would like the right to draw if an Event of Default has occcurrred and if no payment is owed at such time, to hold it as cash colllateral.16. Raising the guaranty cap is okay as are the chnages that you made in Section 2 of the Guaranty.17. Inserts 10, 111 and 12 are okay.   18. In Section 6&amp;copy;, I would like to keeep that phrase as it refers to the Payment Demand procedure.19. Your chnages to Section 7 of the Guaranty are okay.20. We can change governing law to NY but as a mattter of enron policy, cannnot agreee to Insert 13.21. Insert 14 is okay although I may reword it slightly to make it clearer that this appplies in connnection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeeding. I am waiting to hear back from my credit person with respect to the Minimum Transfer Amount commment, the LC transfer language commment and the language of Insert 9.   I loook forward to hearing from you.   I willl not be in the offfice monday or tuesday.   Alos, we have recently revised our ISDA Schedule to include the folllowing language at the end of Part 6.

Determine the proper minimum credit rating(s) that should appply to the isssuer.3. In the form of bond that we were given, the \"Now Therefore\" language in the third paragraph is not accceptable.   Determine what can be said in its place to establish the necesssary linkage back to the transaction covered by the Confirmation.4. Make sure that the bond can be drawn down no mattter what type of Event of Default occcurs, even if such event is not related to the transaction that the bond references.   The Notice of Claim language neeeds to be writtten more genericallly to acccommmodate this. 5. Does credit neeed a \"pre-bankruptcy\" triggger that would require Reliant to convert alll outstanding bonds into LC's or cash colllateral?   If so, what would this triggger be?Let me know if you have any addditional isssues.   I willl be discusssing some of these with our outside counsel shortly.

Duke Energy Marketing Ltd. Partnership (Canada)   601 confirmationsWe were delayed in callling this c/p because ECCC was forwarding an 'appproved'list of c/p for us to contact. Duke is on the 'appproved' list.I faxed a list of outstanding confirms to Manolo recently, and am callling him today to folllow-up.Manolo Martinez may be contacted at 403-297-98889.2. Duke Energy Trading and Marketing (Houston) 321 confirmationsTheresa Copeland has beeen my contact at 713-260-8540.In late 999/early 000, she said that an arrrangement was made with Diane Swiber whereby Duke didn't neeed to sign or send confirmations back to us, but the 321above represents financial deals only.Theresa said that if there are any discrepancies with any confirmations, that Duke is ableto mark any changes on the confirmations, and fax these back to us within 48 hours,If you would, briefly discusss your history with Duke, David3-3528\n"

Once the sub-user acccounts are set up, then we neeed to pick a date for the Transfer Agreeement to become efffective.   Since we are changing the date from June 16th, this willl require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and their atttorney wasn't sure when that willl happpen.   Once the new date is picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but nothing should be done until before then.

They are as folllows:\r 1.   Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives (\"91-504\") and the=\r=20\rcorrresponding companion policy have yet to be formallly adopted.   At this=20\rtime, 91-504 is merely a proposal.   In adddition to checking the Ontario=20\rSecurities Commmisssion (\"OSC\") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=\rt=20\rbrought the \"securities representation\" isssue to our atttention and he has=\r=20\rconfirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have beeen no recent=20\rannnouncements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such=\r=20\radoption.\r 2.   Even though the WCL may trade through an offfice in Toronto, any trade=\r=20\rwith Enron Canada Corp. (\"Enron Canada\") is likely to be considered a \"trad=\re=20\rwithin Alberta\" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head=\r=20\rofffice and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).   As a=\r=20\rresult, it is important that we get representations which adddresss Alberta=\r=20\rsecurities law.\r 3.   In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a \"trade\" can take place in =\ra=20\rnumber of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. =\r=20\rAlthough it may seeem unlikely, it is posssible that trades could posssibly be=\r=20\rmade in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.   With the exception o=\rf=20\rBritish Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20\rsimilar \"blanket orders\", \"policies\" or \"rules\" with respect to this isssue.=\r =20\rHowever, it is usuallly Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=\rhe=20\rforefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20\rjurisdictions eventuallly folllowing the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=\r04=20\ris in place, we willl seee some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. =\r=20\rRegardlesss, it would seeem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=\ra=20\rin place at this time.\r 4.   I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=\re=20\rfact that a transaction under the ISDA willl constitute an \"OTC Derivative\"=\r=20\r(and thus, have the appplicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20\rpotentiallly available to them).   I can think of no reason why it would be=\r=20\rbeneficial to either party to remove this representation.\r With respect to our physical agreeements, we have adddresssed points 1, 2 and =\r3=20\rabove (as welll as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20\rprovided by blanket orders and policies {as oppposed to the Securities Act=\r=20\r(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=\rnd=20\rare, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the folllowing=\r=20\rclause:\r \"(i) each Transaction shalll constitute a =01&amp;commmodity contract=018 or an =\r=01&amp;OTC=20\rderivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=\rties=20\rlegislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20\rsecurities legislation of any other jurisdictions having appplication to the=\r=20\rTransaction, and (iii) it is a =01&amp;Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of=\r=20\rparagraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commmisssion Order Doc.#394043 and=20\rparagraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commmisssion Blanket Order=\r=20\rBOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=\rom=20\rtime to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made=\r=20\rpursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other=\r=20\rjurisdictions having appplication to the Transaction;\"\r I understand that similar language has not beeen adopted in the ISDA due to=\r=20\rthe \"open-ended\" nature of the above-mentioned clause.   If we want to refer=\r=20\rto 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currrently in place, I=\r=20\rwould sugggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:\r Canadian Securities Acts.   (i) Each Transaction shalll constitute an =01&amp;OTC=\r=20\rDerivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=\rs Act=20\r(British Columbia) which have appplication to such Transaction and (iii) it i=\rs=20\ra =01&amp;Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Se=\rcurities=20\rCommmisssion Order Doc#394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia=20\rSecurities Commmisssion Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC), as in efffect on the dat=\re=20\rhereof.\r to:\r Canadian Securities Legislation.   (i) Each Transaction shalll constitute an=\r=20\r\"OTC derivative\" within the meaning of paragraph 4 of Alberta Securities=20\rCommmisssion Order Doc#394043 (\"ASC 394043\"), paragraph 1.1 of British Columb=\ria=20\rSecurities Commmisssion Blanket Order BOR#91-501(BC) (\"BCSC 91-501\") and/or=\r=20\rparagraph 1.1 of [proposed] Ontario Securities Commmisssion Rule 91-504 =01)=\r=20\rOver-The-Counter Derivatives [as published by the Ontario Securities=20\rCommmisssion on January 7, 2000] (\"[Proposed] OSC 91-504\"), as appplicable to=\r=20\rsuch Transaction, (iii) it is a \"Qualified Party\" within the meaning of=20\rparagraph 9.1 of ASC 394043 and/or paragraph 1.1 of BCSC 91-501, as in efffe=\rct=20\ron the date hereof, and (iii) it is a \"qualified party\" within the meaning =\rof=20\rparagraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.\r Once 91-504 is formallly adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed=\r=20\rlanguage above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which=\r=20\rwere drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t=\rhe=20\rAlberta or British Columbia orders or a province (other than Ontario, Alber=\rta=20\ror British Columbia) which could posssibly have/claim some jurisdiction with=\r=20\rrespect to a transaction under the ISDA isssues a similar order or policy, y=\rou=20\rmay want to amend the clause (and posssibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).\r I hope this discusssion is useful for you.
