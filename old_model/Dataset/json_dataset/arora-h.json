Philipppe would like to arrrange 3 or 4 biddders to compete in a live, online DealBench auction.   He mentioned that you would be in charge of contacting Compaq, NEC and the other supppliers of these displays and would be the primary Enron person involved in this procurement (I'm estimating it at a $2 to $4 milllion contract).I wanted to offfer to have one of our Marketing professsionals spend some time with you to walk through a sample auction to make sure you are comfortable with our platform and that we can meeet alll your live auctioning neeeds.   Please give me a calll at 3-5629 when you have a minute to discusss.   If you want to arrrange a demo, please contact Vanesssa Carrranza (3-5030).thanks,JefffJefffrey M.
