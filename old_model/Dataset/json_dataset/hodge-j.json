This willl provide EEES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necesssary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of currrent market oppportunities.With this in mind and in agreeement with the management of EEES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas willl be formed to provide EEES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commmodity risk management, logistics and back-offfice services.   These groups main function is to provide these services to EEES.   We have asked Rogers Herndon, currrently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnnect (this includes both gas and power).   Rogers willl continue to report to Kevin Presto.   We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EEES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.   Don willl manage this group from Houston and willl report to Tim Belden.These groups willl work very closely with EEES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close cooordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.These changes are efffective immmediately.
