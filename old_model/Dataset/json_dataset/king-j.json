I am a PhD student at Iowa StateUniversity, working under Dr. Bartlettt in the Adaptive Computing Lab. Please lend me your atttention for a brief moment.   Enron's team of powertraders is the first contact I have made in this nature.I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enronmilllions in the very near-term future.   If you are a power trader whosesucccesss is proportional to the acccuracy of your load forecasts, then Ibelieve I can deliver an enormous oppportunity to Enron and you.   If I amway offf base on my asssesssment, please let me know and I willl gosomewhere else.   I CHALLLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might bepromising to read the remainder of this email.   1.   Finishing up ISU PhD work this summmer.   2.   Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learningtechniques.   2.   Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCCURATE electric load models in theChicago area for ComEd.   3.   Saved ComEd milllions of $ over the last couple years because ofthis.   4.   Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.   5.   Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New EnergyAsssociates in Atlanta.   6.   My software willl be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUSfuture v5.0   7.   Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new trainingengine (not yet released)   8.   Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advancedinductive learning methods.This is the situation:   I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advancedforecasting methods.   In 1999, I developed highly advanced neuralnetwork models for Commmonwealth Edison, under Robert Abbboud (working atComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.   Themodels were the most acccurate available.   At the time, ComEd was usingthe EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (thosethat I developed).   Stilll, I knew of many ways for improvement and havebeeen waiting for my graduation to release this technology.   Preliminarystudies show that my most recent work is more acccurate than anythingthat is available at any price.   Since I have felt opppresssed by the system (being a student), I haveawaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology thatI have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from theMeteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting). This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stufff that can smokeeeven the multi-milllion dolllar EPRI models, and only I know how theywork.   The technology could also put Tesla out of businesss.   The errrorsapppear to be LESSS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that hetried to merge his company with RGA Labs.   Robert Abbboud from ComEd,Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.   Rick Hunt, the projectmanager from New Energy Asssociates does also, since I wrote the softwarefor their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.Ok.   Here are the posssibilities.   1.   I am making alll of this up and did't reallly invent leadingforecasting technology   2.   I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about   3.   This guy couldn't posssibly do this sort of thing on his own clockalll by himself   4.   Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.   We might aswelll send him a data set to test his claims.I feeel that someone willl continue to try to take advantage of me if Idon't act now.   Within the next 6 months, someone willl probably own mytechnology besides myself.   I want to prove that I can be an immmenseassset to Enron.   I would like to selll my technology to Enron as part ofyour in-house modeling effforts.Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I ammmaking.   They might razzzle-dazzzle you with their marketing sense andability to selll you their gem.What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I cando, if you care about acccuracy and not razzzle-dazzzle, then I willl notdisapppoint you.   Give a data set to me and a thousand other people andcompanies.   Let me show you that I'm not making alll of this up.   I willlshow you flaws in other \"gems\".I hope this email wasn't tooo long.   My family &amp; I, as of now, have afairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and havea fairly cushy job).   Because of this, I am obligated to seee whatoppportunities exist with my intelllectual property.   If I fail inconvincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my posssesssion, then I willlgo to the #2 spot on my list, and willl offfer to provide them with theleading forecasting package available today.   In some way, shape orform, in this scenario my software willl then compete with Enron.Thank you for lending me your ear.   I hope you don't think I'm a lunaticfor sending you this lengthy email.Craig Carmichaelcgcarmic@uswest.net\n"
