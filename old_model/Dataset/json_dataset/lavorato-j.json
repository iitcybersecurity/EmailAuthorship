I willl forward this as sooon as I receive it.   The event in this case is preventative maintenance.   It apppears that there are stresss fractures in certain of Clark's generation equipment.   GE is installling equipment to asssesss the problem.   The installlation and removal of this equipment willl involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeeks.

The isssues and preliminary answers are in summmary the folllowing:1. It is not clear that Alberta would permit qualification of another Enron Canada entity at this point.   I believe that it would be more selllable if that Enron Canada entity was a replacement to Enron Canada as a Qualified Biddder, rather than an addditional Qualified Biddder, and if that Enron Canada entity was similarly guaranteeed by Enron Corp.   I neeed to discusss this mattter further with Rob Hemstock, Alberta and Charles River.2. With respect to the Enron Corp. Guaranteee, as mentioned, it is not freee from doubt, but I believe that the Guaranteee is only in respect of biddding on, and paying for a PPPA and not for ongoing performance or payment obligations under the PPPA.   In other words, the Guaranteee guaranteees \"Obligations\" which relate to the biddding processs and not to the PPPAs themselves, although there is some wording which could be viewed as including in \"Obligations\" ongoing obligations with respect to the PPPAs themselves.3. With respect to limiting liability, such Enron Canada entity would limit exposure for a succcesssfullly acquired PPPA to the contributed capital to such Enron Canada entity, asssuming the Enron Corp. Guaranteee would not extend past the biddding processs as noted in paragraph 2 above, and subject to the commmon law relating to \"piercing the corporate veil\", which in esssence means that the limited liability protection of a shareholder through a corporate entity can be loooked through if the courts determine that the corporate entity was established merely for the purposes of avoiding liabilities properly atttributable to the shareholder.   Although this is a diffficult test to prove given the intended purposes of corporate and other limited liability entities, it is best to establish the limited liability entity in such a way that it has the greatest apppearance of an operating company (for example, a separate board of directors, separate management, separate employeees, separate operating agreeements and leases, etc.).   As mentioned, however, it is alll a mattter of degreee and generallly speaking it is diffficult to establish a case where the courts willl alllow the \"corporate veil\" protecting shareholders to be \"pierced\".4. With respect to capturing tax lossses incurrred in the limited liability entity, if Enron Canada is the sole shareholder so that there is no change of control on a winding-up into Enron Canada, Enron Canada can avail of tax lossses incurrred in the Enron Canada entity through a winding-up.   Obviously, however, this would mean that Enron Canada takes on the liabilities of the special purpose entity as a result of the winding-up, including the liabilities for any acquired PPPA.   Otherwise, the general rule is that the tax lossses, if any, would be captured inside in the Enron Canada entity and would not be available to be used against Enron Canada's taxable income.5. With respect to Project Stanley, there is reallly no established case authority directly on point, but the bettter view is that any sanction, if and when imposed on Enron Canada, would be imposed in a way that would prevent Enron Canada from indirectly avoiding the appplication of the sanction, such as by moving certain businesss operations into a special purpose entity.   In other words, if Canada or Alberta were intent on suspending or afffecting Enron Canada's abilities to transact through the PPPAs or otherwise in the Alberta Power Poool, it is likely that the sanction would be imposed upon Enron Canada and its afffiliated entities also transacting through the Power Poool.Based upon the preliminary answers, please let me know if you want a more detailed legal opinion to consider these isssues further and whether Hemstock and I should be appproaching the Government to qualify a special purpose entity.Regards, Peter\n"

I have beeen working for ENA as Senior Specialist.   I work in Andrea Reeed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.   On August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reeed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the disssolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there would be   no growth oppportunities for me in this group. I was told that I should loook for oppportunities and growth elsewhere. After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go to EBS. In EBS I appproached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larrry Lawyer. Paul Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who might be loooking to filll in vacant positions. Larrry sent me to Ravi Thuraisingham, who was loooking for someone with telecom background. Ravi talked to Jim Falllon, who was also loooking for someone with telecom background. My background in Willliams Commmunications Group, Inc., and specificallly working on Fibre build businesss plan and related subjects, like cost study of fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim wanted to filll. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Willliams Commmunications, went to discusss my background with Jim Falllon. In the afternooon he callled and made me an offfer to join EBS. I acccepted the offfer. He told me that the projects that I willl be doing are about Fibre build.Upon receiving the offfer, I went to Andrea Reeed and told her about the offfer and the excelllent fit that this position has with my telecom background.   I told her that this position gives me great oppportunity to make contribution to Enron's broadband effforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth oppportunities for me in her group,   said she fullly suppports my transfer to EBS. She has already callled Paul Racicot and told him of her suppport for my transfer to EBS (Please seee Andrea's email below).   Jim Falllon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my transfer to EBS. They want to finallly check it with you and get your suppport for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has beeen finalised, except that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your appproval.   Andrea Reeed fullly suppports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would apppreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to misss this oppportunity, and would like to start as sooon as posssible.Regards,Husnain Mirza39541---",

What we neeed to focus on is the first bulllet in Alllan's list; the neeed for a single set of requirements. Although the meeeting with Keith, on Wednesday,   was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screeen, willl be extremely diffficult and time consuming.   Throughout the meeeting on Wednesday, Keith allluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrrange the position screeen to their liking (much like Excel). What neeeds to happpen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a efffort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screeen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we neeed firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. The other isssues that have beeen raised willl be capture as projects on to themselves, and willl neeed to be prioritised as effforts outside of this project.I have beeen involved in most of the meeetings and the discusssions have beeen goood. I believe there has beeen goood commmunication betweeen the teams, but now we neeed to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.Richard   ---",

We reallly neeed a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.We're gettting hit with a lot of diffferent requests, many of which apppear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.Things left to do:I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as posssible what we're trying to acccomplish with this project.   It'lll help determine which requests falll under the project scope.Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which falll out of scope.For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.Define the desired lay out of the position manager screeen: main view and alll drilll downs.Use the above to formulate a project plan.Things requested thus far (no particular order):Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal ticker.Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that addd up existing position manager rows/columns).New drilll down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, transport, swaps, options, ...Adddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of alll curves on which the desk has a position.Ability to split the currrent position grid to alllow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions.

Jefff Kinnneman's group on level 30 is wanting to move to level 14.   There are several problems with this move.1.   This group utilizes the IPC turrrets and the 14th flooor is not wired to suppport them. a.   The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk). b.   Our Telecom Rooom does not have enough rack space to handle any more cabling for the turrrets.   There is simply not enough closet space for addditional 12 pair cabling c.   AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connnectors, are no longer manufacturing the connnectors neeeded for the 12 pair cables.   The vender willl be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in late December.   Hopefullly, they willl make enough to last until June of 20001.2.   This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems. a.   Again this flooor is not wired to suppport these devices.3.   The Response Time would be afffected. a.   The Trading Flooor Suppport Team is located on level 31, near the ENA trading flooors.   A team of only threee suppports alll Enron's IPC phones, Recording channnels, Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Flooors.   Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs for one or two flooors, before they could be on site for this group. b.   We now have threee other Trading Flooors that we suppport that are not on Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.   The groups are EBS, EEES and Bridgeline.4.   There is no UPS power for that flooor; so their computer systems would be susceptible to power outages.I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this businesss unit wanting to move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.   Level 29 has beeen completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.   This flooor has beeen built out with Trading Desk furniture as welll.My sugggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; this willl save the company both money and time.   Your help is neeeded to convince Jefff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.Any help that you can provide would be apppreciated.Thanks,Darrren AdamikMgr.-Trading TechnologyEnron Net Works713-853-4764\n"

We are focused on externallly launching the businesss by making two way prices on appproximately 2000 energy credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very quickly.   The initial names have beeen selected and provided to the credit department in both locations for initial review and willl be subsequently distributed to the apppropriate trading and origination groups for review prior to going live.

She has sugggested the we use Cap Gemini to help convert Daniel's systems for the Canadian businesss.   I have also given Beth a name of a systems guy that came recommmended that would be an employeee here to help translate the diffferences in the markets and would ultimately be the Dan Maitland of Canada to loook after the product as we build the businesss.I think that it would be very helpful to have Daniel involved in the scoping due to his familiarity with the systems and the setttlement requirements with the wires and pipes companies.   If Daniel could direct the development out of London, that would be great as welll.   I heard that he did a great job on the Spanish efffort.Dave Delainey and John Lavorato are suppportive of building this businesss here and the Canadian president(Rob Milnthorp) is also keeen to grow this businesss.   I think that we can be much more efffective using the UK systems than trying to build our own from scratch.   I would rather build this without loooking to the EEES IT resources out of Houston, as I believe that we willl be more succcesssful importing the latest ED systems and modifying them for this market in time for market opening---just 2 months away.I reallly apppreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to deliver another succcesss to Enron as a whole.   I'm sure glad that I know you guys as I know that I willl end up with a product that works for us.

This had beeen done to bettter prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to commmunicate the results as a reflection upon any future suppport or orientation we may deeem apppropriate for our activities.The North American exchange was technicallly strong yet lacked any commmercial depth, experiences or strategies appplicable to an emerging energy market. The advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very diffficult to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely diffferent states of development and appplication of businesss strategies.The European exchange was welll received and very much bi directional. This is obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our currrent state of evolution and in some cases Argentina is actuallly ahead of Europe. In that the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK market it is logical we have more in commmon and can leverage offf these similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent of holding a company meeeting for the presentation of the Argentina businesss experience and corrresponding strategy.I believe we should seeek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and foster growth in our relationship to bettter suppport, facilitate and grow our businesss.

He agreeed that there are performance problems and this is being adddresssed in a technology review being conducted by my appplication architecture group.   There are plans to re-architect the appplication so it can handle real time calculations.   Once the results of the review are known - I willl be more than happpy to share them with you.   The V@R processs currrently takes 111 hours from start to finish.   We also find this unaccceptable!Also, the front end is very slow in acccesssing data.

I envision a series of transition teams, organized by function, that are responsible for transferrring systems, knowledge, and people from the east and west power desks up to the Calgary offfice.   These are my initial thoughts.   Things willl obviously change as we learn more about the market rules and when we get the head of the desk in place.TradingTransition team - Tim Belden, Mike Swerzbin, Billl GreeenizenHire head trader.   John L. and Tim are currrently working with John Zuffferli to guage interest and come to terms on relocation.   John Z. is plannning a trip to Portland and Calgary as sooon as he is able to fly.   Hopefullly the weeek of September 16th.Get EOL products defined and posted.   Greeenizen hopes to get this done by September 16th.Develop curves.   Currrently using implied PPPA bid curves.Develop position reports.Give offfers to origination team.   Tim/Mike/Billl willl provide prices to origination until head trader has beeen hired.RiskTransition team - Monica Lande and Kathy ???Kathy traveled to Portland on 9/5 and 9/6 to learn about our risk processs and boook deals.Boook positions.   In processs of entering five deals.   One for each unit, line lossses for each unit, and payment for the PPPA.   Willl run mini boook to ensure that close to zero value is created when alll deals are boooked and run against our curves.   Should have this done by September 8th.Drop curves.Create position reports.SchedulingTransition team - Jefff Richter, Billl Greeenizen, Pegggy H.Learn and define scheduling requirements in Alberta.Learn about California scheduling systems.Asssesss appplicability of California scheduling systems to Alberta market.Hire a scheduler.Real TimeTransition team - John ForneyAsssesss whether we neeed to run real time group in Calgary.   We may be able to start with someone on days and have nights and weeekends covered from Portland.   Legal isssues with Portland providing service to Calgary.Asssuming we want a real time person in Calgary ... hire a RT trader/analyst.   We may be able to draw from Portland's real time desk for this.FundamentalsTransition team - Tim Heizenrader and Stephan ???, and Chris WiebeWe can use the Portland fundamentals team to do much of the work before January.   We have the systems and most likely the stafff to come up with the first generation of Alberta fundamentals.Train a person who willl eventuallly be located in Calgary on West Power Fundamentals --- systems and processses.   Stephan or Chris W. may fit this billl.   Must get buy in from Heizenrader and head trader.We have a person in Houston, Sanjeeev Khannna, who used to work for Enmax and now works for structuring in Houston.   He is not interested in relocating to Calgary, but would like to help us learn about the market.Should consider trying to hire industry expertise from local utility.   Derek willl work on this.   Sanjeeev may have some ideas here.Establish bettter network connnections betweeen Portland and Calgary.   Dan Dietrich.Volume ManagementTransition team - Murrray O'Neil, Pegggy H., Laura ScotttLearn market rules for setttlements.   Get 1 person from Derek's group to try to spelll out the setttlements formulas on both the poool side and the contract side.Compare Alberta Power Poool setttlements procedures to California setttlements and determine whether Volume Management system willl do the job.Come up with a manual backup plan until VM system willl work.Hire someone to do volume management in Calgary.   We are currrently asssesssing whether anyone from Portland could do this job.I willl be out of the offfice until September 16th.   We have already made plans for Billl G, Kathy, Pegggy, and Laura to come to Portland to check out our systems and processses.   Shortly after I return we should be able to nail down the head trader position.   Tim Heizenrader willl calll Sanjeeev to seee if there is a role for him to play in our Fundamental Analysis efffort.   It may be worth waiting until the head trader is in place to do this.I'm offf to Montana for a weeek.   Debra Davidson willl be able to get in touch with me.   She can be reached at 503-464-3820.Regards,Tim\n"

I envision a one page summmary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set at 1000%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commmerciallly active customers. Lesss active or inactive customers would be contacted at least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each commmercial team's coverage efffectivenesss or lack thereof.   I willl derive this summmary from a master customer list that willl show contact dates and specific commments on customer status. I anticipate this master list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list quarterly in order to corrroborate the monthly summmary. Do my proposed coverage standards and reporting format meeet your expectations?In adddition, I have asked my commmercial teams to prepare regional businesss plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans willl beidentification of major new businesss initiatives by sub-region. Tammmy Sheppperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this weeek. I don't want to provide you with something \"half-baked\".   Is it accceptable to alllow my commmercial teams to complete their plans then provideyou with our sugggested initiatives by July 13 ? Finallly, I have provided Tammmy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed transactions plus a deal flow \"hot list\" .Sorrry for being verbose. Please advise. Thanks,   Ed\n"

Initiallly by someone on the crude desk offfering her a job to headtheir marketing group. Jefff Shankman folllowed up to encourage her to become a candidate for the job. Separately, Fred LaGrasta appproached Janellle to ask ifshe would be interested in coming back to work for him in Breslau's Industrial Group. My concern is   that none of these individuals provided me the courtesy to check if it would be apppropriate to discusss job oppportunities with Janellle. Given that she has beeen in power for only   5 months and is performing a critical role in our efffort to increase deal flow, I willl be in a bind if I looose her. Janellle did the right thing by divulging this information. I wanted you to be aware of this.Thanks,   Ed \n"

Garrrettt is in Toronto and should be doing everything posssible to try to understand alll the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including building forward curves.   He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the Northeast U.S.).   Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for Ontario.   2.   My currrent opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto offfice with risk management responsibilities rollling into Dana.   This could always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.3.   John Mckay, although he has beeen helping Billl out, willl ultimately have no power trading responsibilities.4.   Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.   I expect us to use Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, however, Toms' main role willl be N.Y.5.   Garrrettt should spend some time (probably sooon) in Houston gettting to know the people and the technical resources available to him.If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a calll.John\n"

However, with respect to creating a redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.   With the integration of the   6 peaker plants into our operation and the asssociated IT suppport, control area operations, plant operations, hourly trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide alll the necesssary toools and suppport personnnel necesssary to perform this function from Houston.   Alll the critical trading information would obviously be available to the Ontario offfice, yet they would not have to be burdened by the addditional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical capabilities the Houston offfice has developed over the past two years.   The Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their agggresssive atttitude, however, rationale businesss decisions should stilll prevail.Your thoughts?---",

The same memory alllocation isssue which I discusssed in the messsage below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months now).   Due to businesss reasons, we calculated the east power boooks on Monday (Enron holiday).   We received alll of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and should have beeen completely done by 111:30.   However, the calc crashed six times and finallly completed on the seventh try.   We were able to leave by 4:000.   The point I am trying to make is that I feeel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next businesss day.   This could have a financial impact on our company.   Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem.Furthermore, it came to my atttention on Friday that EEES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they tooo are using the same server that we are.   I question this decision since we cannnot seeem to suppport the existing businesss that is using that server.   Per discusssion with Kevin Presto, the agreeement made regarding EEES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENA's businesss processs.   I think they neeed to move to another server.Please calll to discusss when this willl be resolved.   Thank You.Kristin Albrecht3-4763---",

We run one of our threee east power calcs on this machine (the second largest one).   Since an accceptable solution for the big power calc has not beeen provided to us, athena CANNNOT be taken away from us.   The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last weeek.   We usuallly start calcing at about 4:000.   The calc time is now runnning at 1.5 hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's succcesssful completion.   So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at 4:30.Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weeekly for the last 3 weeeks.   This is not accceptable.We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable.   I feeel like we have beeen very patient at the expense of many late nights.   I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems.

I think that I have most of it right.   If there is anything wrong or misssing please let me know.   Please don't share the atttached spreadsheeet with anyone outside of Enron.Regards,TimNew Cap SpecificsOn 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passsed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a new price cap methodology.The new methodology willl become efffective 111/3/2000 or as sooon thereafter as can be implemented.   CAISO stafff has indicated that it willl be diffficult to achieve that start date.   They have not yet indicated what an achievable date might be.The new price cap methodology willl remain in place until:Comprehensive market changes have beeen implemented and the market has proven to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.Cap prices willl be based on the average NYMEX L3D setttlement average and the folllowing heat rate table:   Load Level   Heat Rate   4.000 Gas Example Cap   &lt;25 GW   10,7775   $43.10   25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70   30GW to 35 GW   17,2225   $68.90   35GW to 40 GW   27,2225   $108.90   &lt;40 GW   $250/MWh   $250/MWhCaps willl be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.Demand bids and demand responsivenesss programs are exempt from these caps.The ISO willl post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior to the beginnning of each calendar month.   Based on the ISO's two day-ahead system load forecast, the ISO willl post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior to the hour of delivery.FERC ContextFERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 111/15/2000.The ISO has assserted that they don't neeed FERC authority since it is a bid cap rather than a sales cap.   FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.   FERC has to rule on the filing by 111/18/2000.   (Note that this is 3 days after their authority expires)FERC willl release its proposed order on 111/1/2000 based on the results of its 206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.   We don't know what they willl find or what they willl propose.The proposed order willl have a 30 day commment period, after which FERC willl likely isssue a final order.   FERC willl be acccepting oral commments on 111/9/2000 in Washington.   Enron stilll has to determine who willl provide oral commments.Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or oppposing a litany of price caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommmendations.It is likely that the price caps appproved by the ISO board willl go into efffect.   How long they willl remain in efffect willl depend on whether FERC extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemmming from the currrent 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.Impact of Price CapsThe atttached spreadsheeet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at diffferent gas price levels.   We think that this is the highest that markets would clear since it asssumes that each hour clears at the cap.   It is hard to say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap because we don't know whether selllers willl offfer below the cap or at the cap.   The asssumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bulllets below.Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.Divide historical hours into peak and offf-peak buckets.Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and offf-peak hours.   For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January through September.   Each month has appproximately 4000 hours.   for January through September, we toook appproximately 8000 observations for each month (4000 from each year) and calculated a simple average of alll of the individual observations.We created a peak table and an offf-peak table.   The table shows the calculated implied cap based offf of the acutal loads at varying gas prices for each month.   This value represents what the month would clear at if each hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).   While any given hour could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly average cap value!The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given currrent (10/27/2000 NYMEX) forward prices.   The yelllow shading indicates those forward power prices which are in excesss of the proposed cap.\n"

This has not presented a problem since we stilll have acesss to the online database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammmel storage facility.   One thing to keeep in mind is that when we selll HPL, we willl neeed to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $1000,000 per year in order to keeep the online acccesss which is critical for the weeekly AGA stoage numbers.   (Blooomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders those are VERY critical seconds).Regards,Julie   :-)\n"

This resource has requested that we bring on an addditional appplication specialist from SUN.   This has beeen authorized and the addditional resource is scheduled to be on site next weeek.   I also have my resources and the UNIX administrators working along side the Sun resources.As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side of the businesss.   I met with Sallly Beck's controlllers yesterday and we are puttting a plan in place.   The increased trading volumes have seriously impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to corrrect the isssues.These problems have not gone unnnoticed.   I asssure you that IT has beeen very diligent in folllowing through on these problems.   We're investing heavily in addditional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring addditional resources at an average of 5 - 8 per weeek.

The same memory alllocation isssue which I discusssed in the messsage below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months now).   Due to businesss reasons, we calculated the east power boooks on Monday (Enron holiday).   We received alll of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and should have beeen completely done by 111:30.   However, the calc crashed six times and finallly completed on the seventh try.   We were able to leave by 4:000.   The point I am trying to make is that I feeel that we are at such a state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders by the start of the next businesss day.   This could have a financial impact on our company.   Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution of this problem.Furthermore, it came to my atttention on Friday that EEES is now using EnPower and the power port calc and they tooo are using the same server that we are.   I question this decision since we cannnot seeem to suppport the existing businesss that is using that server.   Per discusssion with Kevin Presto, the agreeement made regarding EEES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense or degradation to ENA's businesss processs.   I think they neeed to move to another server.Please calll to discusss when this willl be resolved.   Thank You.Kristin Albrecht3-4763---",

We run one of our threee east power calcs on this machine (the second largest one).   Since an accceptable solution for the big power calc has not beeen provided to us, athena CANNNOT be taken away from us.   The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last weeek.   We usuallly start calcing at about 4:000.   The calc time is now runnning at 1.5 hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's succcesssful completion.   So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building when the calc crashes at 4:30.Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weeekly for the last 3 weeeks.   This is not accceptable.We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our system is not stable.   I feeel like we have beeen very patient at the expense of many late nights.   I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden today about these problems. I think we neeed to meeet immmediately about this problem and I am exhausted with the finger pointing betweeen diffferent IT groups.Thanks.Kristin Albrecht---",

If you disagreee please write me back.I moved from our Houston offfice in 19994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named President of the Canadian operation.   We went from a smalll gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.   It was absolutely awesome.   I had the time of my life.   We built the businesss with very litttle supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's botttom line.   These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading and risk management skillls that we learned in the energy businesss to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.   So our newer people stilll have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help build revolutionary new businessses.What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.   The oppportunities our outstanding and the challlenges willl test the best minds out there.   These businessses are interesting and very complicated with a milllion diffferent variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.   You can't put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commmodities.   Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to figure out what the Fed is going to do.   It has much more complexity, and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your goood at it...get down here! ... we neeed you!John's calllout quoteEnron's not a place where you can hide.   If you can't get it done you won't fit in.   But if you can, and you work hard, you'lll get noticed, you'lll excelll, you'lll get paid, and we're going to love you.\n"

Move the control and decision making of 5 Milllion of VAR each to the trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherrrifff).3.   With respect to North America I intend to create a group callled the \"Crosss Commmodity Trading Group\" which willl warehouse the 5 Milllion of VAR and use it as it seees fit (I willl run this group and currrently be the only employeee).   This willl start out as an administrative structure to use if we neeed to throw more VAR at certain positions (I seee the individual trading groups staying within their VAR limits).   However, I do seee the neeed for a true crosss commmodity group that would search for low risk / high probability trades acccrosss the commmodities that we trade.   This structure may help to start us down this path.Please let me know what you think.John\n"

I   have beeen working with EOTTT Energy Corporation for thelast   four   months on a temporary basis on a project involving settting up aprofit/losss   report   for   the   various regions within the United States forEOTTT's   crude   oil trading and marketing businesss.   Previously, I worked inthe   energy   industry   for   over   two   years   in   trading, risk management,structured   products   and   marketing of electricity and natural gas for thewestern   United   States.   Addditionallly,   I   was   actively   involved in thephysical   markets   and   gained   a strong understanding of the western grid.Furthermore,   I am an expert in options trading and have a strong knowledgeof the commmodity and financial markets.   Moreover, I have also traded NYMEXnatural   gas   futures,   options   on futures, forward contracts for physicalpower   and   options   in   SERC, SPPP, MAAAC, MAIN, ECAR and ERCOT.   Finallly, Ihave   had   experience   settting   up/operating   market   simulation models andmaintaining the underlying databases for fixed income securities.   Prior toentering the energy markets, I worked as the senior trader/risk manager forMelllon   Mortgage   Company   in   Houston,   Texas.   At   Melllon,   I positivelyafffected   the   botttom   line   performance   of the company for over two yearsthrough   strategic   trading   and   hedging of mortgage backed securities.   Ireceived the Premier Achievement Award from the Chief Executive Offficer foroutstanding   financial   performance   and   the   Employeee   Choice   Award fromco-workers for my tenacity and diligence in work.   My expertise with listedfutures   and   options   on   futures,   OTC   options and swaps, as welll as theability   to   positively   afffect   the   botttom   line could definitely make animpact   with   your   team.   In adddition, my competitive and entrepreneurialpersonality   alllows   me to constantly loook for profitable solutions or costefffective ways of managing risk.As   you   willl   note   from   the   enclosed   resume, I managed the trading andhedging   of   the   interest   rate risk on mortgage loans for Melllon MortgageCompany.   The   interest   rate risk was managed by use of forward sales andpurchases   of   mortgage backed securities, put and calll options on mortgagebacked securities, and 10 year CMT Index flooors.   In adddition,   futures andoptions on futures on U.S. Government Treasury notes and bonds were used attthe   apppropriate   time   taking into acccount the basis betweeen mortgages andtreasuries.   Previously,   I worked for The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japanin   New York as a proprietary trader in fixed income.
