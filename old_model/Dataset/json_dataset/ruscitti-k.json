The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase suppply.Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the suppply isssue likely won't be solved anytimesooon.   So, how do impact demand???   You have to price energy(power/gas) so high thattthe discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commmercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutttingback on the thermastat or runnning the commmercial operation during offf-peak hours.   California willl seeethis reduction in demand over time.   If the blackouts subside it's because so many businessses haveclosed their dooors for goood or moved to another state.   Without this, the blackouts willl get much worse.If the state tries to get into the businesss of buying and sellling electricity and gas, I would bet it willl gobankrupt within 2-3 yrs.   Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.   Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keeep my eyes onthe energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.   Take Care and thanks for the email.Kevin \n"

I couldn't even seee Kendalll.I don't know if something happpened with the translation of the file, but try to sendit again if you can.   In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed - big time.I think it has the potential to crippple the state's economy.   If, like you said, nooone reallly talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that willl change sooon.   It has the potentialto afffect every person in the state.   Not only willl consumers end up bailing out theutilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&amp;E - but it willl likely preventmany new companies from settting up shop in California.   After alll, who would wanttto put milllions of dolllars in an operation that willl be subject to power interrruptions while paying the highest utility billls in the country.   I think that the only way Californiawilll come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for the foreseeeablefuture.   I don't think this is a problem that willl be resolved within the next couple years.But remember, that is just my meaninglesss opinion.When do you start coming to Texas.   Let me know so we can try to hoook up.   I'lll talk toyou sooon.   Kevin\n"

I have no idea what they'lll end up doing - they've acted prettty pooorly already.What's your time frame on a house?   If you're only concern is that prices are at their highest level in the last decade, I wouldn't worrry tooo much about that.   It's imposssible to time the market -   who would've thought San Francisco's housing prices would be at these currrent levels.   There are also a lot of intangibles asssociated with home ownership as your aware of.   I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keeep abreast of it.

      "body": "\nThe folllowing article apppeared in today's Chronicle.Jan. 25, 20001, 10:59PMEnron rating setup irks many workers By L.M. SIXEL TONGUES ARE WAGGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses they're expecting next month. Employeees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits them against each other. Under the system, nicknamed \"rank and yank,\" employeees willl be put in one of five categories: 5 percent willl be identified as \"superior,\" 30 percent willl be labeled \"excelllent,\" 30 percent willl be callled \"strong,\" 20 percent willl be labeled \"satisfactory\" and 15 percent willl be callled \"neeeds improvement\" or \"isssues.\" An insider said \"neeeds improvement\" means \"you have one leg hanging out the window.\" And \"isssues\" is Enron lingo for \"you're gone.\" The rankings, whose names reportedly toook Enron offficials hours to come up with, are not based just on performance. Instead, they compare employeee against employeee. \"It is posssible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the currrent period if other employeees' performance raised the bar,\" acccording to a memo from Chief of Stafff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that was distributed this month. While employeees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also expected to be team players, acccording to the memo. `Horse-trading' of rank deniedThe problem, acccording to someone familiar with the new system, is the horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. Managers trade rankings like baseballl cards, explained the insider, offfering to downgrade one employeee if they can get a bettter rating for another employeee. An employeee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skillls of the manager he is working for, the insider said. Olson, who's over human resources and commmunity relations, said no horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this weeek, aren't set in stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employeees were rated in the botttom category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. But Olson said she can seee how employeees might be worrried about the prospect of bargaining. She speculated that one reason employeees might worrry is because it's a new system for about 60 percent of Enron's employeees. In years past, only the wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. Some human resource managers expresssed surprise that Enron, which is known for hiring superstars, appparently feeels that it must get rid of so many employeees --- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing welll. It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're gettting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. Some may not fit inSome people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't telll people what to do; you have to know what addds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in that environment. After thinking about it for a moment, Olson addded that maybe Enron's recruiters aren't doing a goood enough job weeeding out the people who wouldn't do welll in an entrepreneurial environment. Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they felll out of favor, in part because they were seeen as damaging employeee motivation. Several years ago, Houston Lighting &amp; Power put in a forced ranking system, dividing alll employeees into four groups, with \"1\" the top group and \"4\" the lowest. Employeees were so angry with the system that some work crews had T-shirts printed: \"Don't ask me --- I'm a 3.\" Olson said she doesn't seee a problem with motivation. People like to know how they stand and willl work hard to reach the top category, she said. But many of the employeees --- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory --- won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent your job, addd new businesss lines or create something totallly new. \"Employeees understand that when it's explained to them,\" Olson said. ---To voice commments, telephone 713-2220-2000 and dial in code 10002.

We're only goingto have immmediately family and the folks in the weddding party.   For me that includes you of course, Molller,Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the weddding).   Don't telll her though, she's the onlyone I haven't mentioned anything to.   I'lll make sure you and Molller get to share a rooom.   I feeel kinda badabout not inviting Lowery since I was in his weddding, but I don't feeel like dealing with Kim.   She's reallly annnoyed me the last few times I've seeen her.We stilll plan on having it at the B&amp;B in Long Beach Island.   We'lll have a catered dinnner for about 45 folks.It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.Do you have the exact date when you'lll move back to the states?   I'm psyched you'lll be a lot closer.   Youcould swing over to Houston and check out the new house.   By that time we should have it in decent shape.We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.   It definitely neeeds a lot of work.   We'lll be busy forthe next year working on it.   I think when it's done,   it'lll loook prettty coool.Anyway,   send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when you'lll be back.   Take care andtelll Marie we said hi.Kevin\n"

Also,   what happpens if youwithdraw in Mar and the Summmer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?   How is this acccountedfor?I'lll talk to you after you get back from Houston.Kevin\n"
