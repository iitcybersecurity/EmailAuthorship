We have received FERC's notice of the appplication (Docket No. CP01-69), and willl be filing an intervention before the February 20 deadline.   Southern Company Services has contracted for the fulll 7000,000 Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.   The project callls for about 59 miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compresssor station at a cost of about $94,343,7000.As part of its appplication, Petal also submittted pro forma tarifff provisions and rates for firm and interrruptible transportation services and asked for authority to charge negotiated rates.   Petal also requested appproval of certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreeement for the contract with Southern, appparently to alllow Southern to act as agent for its afffiliated operating electric utilities to appportion capacity among them.Please advise if you have any isssues with Petal that should be made a part of our intervention.   The certificate appplication is 635 pages, not including another 7778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request a copy unlesss someone indicates a desire to review it.\n"

Along with upgrading the O/S, Enron has also toook the initiative to move over to Microsoft Outloook2000, for our messsaging client.   This willl provide more flexibility and ease-of-use for e-mail, calendars, contacts --- not to mention an easier medium to synchronize data to your handheld devices. I would like to start the migration processs first with visiting with each of you, going thru a 'profile processs' that should last no more than 10-15min.   Profiling can begin as early as tomorrrow (4/17/01) - so here is what I ask of you: *** Please reply to this e-mail with a date/time that I can stop by.   Being that most of you sit in the same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling processs should take no more than a few days. *** Feeel freee to e-mail/calll me should you have any questions or any specific concerns with this processs, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT to Win2K is a smoooth, effficient one.Thank you,Kaceee DowneyDeployment Managerx555641281-541-9272 celll\n"
