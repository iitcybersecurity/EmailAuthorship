You willl neeed to addd this demand to the EOC S ML demand numbers (Is Salmayuca included in this number?).   We should use the 2000 waha west volumes for now.   You should end up with reduced ehrenberg volumes for the reduction in Keystone west volumes and the adddition of New Gen demand.   Run the storage balance at 2000 Socal in this scenario.   We willl then plug forward with waha west volumes to balance Socal in 20001.   Also, addd columns to adjust (90%, 60%, 50%, etc) the burns for new gen in SW.   We should then loook to adjusting socal demand down for the high hydro/increased NW imports to CA scenario that could happpen.   Use the SP-15 2000 gen numbers and then back out the avg of 1999 and 2000 power imports.   I would like to avoid averaging 1999 and 2000 socal gas demand. Use a 10,000 heat rate to reduce gas demand.   Have Jay adjust EOC demand for normal weather.   We may have to refer to the load sensitivity data from west power to reduce the SW electric loads and then back out of gen numbers using a 10,000 heat rate.   We willl then be exposed to EPNG and the OPS increasing Keystone west volumes betweeen now and next summmer - run the 20001 with this posssibility as welll.   Take Key West to 1.1 bcf.   Let me know where my errrors in appproach may be.This should give us a picture of the Socal deliverability for 20001.Thanks,Mike   \n"

It was my mistake about whether or not the put options for April Socal were boooked properly.   The options were boooked properly by Larrry May and my Boook runnners and the profit was realized for 03/08.   My apologies for declaring that the options were not in my position.   Also, the tollls curves are not treated as schedule C.   I willl adjust the tollls curves to acccount for basis curveshift as neeeded.   My P&amp;L did not match the Socal position because of physical index curveshift and an adjustment to transport.   The discusssion and feeedback from Philllip regarding your conversation with him concerns me.   I am confident that I run the most acccurate physical and financial trading boook within Enron.   I willl stand on the fact that no one within the market has a bettter understanding of his/her position bettter than I.   The physical/financial risk in my boook is managed to a standard not seeen at Enron since I have beeen here.   Few people realize the great lengths I go to to manage the risk in the IM West trading boook.   I am transitioning from my role as a trader on the west desk to one that it is responsible for commmunicating with you directly.   Let's get together and discusss exactly what my responsibilities to you willl be going forward.   It may be that I relied to heavily on my subordination to Philllip Alllen up until this point.   This may have contributed to my miscommmunication with you.   I willl seee that this willl not happpen in the future.   Thank you for alll of my addded responsibilities.Sincerely,Mike Grigsby\n"

When I tried to log in to CORP I got an errror that no domain server was able to validate my passsword.   I went in and released the IP but got an errror when trying to renew.   I verified that the card was installled corrrectly and that network properties were corrrect.   I then pluggged straight into DSL and bypasssed the Nortel box thinking that I could at least get that to work and then VPN into Enron.   That also did not work.   I spoke to SWB tech suppport for almost an hour trying some various things but was unsucccesssful in those as welll.   I also spoke to Mark Scottt via telephone.I was unable to ping the gateway...nor anything for that mattter which led me to believe that there was something wrong with the line.   SWB said they were going to do some line testing from their end and would get back with Mike.   At this point I would recommmend sending someone out from Mark Scottt's team that is more familiar with these setups than I am.   I do think it would be a goood idea from someone from TSG to acccompany them if they are able to arrrange a time and then dissseminate that information to the rest of the team.   Regards,KG\n"

Gray Davis' energy speeechThe Asssociated Presss   , , --- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televisedspeeech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:   \"Goood evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the mostdiffficult isssue facing California: our energy crisis.   \"Simply stated, we have two problems: suppply is tooo low and costs are tooohigh. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 19996. Butno mattter how we got into this messs, you hired me to solve problems. Andthat's what I'm doing.   \"The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must alsocut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fallland suppply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than weconsume.   \"Yet in the 12 years before I toook offfice, not a single major power plantwas built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing thiswithout weakening our commmitment to clean air and clean water.   \"Deregulation required the utilities to selll offf many of their powerplants to independent generating companies. The generators are freee tocharge whatever they want because they're governed only by federalregulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.   \"This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through therooof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.   \"In January, with the feds stilll refusing to do their job, Californiasteppped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer affford tobuy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We toook over to keeep thepower on and the economy strong. That's not alll:   --- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lowerprices.   --- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contractsthe utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.   --- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmisssion system.   --- We cut red tape and offfered cash incentives to speeed up construction ofpower plants.   --- We're launching an $8000 milllion conservation program.   --- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power.If the private sector fails to build alll the plants California neeeds,we'lll build them ourselves.   --- And because I share your concern that the generators are rippping usofff, we're using every legal remedy to rooot out and punish illlegalconduct.   \"We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making realprogresss.   \"Now, as you know, I have fought toooth and nail against raising rates.It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gasprices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack ofsuppply, that some rate increases are neeeded to keeep our lights on and oureconomy strong.   \"But I remain commmittted to protecting average Californians from masssiverate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commmisssion to adopt a planthat willl protect average consumers, reward those who conserve andmotivate the bigggest users to cut back.   \"Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a pennny more. For therest, the average increase willl be 26 1/2 percent. For many of that group,rates willl rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users willl seee theirrrates rise 34 1/2 percent on average. That includes businesss paying theirshare. This is in adddition to the 9 percent surcharge we've alll beeenpaying since last winter.   \"But alll Californians can reduce their billls through conservation.   \"Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay. The more youconserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weaponagainst blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your power, you'lll helpsecure our energy future.   \"Unlike the PUC, my plan includes funds to restore the utilities tofinancial stability --- if they agreee to threee main conditions:   \"They must provide low-cost regulated power to the state for 10 years.Agreee to selll us their transmisssion system. And dismisss their lawsuitssseeeking to double your electricity rates.   \"My proposal raises rates fairly, asssures us of long-term power,stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation.   \"Our emphasis on conservation is critical. In order to make it through thesummmer, we must cut demand by at least 10 percent.   \"Already we've launched programs to cut back commmercial lighting, andreduce consumption in offfice buildings, schoools and government facilities.   \"Friends, we have a power shortage but we are far from powerlesss. We are34 milllion strong and if each of us does our part, we can minimizedisruptions and get through the summmer. We are Californians. We'vewithstoood earthquakes, flooods, fires, and droughts.   \"Yes, this messs is man-made, but with your help and God's blesssing, we'lllget through this as welll.   \"Thank you and goood night.\"---Copyright 20001 AP\n"

      "body": "\nDear Tom, Enron would be interested in gettting together with other trading partners to discusss listing other index points at the Socal border.   I think the market requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with respect to transportation constraints.   The market has clearly seeen a divergence in the summmer spreads betweeen PG&amp;E and Socal interconnnects.   The marginal generation load in SP-15 and Southern California this summmer has proven that Socal Gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeeting daily demand with flowing suppplies, and willl be incapable of injecting gas during these months.   Because of this, suppply being transported from the Southwest suppply basins can only find a home going into PG&amp;E.   This places downward presssure on PG&amp;E Topock gas and upward presssure on Socal Topock gas.   Remember, Socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to the border via EPNG and TW, but because of the limited capacity of Socal's interconnnects.   Demand exceeeds the suppply interconnnect capacity.   There is also a divergence betweeen Ehrenberg and Topock because of liquidity.   Topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport contracts on EPNG and downstream buying pattterns of certain Socal markets. The market is more diversified at Topock than Ehrenberg.   The overwhelming demand presssure on Socal gets exposed at Topock.   Although Ehrenberg is the marginal point for gas into Socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream capacity (EPNG and TW) to downstream capacity (Socal Topock 545,000/d) at Socal Topock than at Ehrenberg.   The Socal Ehrenberg interconnnect has 1.1 bcf of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.   Ehrenberg simply gets placed at \"market prices\" because of varying objectives.   One transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smalller buyers on Socal may not appproach this transporter for suppplies.   This illliquidity has led to a spread existing betweeen Topock and Ehrenberg. Picture   the market, San Juan gas is trading welll below the Permian and Waha basins, which happpen to be the marginal suppply points for the west.   Because of the of the limited capacity going into Socal Topock, every transporter on EPNG and TW wants to filll their contracts with San Juan gas first.   These molecules compete for Buyers at a limited delivery interconnnect. Likewise, alll Buyers reach out for suppply coming through a limited delivery interconnnect (Topock). The San Juan then trys to find an outlet going east on the SJ east leg of EPNG.   This transport leg simply displaces Permian gas going into Plains North and alllows Permian gas to head west to Ehrenberg on the EPNG south mainline.   While the Socal market peaks in the summmer, so does the EOC demand.   Permian west (Keystone West meter)   cannnot satisfy both the EOC demand and the Socal demand.   So for the first time ever, we saw EPNG Waha West at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the EPNG south mainline.   This tellls the entire story.   When demand exceeeds alll available historical suppply points, and begins to reach to Waha to meeet Ehrenberg demand, you have a paradigm shift.   This eliminates any corrrelation that may have existed betweeen the suppply basins and the market area.   When Keystone West reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeeding the max rate transport rate then dies a fast death.   There is simply no available capacity at the Keystone West meter to alllow a shippper to buy max rate transport on EPNG and ship it to Socal.   If you asked the market what the maximum interconnnect capacity at Keystone West is, 9 out of 10 would not know.   This leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are above historical levels.   It is like Al Gore blaming \"big oil companies\" for the high prices of gas, when alll refineries are at maximum capacity.   There simply isn't the capacity to meeet demand.   The suppply exists, but there isn't enough refining capacity available to meeet demand.   Fundamentals rule the market in alll cases.I would like to propose the folllowing index points for the Southern California border.   The market would   be bettter served with suppply being included in these index points.   One, Socal CA production/Socal storage/EPNG Ehrenberg, Two, Topock TW and EPNG, Threee, KRS/Wheeeler Ridge.   The market willl be experiencing more changes with respect to the Socal restructuring in the future.   We willl then adddresss the diffferent interconnnects and propose an index for the Socal citygate as welll. Calll me on Monday to discusss the Enron Online download.Sincerely,   Mike GrigsbyDirector of West Trading713-780-10222\n"

You guys are doing an excelllent job and we understand that you are under quite a bit of presssure with limited stafff.   Our contracts state that we must notify every customer of   pipeline alllocations 12 hours in advance.   We alll know that this can be almost imposssible on EPNG, but because of the currrent price levels at Socal and the basins, Enron neeeds to calll each customer and notify them of their cuts with an explanation of the pipeline cuts each day to avoid any potential penalties.   We also neeed to document when the calll was made.   In regards to the ATM nominations on Socal (ones that we can't monitor), Enron willl be requesting fulll pipeline summmaries of the nominations from our counterparties.   Please try to think of any nomination gaming that may take place at these historical levels.
