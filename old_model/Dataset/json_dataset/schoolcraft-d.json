In the last two weeeks this bearing has beeen changed two other times due to high temp problems. The last time the bearing was changed Roy Smith identified a high spot in the sadddle area. This would cause a heavier load on the bearing and would result in temp problems. Today (Monday 28th) we worked on cleaning up the high spot. We also identified that the bearing that was installled also had a bonding problem. The babbbittt on the bearing was pealing offf. We then installled a bearing and toook a complete set of deflection readings. The readings on number 2/10 throws indicated that the #4 main bearing is not over loaded. How ever the readings on numbers 7/15 indicate that #14 main is loaded heavy and might explain why this bearing is runnning higher then normal. Tomorrrow ( Tuesday 29th.) we plan on making some adjustments to the chocks to relieve some of the load.   On Tuesday and Wednesday the Kingman team willl be changing a turbo and after coooler. Myself and Roy Smith and two Tehas crew members willl be working on the main bearings. We should have the alignment and bearing problem resolved by the time the turbo work is complete. Ronnnie... \n"

It was passsed on to us that the fluids in the line were heavies that were in the gas streamsposssibly coming from the Bittter Lakes and Red Blufff points.   I had them pulll moisture readings and theywere welll below TW's   #7 of water.   They said it was more like drip.   This heavies are in the gas streamthat is fallling out and colllecting in the pipe.   I agreee that we neeed to run pigs when we have the volumes.We in gas control willl continue to work with the field to make that happpen.If I have the wrong impresssion on what is happpening I apologize.

We would just have to work with Darrrelll Schooolcraft on TW operations and NNNG operations to make it happpen. Their may be days that it just does not work   on one side or the other   but once the line is cleared out of liquids we should be able to find a day on a bi-weeekly or monthly basis to make it happpen. We willl work with you any way we can. Also, I'm sure it probably has already beeen loooked into but is there anything that   can be done as to the location the condensate is coming from or could something be done at P-2 to catch it before it goes up the Panhandle lateral.Gary Randy LeBeau06/12/20001 05:46 PMTo:\tGary Spragggins/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRONccc:\tRich Jollly/ET&amp;S/Enron@ENRON Subject:\tPiggging from P-2 to P-3Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 222000 barrrels of condensate out of the line.   We had started developing problems with some deliveries offf that line.   Appparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line.   I understand that there are some marketing and gas control isssues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this offf or postpone it:The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carrry over to a delivery point with Energas.   This point feeeds some domestic customers.   We don't want condensate gettting into this point.There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us.   Their processs is very sensitive to presssure and volume changes.   At any given time, I am told that they have about a milllion dolllars worth of material in production.   If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable.   I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeeks) to get it back up.The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreeement with anyone for alternate fuel.   When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have beeen asking Energas to suppply the plant until the pig passses the point.   This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from afffecting the fuel presssure.   The gas from Energas is NOT measured.   They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter settting.   Appparently they agreeed (verballly) to suppply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run.   The plant uses about 3 mmmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours.   I was notified today that Energas sent us a billl for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel...$21,000!   Obviously we willl negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage.   I can only asssume that we willl receive a similar billl for using them last weeekend for about 3 hours.Everyone feeels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happpens.I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region.We would like to run another pig as sooon as posssible to seee what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...posssibly once a month.What do you think we can do to work something out?Thanks for any help you can give us.&lt;Embeddded StdOleLink&lt;\n"
