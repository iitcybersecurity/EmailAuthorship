This represents the price diffference betweeen what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us out of the terminal feee or let it appply to a future delivery, that would addd an addditional $1 MMM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that addds another $4.7 MMM.A second Hoegh Gallleon cargo should addd $1.5 MMM but would neeed to be sourced from Nigeria or Algeria(???). Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 20001. It can be November 23-December 15 (unlesss another date is mutuallly agreeeable). The date of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to receive the Hoegh Gallleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh Gallleon should therefore be betweeen December 20 and January 111 - depends on Cabot. Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Gallleon cargo as sooon as 29 days after the first Hoegh Gallleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two Hoegh Gallleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (1000 days after the Last Cargo of 20001). In adddition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.Economics and Timing -   The amount of value to be captured is most heavily influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Gallleon cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal balll, we would lock-in the economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the NYMEX botttoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.000/MMMBtu in the last 2 weeeks. Where willl it go from here?In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we neeed to get Eco on board and initiate discusssions with a producer about suppply for the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Masssey to confirm that the contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are trying to do.I would apppreciate any insights that you may have regarding this oppportunity.Regards,Paul\n"
