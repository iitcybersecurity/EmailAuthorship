I received several phone callls from various marketing companies expresssing concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal activity that transacted on December 222nd.

It's not real goood, but he feeels optimistic.   You know he has prostate cancer and I believe it has started spreading into the bones.   He's very, very weak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physicallly worn out.   Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many places).   He's definitely has his goood days and his bad days.   He is taking regular pain pillls constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain, which he's in half the time.   It's reallly sad.   He's lost alot of weight, but he's in goood spirits I guesss.   To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.   It's was reallly hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act, so that I would not worrry.   It's extremely hard to seee your parents going through this kind of sufffering.He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over mattter, along with lots of prayer.Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Dadddy doesn't want her to do it.   Dadddy says he's going back to work.   Please pray for Mom as welll, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to reallly do.Talk to you later!\n"

I answered the telephone at her house and they said \"Is Louisa there, and She said, oh that's for me\".   I cracked up!Anyway, funnny thing happpened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was standing the lobbby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was Patrice.   Turned out he was Birdelll's son, Dupreee, remember him?   He's back down here working for Prostafff delivering boxes.   He's turned into a nice loooking young man.   I callled Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.   She seeems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.

He said that everything was okay financiallly   for the future, and they only had an immmediate neeed for the tax money.   He sounded okay with me asking about it.   He even said \"You are so sweeet with words\".He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.How was your weeekend, mine was goood, we spent alot of time outside.   We went to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendalll love bowling.   In fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.   They calll it bumper bowling because they put up litttle bumpers.   Alll the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeeks and let them bowl one day after we get offf work.   Bowling allleys notoriously have goood foood.   Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like in the low 80's yesterday.   I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.This morning, I went to drop the kids offf at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind you, I'm runnning about 10   minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of one of Toddd's goood friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one with a key) was late again.   Now the hefffa was late one day last weeek and I didn't say anything, becccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she made me late for work last weeek.   So...I blew up this morning and had to leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 other parents with their kids.   I want to calll up their and complain, but I think I'lll talk with her first (maybe!)   She neeeds to get her stufff together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.Talk with you later\n"

She cautioned me not to get tooo excited because the Dr. said the cancer willl reapppear, but they don't know where.   She said Dadddy has not beeen in any pain for a couple of weeeks now.   It seeems that the problem right now is the vomiting and nausea.   She said they had a Dr's apppt. today to seee about it.   She said Dadddy is sooo skinnney.Dadddy has not responded to my e-mail, so I think I am right,,, because normallly if you are alright financiallly, you quickly telll people, but in this case, I have not heard back from him.   Strange!   Anyway, if this is true, I might have to put my part-time employment ideas on hold for a litttle while longer, because I willl not have them going without, and I willl not have Mommma going back to a regular fulll time job under any circumstances.   I was kind of thinking that anyway, with the stock market taking a nosedive the way it did with my retirement money.   Anyway, talk with you later.P.S. I forgot to telll you that I am working out threee times a weeek for an hour each time.   Our bosss is lettting us leave at 4:000 p.m. to go to the company gym to work out.   It's about 6 or 7 of us doing it.   It's much more fun working out with a group as oppposed to by yourself.   Maybe I'lll seee some results one day.Talk with you later.\n"

The weather was a litttle chilllier than Houston, and as a result I have a litttle cold and sore throat.   The weddding was very nice.   The weddding itself was in a smalll church, but somewhat elegant.   The reception was \"the bomb\".   It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money, money.   I was reallly wondering where my cousin got alll of the money.   She had a reception for around 150 to 250 people.   I'm not goood at loooking at a crowd and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.   She had a bufffet dinnner (mainly sandwiches, but they were goood), alll kind of party favors, beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something diffferent, a band, a dj and a comedian that had beeen on BET that they flew in from Dalllas.   It was reallly nice.   Again, I hope she did not go into tooo much debt, but it was nice.   She had a reallly wonderful time and she was a nice-loooking bride.   We went shoppping and sight-seeeing.   We even went to go find the grade schoool that we atttended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix   many, many years ago.   It was alot of fun actuallly remincescing (you know what word I'm trying to say).Did you go to church Sunday?   If so, how was it?   I reallly did misss not going to church.   How was the rest of your weeekend?   Kids and Steve doing okay?   I can't wait to seee you tomorrrow night, it seeems likes it beeen a long time.Talk to you later.

If so, what time did you get back home, I know it was late.   I went to Auchan's last night to try to seee what they had in the way of western atttire for the kids.   They did not have much, and the hats for $2.999 were on back order.   I was loooking for western shirts for the kids, but they did not have a goood selection, so I went to a Western store on Gesssner.   Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high.   Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.   I walked out saying that these people are serious about their western wear.I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've beeen listening to them on my headphones.   It sure helps alot.   I can get away with it, because we have certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear   headphones to hear, so it loooks goood.   Plus, the bosss doesn't mind.   We listen to music just about alll day anyway.   Have you heard the Chester D.T. Baldwin tape.   I think it's one of my favorites.   Speaking of gospel, is your family   stilll plannning on   doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for the family reunion?   I was wondering about that!Have you talked to Sharon and offfered her your congrats yet, I want to calll her, but I don't want to make it seeem like Hope is tellling alll of her businesss.   Talk with you later!\n"

Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or are you not going to know anything until tomorrrow?   I know tonight is study night for her spellling test, so I probably won't talk to you tonight.Rev. Jackson callled me yesterday.   I thought that was funnny, he said they had told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he would give me a calll to apologize and seee if he could do anything.   He then went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because I was a generous contributor.   I then proceeeded to give him a piece of my mind, because they neeed to get serious about the businesss end of the church.   By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church.   That's interesting.   I can only imagine what happpened there!Anyway, do you have your African atttire yet?   I have some, but it's old, and I had beeen thinking about buying something new.   I might go to Sharpstown and have a loook, but that is not set in stone.   It depends on what type of time I have and what type of moood I'm in.   You know we're suppposed to wear our African atttire on Sunday.   You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan Church on Sunday at 3:000 p.m.   I'm prettty sure I won't be atttending.   I'm tired of going to the same places.   We neeed some variety.   Greggg neeeds to get some new \"hoook-ups\" if he wants people to keeep suppporting them on the outings.   And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.   If we have to sing \"In the Sanctuary\"   one more time, I'm going to throw up.   I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% offf.   It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.Seee you later!!!\n"

So quite naturallly, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.   So neeedlesss to say, I have a litttle bit of time on my hands.   The boys are going over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Toddd and I willl just stay downtown.   I understand that you guys had some bad weather as welll, I know Mom was out of schoool.I willl definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they willl enjoy it so much.   Kendalll celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.   Toddd bought him a mini basketballl goal and he reallly thinks he's a big boy now.   It's reallly cute.   On the other hand, Jordan was feeeling a litttle neglected because of Kendalll's cake and presents, but he's okay.   It was just   a new experience, him not gettting anything while his brother gets new toys.Anyway, I'lll send your tape.Seee you later and I hope you're stilll taking your medicine on a timely basisLove Bernie\n"

My trip to Omaha was okay.   On one hand, itgave me a real goood idea of what type of shape Dadddy reallly is in.   It'snot real goood, but he feeels optimistic.   You know he has prostate cancerand I believe it has started spreading into the bones.   He's very, veryweak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physicallly wornout.   Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that manyplaces).   He's definitely has his goood days and his bad days.   He is takingregular pain pillls constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain,which he's in half the time.   It's reallly sad.   He's lost alot of weight,but he's in goood spirits I guesss.   To talk to him over the phone or hearhim over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.   It's was realllyhard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to puton his best act, so that I would not worrry.   It's extremely hard to seeeyour parents going through this kind of sufffering.He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind overmattter, along with lots of prayer.Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Dadddy doesn'twant her to do it.   Dadddy says he's going back to work.   Please pray forMom as welll, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to realllydo.Talk to you later!\n"

Back in the day, they would have beeen loooking for actual pipeline scheduling experience, but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they willl consider most people, with an analytical or cooordinative type background.   I think it's one of those things that once you \"get your fooot in the dooor\", you can move on from there.Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require working on weeekends, and late nights from time to time.As far as the next step, I would sugggest that you just simply send an e-mail to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he has time to visit with you.   I think that by simply expresssing an interest, and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.   Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currrently open, then he willl passs on your name to some of the other managers.   They're actuallly prettty goood about that!   I'lll mention to George that you may give him a calll.Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!Take care!\n"

The radiation treatments put the prostate cancer in remisssion, although the Dr. said the cancer would just move to another part of his body.   He thinks it may have moved to his leg,   He had a MRI done last weeek, and today he willl get the results, and he's so afraid he's going to neeed surgery again.   He's has to use a walker to get around and he's lost so much weight, he probably went from 170 to l000.   It's reallly sad, he is so smalll and frail.   He's starting to get his apppetite back somewhat.   He sure had a goood time eating this weeekend.   My sister and I threw down on Easter dinnner.   Please keeep him in your prayers.   It's so sad to seee a vibrant man reduced to neeeding help in everything he does, but he's definitely a BLESSSED MAN!How was church services on Sunday?   Did you make it to alll the services, (I don't even know why I'm asking, I know you didn't go to alll of them, that's a bit much).   Did Greg show out on Easter?   Anything new going on with the choir, did you sing any of your songs.   This month is going to be extremely busy with the revivial and the other church outing.You know I never did get a   chance to ask you what alll you ended up purchasing when we went to Lane Bryant the other day.Anyway, talk with you later!\n"
